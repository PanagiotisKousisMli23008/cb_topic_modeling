1,"Though research examining cybercrime has surged in recent years, studies exploring perceptions concerning these phenomena have been scant. In fact, little is known regarding the extent to which individuals perceive cybercrime as serious, whether exposure to cybercrime terminology elicit similar perceptions of seriousness as behavioural descriptions of cybercrime, and the factors predicting perceptions of cybercrime seriousness. While research examining offline crime has found a significant relationship between individuals' adoption of misleading stereotypes and perceived crime seriousness, no study to date has explored this association within a cybercrime context. As such, using data collected from 504 Mechanical Turk adult respondents, the current study examined: (1) the extent to which individuals perceived cybercrime (generally) as serious, (2) whether perceptions of cybercrime seriousness were differentially influenced based on whether cybercrime terms (e.g., 'hacking', 'cyberstalking') were provided relative to behavioural definitions, and (3) whether respondents' adoption of cybercrime misbeliefs significantly impacted perceptions of cybercrime seriousness, net of other factors (i.e., comfort with and use of technology, demographic traits). The findings revealed that while more individuals perceived cybercrime as serious when behavioural definitions were provided, the majority of respondents did not perceive cybercrime (generally) as serious. Further, greater adoption of cybercrime misbeliefs and frequent device use were significant predictors of perceived cybercrime seriousness only when behavioural definitions were given. In addition, older respondents were more likely to view cybercrime as serious, while men were less likely to view cybercrime as serious in both models. Collectively, the findings reveal the need for effective educational and awareness campaigns, which are discussed in detail.","Though research examining cybercrime surged recent years, studies exploring perceptions concerning phenomena scant. fact, little known regarding extent individuals perceive cybercrime serious, whether exposure cybercrime terminology elicit similar perceptions seriousness behavioural descriptions cybercrime, factors predicting perceptions cybercrime seriousness. research examining offline crime found significant relationship individuals' adoption misleading stereotypes perceived crime seriousness, study date explored association within cybercrime context. such, using data collected 504 Mechanical Turk adult respondents, current study examined: (1) extent individuals perceived cybercrime (generally) serious, (2) whether perceptions cybercrime seriousness differentially influenced based whether cybercrime terms (e.g., 'hacking', 'cyberstalking') provided relative behavioural definitions, (3) whether respondents' adoption cybercrime misbeliefs significantly impacted perceptions cybercrime seriousness, net factors (i.e., comfort use technology, demographic traits). findings revealed individuals perceived cybercrime serious behavioural definitions provided, majority respondents perceive cybercrime (generally) serious.

2,"In recent years, cybercrime has become one of the most rapidly growing areas of crime. The emergence of new technologies has presented new cybercrime opportunities that are becoming more sophisticated. As a result, individuals, corporations and government find themselves faced with many cybercrime threats that range from data breaches to ransomware. Some of the criminals responsible for these acts operate from the Deep Web, a segment of the Web that an ordinary person has no access or even knowledge of its existence. That is because the Web is segmented into Surface Web, where search engines such as Google or Bing have access and the Deep web is where normal search engines have no access. The Deep Web also contains a small portion called the Dark Web that is hidden from standard web browsers. Access to this portion of the web requires through specialized privacy tools with complex encryption and channeling techniques. This portion of the Web is where cybercriminals perform illegal e -commerce businesses, transnational money laundering, sell compromised banking information, specially crafted malware, leaked personal information and intellectual property. The trading of malware payloads, phishing toolkits and exploits by cybercriminals is also making it easier for anyone without comprehensive technical skills to participate in online illegal activities. South Africa has seen a rapid increase in cybercrime due to the growth and improvement broadband connectivity and ICT infrastructure in both the private and public sectors. The platform aims to address the cyber threat posed by these cyber activities that are taking place in the surface web and the dark web targeting the South African environment. The platform also includes multifaceted cybercrime combatting features, such as detecting and proactively identifying cybercrime activities, preventing and minimizing cybercrime through information sharing, and protecting users and relevant stakeholders against emerging cybercrime activities using proactive techniques.","recent years, cybercrime become one rapidly growing areas crime. emergence new technologies presented new cybercrime opportunities becoming sophisticated. result, individuals, corporations government find faced many cybercrime threats range data breaches ransomware. criminals responsible acts operate Deep Web, segment Web ordinary person access even knowledge existence.

3,"Numerous factors such as sociodemographic characteristics contribute to cybercrime victimisation. Previous research suggests that neighbourhood plays a role in cybercrime perpetration. However, despite the theoretical importance and particular interest to law enforcement agencies and policymakers, local area variations in cybercrime victimisation have rarely been examined. Drawing on data from recorded cybercrime incidents within one of the largest police forces in England from a three-year period with a victim dataset of 5,270 individuals enhanced by the Census data, this research untangles the relationships between demographics of cybercrime victims and their resident area characteristics. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to apply statistical analysis to routinely collected police data to gain insight into the cybercrime victimisation that occurs across crime types in relation to demographics and area-level variations. The results of the study will provide valuable insights into policing cybercrime in England and beyond.","Numerous factors sociodemographic characteristics contribute cybercrime victimisation.

4,"Cybercrime is a global, transnational serious problem that needs strong technical and legal responses. The information represents an important asset that must be secured and properly used as it provides the support for value creation and sustainable development. Being a valuable asset, the information is exposed to continuous and virulent attacks conducted by cybercrime groups and significant financial and human resources have to be allocated to the cybercrime limitation. The purpose of authors' research was to get more knowledge about cybercrime and attacker's behaviour and to develop a discussion on the cyber security and the means of its improvement. The research results attempt to provide useful recommendations on countermeasures against cybercrime and raise the awareness of companies' senior management and governments' representatives on cyber criminality.","Cybercrime global, transnational serious problem needs strong technical legal responses. information represents important asset must secured properly used provides support value creation sustainable development. valuable asset, information exposed continuous virulent attacks conducted cybercrime groups significant financial human resources allocated cybercrime limitation. purpose authors' research get knowledge cybercrime attacker's behaviour develop discussion cyber security means improvement. research results attempt provide useful recommendations countermeasures cybercrime raise awareness companies' senior management governments' representatives cyber criminality.","Cybercrime global, transnational serious problem need strong technical legal responses. information represents important asset must secured properly used provides support value creation sustainable development. valuable asset, information exposed continuous virulent attack conducted cybercrime group significant financial human resource allocated cybercrime limitation. purpose authors' research get knowledge cybercrime attacker's behaviour develop discussion cyber security mean improvement. research result attempt provide useful recommendation countermeasure cybercrime raise awareness companies' senior management governments' representative cyber criminality."
