Abstract
Though research examining cybercrime has surged in recent years, studies exploring perceptions concerning these phenomena have been scant. In fact, little is known regarding the extent to which individuals perceive cybercrime as serious, whether exposure to cybercrime terminology elicit similar perceptions of seriousness as behavioural descriptions of cybercrime, and the factors predicting perceptions of cybercrime seriousness. While research examining offline crime has found a significant relationship between individuals' adoption of misleading stereotypes and perceived crime seriousness, no study to date has explored this association within a cybercrime context. As such, using data collected from 504 Mechanical Turk adult respondents, the current study examined: (1) the extent to which individuals perceived cybercrime (generally) as serious, (2) whether perceptions of cybercrime seriousness were differentially influenced based on whether cybercrime terms (e.g., 'hacking', 'cyberstalking') were provided relative to behavioural definitions, and (3) whether respondents' adoption of cybercrime misbeliefs significantly impacted perceptions of cybercrime seriousness, net of other factors (i.e., comfort with and use of technology, demographic traits). The findings revealed that while more individuals perceived cybercrime as serious when behavioural definitions were provided, the majority of respondents did not perceive cybercrime (generally) as serious. Further, greater adoption of cybercrime misbeliefs and frequent device use were significant predictors of perceived cybercrime seriousness only when behavioural definitions were given. In addition, older respondents were more likely to view cybercrime as serious, while men were less likely to view cybercrime as serious in both models. Collectively, the findings reveal the need for effective educational and awareness campaigns, which are discussed in detail.
In recent years, cybercrime has become one of the most rapidly growing areas of crime. The emergence of new technologies has presented new cybercrime opportunities that are becoming more sophisticated. As a result, individuals, corporations and government find themselves faced with many cybercrime threats that range from data breaches to ransomware. Some of the criminals responsible for these acts operate from the Deep Web, a segment of the Web that an ordinary person has no access or even knowledge of its existence. That is because the Web is segmented into Surface Web, where search engines such as Google or Bing have access and the Deep web is where normal search engines have no access. The Deep Web also contains a small portion called the Dark Web that is hidden from standard web browsers. Access to this portion of the web requires through specialized privacy tools with complex encryption and channeling techniques. This portion of the Web is where cybercriminals perform illegal e -commerce businesses, transnational money laundering, sell compromised banking information, specially crafted malware, leaked personal information and intellectual property. The trading of malware payloads, phishing toolkits and exploits by cybercriminals is also making it easier for anyone without comprehensive technical skills to participate in online illegal activities. South Africa has seen a rapid increase in cybercrime due to the growth and improvement broadband connectivity and ICT infrastructure in both the private and public sectors. The platform aims to address the cyber threat posed by these cyber activities that are taking place in the surface web and the dark web targeting the South African environment. The platform also includes multifaceted cybercrime combatting features, such as detecting and proactively identifying cybercrime activities, preventing and minimizing cybercrime through information sharing, and protecting users and relevant stakeholders against emerging cybercrime activities using proactive techniques.
Numerous factors such as sociodemographic characteristics contribute to cybercrime victimisation. Previous research suggests that neighbourhood plays a role in cybercrime perpetration. However, despite the theoretical importance and particular interest to law enforcement agencies and policymakers, local area variations in cybercrime victimisation have rarely been examined. Drawing on data from recorded cybercrime incidents within one of the largest police forces in England from a three-year period with a victim dataset of 5,270 individuals enhanced by the Census data, this research untangles the relationships between demographics of cybercrime victims and their resident area characteristics. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to apply statistical analysis to routinely collected police data to gain insight into the cybercrime victimisation that occurs across crime types in relation to demographics and area-level variations. The results of the study will provide valuable insights into policing cybercrime in England and beyond.
Cybercrime is a global, transnational serious problem that needs strong technical and legal responses. The information represents an important asset that must be secured and properly used as it provides the support for value creation and sustainable development. Being a valuable asset, the information is exposed to continuous and virulent attacks conducted by cybercrime groups and significant financial and human resources have to be allocated to the cybercrime limitation. The purpose of authors' research was to get more knowledge about cybercrime and attacker's behaviour and to develop a discussion on the cyber security and the means of its improvement. The research results attempt to provide useful recommendations on countermeasures against cybercrime and raise the awareness of companies' senior management and governments' representatives on cyber criminality.
In Digital Era, businesses and economy become global easily, helped by innovative technologies. Nowadays, mankind depends on Internet, computer and technology. Trade, services, data flows, have crossed the national borders, transforming into a global market that can be easily accessed. These new technologies like mobile internet, cloud technology or advanced robotics lead to economic growth, transform our lives, our jobs and the traditional business models, but also have a significant disadvantage: cause the evolution of the new type of crime - cybercrime. On the global scale, crimes are committed by electronic means, being facilitated by technological progress, considering the speed of data transfer or the number of persons connected globally to the network, anytime. The aim of this article is to present the challenges of Digital Era, the vulnerability to cybercrime, analysing the influence of digital technologies for cybercrime, including illicit financial flows. Also, it will be presented the newest cybercrime tactics and their costs, for explaining the significance of this phenomenon and for identifying ways of minimize its impact. Technological advance and globalization impose a fast adjustment to changes of the global business environment for succeed, but also for efficiently control cybercrime. The fight for cybercrime should be global, being absolutely necessary the international cooperation of organizations and countries in order to create and to permanently update the legal framework. Consequently, cybersecurity must represent an important objective offered by corporations and government, which must prevent cybercrimes, using technological advance as a benefit.
In this study it is carried out a detailed analysis of cybercrime related to the definition of this notion as well as to the concept of criminology in cyberspace. Also, in this study are presented and analyzed the virtual communities, being carried out an analysis about the role played by the criminal law in regulating virtual communities. It is also presented the concept of virtual worlds, being carried out an analysis of challenges for the criminal justice system.
Individuals, organizations and nation-states are increasingly falling victim to cyberattacks. A lot of research on how to understand the modus operandi of a cyber attacker through the MITRE ATT&CK framework, CAPEC enumeration and various cyber kill chain frame-works has been available for cyber incident responders for both pre-attack defensive posture preparation as well as post-attack mapping of the indicators. Cybercrime, on the other hand, has a very different set of motives, majorly financial, but also imper-sonation, harassment and hate crimes, which are targeted mostly towards individuals who are vulnerable. Investigative offcers in cyber cells around the world use various investigative processes in their attempt to solve a cybercrime incident, detect the criminal(s), recover the lost money, shut down the accounts of perpetrators, or bring down the cyber-criminal gangs involved in reported cyber-crime incidents. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no framework to map the cybercrime incident narratives to the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by cybercriminals, nor are the processes used by cybercrime investigating offcers mapped to such TTPs to create a systematic modus operandi for the in-vestigators to solve a cybercrime, cluster multiple crime incidents as attributable to a specific cybercrime operator, or systematically map a set of evidence collected to a pattern of TTPs. In this paper, we present a TTP-based framework for classified cybercrimes to formulate a comprehensive strategy for cybercrime interpretation and action recommendations for law enforcement offcers, which can be used as a reference point to establish targeted threat models and incident response methodologies for cybercrime investigations.
"Cybercrime investigations often transcend national boundaries. This creates problems for investigators because the procedural laws that govern the conduct of criminal investigations are territorially-based; that is, they apply only within the territory of the country which promulgated those laws. Cybercrime investigations often require that evidence be traced, preserved and collected in more than one country, which of course means that the process is governing by the laws of multiple nations. The formal processes that have been created to govern transnational evidence-gathering are cumbersome and ineffective in cybercrime investigations, which move quickly; officers therefore tend to rely on informal methods, which are idiosyncratic in nature."
This paper presents a cybercrime in medical devices such as all of devices feed in RJ-45. The reason of the physician can monitoring the patient's data from medical devices in hospital and how to protect them using technique of anti-crime, we study behavior of hacker to fine history of his/her crime and understanding cybercrime method. Finally we use as forensic evidence by analyzing signal data from a database of DSI database crime comparison with cybercrime investigation. The result was that there was no security in medical devices procedure bad effects.
Cybercrime investigators, in an attempt to rid Nigeria of cybercrime, go about arresting and demanding for digital devices, of unsuspecting members of the public, especially Nigerian youths. Upon seizing these digital devices, they compel the owners to surrender security features to gain access to the devices to fish for cybercrime evidence. The rampant nature of this investigative process partly culminated in the recent 'ENDSARS' protests in Nigeria that commenced in cyberspace with the hashtag #ENDSARS NOW. Although the ENDSARS protest has become a topic of discourse in the news, literature, and academic domain, there seems to be limited or no literature on the cybercrime perspectives of the protests. This paper seeks to answer the question: To what extent can cybercrime investigators legally gain access to digital devices and social networks of persons? It concludes that to avoid future protests against cybercrime investigators, implementing a structured cybercrime investigation process in conformity with best practices, as it is done in developed economies like the United States of America, is suggested.
This article aims to establish the particularities of cybercrime in Nigeria and whether these suggest problems with prevailing taxonomies of cybercrime. Nigeria is representative of the Sub-Saharan region, and an exemplary cultural context to illustrate the importance of incorporating social and contextual factors into cybercrime classifications. This paper anchors upon a basic principle of categorisation alongside motivational theories, to offer a tripartite conceptual framework for grouping cybercrime nexus. It argues that cybercrimes are motivated by three possible factors: socioeconomic, psychosocial and geopolitical. Whilst this contribution challenges the statistics relied on to inform the prevalence of cybercrime perpetrators across nations, it provides new ways of making sense of the voluminous variances of cybercrime. Concomitantly, it enables a clearer conceptualisation of cybercrime in Nigeria and elsewhere, because jurisdictional cultures and nuances apply online as they do offline. (C) 2016 The Author.

"This keynote will explore the broader issue of using socio-technical artificial intelligence (AI) systems in criminology for responding to cybercrime and cybersecurity issues. It will focus upon the importance of matching the delivery of AI with the scientific (technical) claims for it within a socio-political world. By drawing upon research into cybercrime and cybersecurity (including recent ransomware research), the talk will discuss the realities, the strengths and weaknesses, of using AI with regard to attribution and investigating cybercrime, and also preventing attacks to systems. It will argue that the meanings, logic and understandings of AI systems differ across disciplines which can result in significant differences in expectations. The broad conclusion is that because of this an interdisciplinary approach needs to be taken and that AI it is not a silver bullet. AI systems may be useful, for example, in responding to some cybercrimes, but not others, or effective in addressing stages of a cybercrime event, such as preventing malware infection; and even then, only with some major caveats. More importantly, is the recognition that AI cannot actually make hard decisions, but it can reasonably inform aspects of the decision-making processes of practitioners, professionals, policy makers and politicians who are mandated to make them. It is not only important to match the delivery of scientific claims with consumer expectations in order to maintain public confidence in the public security sector, but also because an arms races is developing as offenders are also beginning to employ AI in a number of different ways to help them victimize individuals, organisations and nation states [1]. The first part of this talk will draw upon existing examples to explore the general issue of using socio-technical AI systems to deal with crime and policing in a risk society [2] [3], before identifying some of the additional challenges presented by AI and cybercrime and cybersecurity [4] [5]. The second part will look at the methodological and socio-political problems of delivering science solutions within a socio-political world. The third part will conclude by discussing the practical realities, strengths and weaknesses, of using AI regarding attribution and investigating cybercrime, and preventing attacks to systems."
Cybercrime is becoming ever more serious. Findings from the 2002 Computer Crime and Security Survey show an upward trend that demonstrates a need for a timely review of existing approaches to fighting this new phenomenon in the information age. In this paper, we define different types of cybercrime and review previous research and current status of fighting cybercrime in different countries that rely on legal, organizational, and technological approaches. We focus on a case study of fighting cybercrime in Taiwan and discuss problems faced. Finally, we propose several recommendations to advance the work of fighting cybercrime. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Endangerment from cybercrime is increasing since enterprises have become a part of the global cyberspace and are now more dependent on modern technology. Cyber criminality in the sphere of business comprises a wide circle of perpetrators, from individuals to organized groups. All of them represent a different level of threat/risk to information security, and that is why enterprises should be familiar with their own vulnerability. This paper shows the state of cybercrime in Slovenian enterprises and spotlights the most dangerous cyber threats on which security measures should be focused. Design/methodology/approach: The vulnerability of Slovenian organizations in regard to cybercrime was investigated with the use of a questionnaire and by statistical analysis of the survey responses. Theoretical premises were formed by using the descriptive method with analytical techniques and by a synthesis of various viewpoints proposed by different authors. Findings: Cybercrime in the business sphere is becoming more organized and sophisticated, since information is the base-stone of competitiveness in the corporate world. In this age of ubiquitous information and communication technology, unauthorized acquisition and use of information capital has become attainable to many perpetrators. We have concluded that the greatest threat to corporate information systems weren't the most common forms of cyber criminality but the less visible cybercrime techniques used by the most sophisticated and organized perpetrators. It is evident that the present level of protection against cybercrime is inadequate therefore significant changes in organizational information security policies should be made. Research limitations/implications: The survey and analysis of cyber criminality in the Slovenian corporate environment were limited to a relatively small number of respondents because most organizations refused to participate in the survey. This lessens the validity of the survey results. We have also encountered biased responses about how much damage certain organizations have already sustained, because publicly acknowledging information security incidences tarnishes business reputation. Originality/value: An overview of the vulnerability of information systems regarding the qualitative and quantitative effects of certain forms of cybercrime enabled us to identify critical vulnerabilities and the necessary measures which should be implemented to raise the current level of information security in the Slovenian corporate environment.
The mass-production of online websites is one of the most confrontations of detecting cybercriminal activities. Monitoring the construction or visitation of such websites is somewhat unsophisticated process if it relies on filtering the URL addresses alone, like Proxy. However, user online interactions can be concealed if passed through security protocols or anonymity networks, like Tor. Nowadays, Tor has been widely used to conceal website addresses, web page contents, user actions, and user anonymity. On the other hand, website traffic analysis and fingerprinting techniques endeavor to break such privacy by revealing user actions and anonymity. Basically, this is considered as a negative behavior. However, in this paper, we study how fingerprinting techniques can positively be adapted by Internet Service Providers to be used against Cybercrime activities. In other words, fingerprinting techniques can play a vital role for investigating and mitigating cybercrimes. We present several fingerprinting techniques and countermeasures from a cybercrime point of view. Then, we (1) illustrate how fingerprinting techniques can be applied as cybercrime investigation models, and (2) discuss the expected challenges of such application.
The causations of crimes that are relevant in the cyberspace concurrently impact in the physical space and vise versa. This paper aims to explore parents' perceptions of the factors that cause socioeconomic cybercrime in Nigeria. Despite a long-standing view that the juvenile offenders of today could become the hardened criminals of tomorrow, and the conclusions of a number of developmental theories on the stability of delinquency across the life course, the existing data on cybercrimes in Nigeria have principally been derived from studies involving university students. Yet, individuals' moral-standard-levels, which shape their offending capacities, are mostly developed in childhood. The empirical basis for this paper is face-to-face interviews with 17 Nigerian parents regarding children's vulnerability to involvement in cybercrime. Drawing upon qualitative data, this paper argues that a complex web of familial factors and structural forces, alongside cultural forces, explains the degree of cybercrime involvement on the part of Nigerian youths.
After a physical crime occurs an important action typically takes place: the reporting of the crime to the police. However, this action becomes more complex for a victim to properly execute when a cybercrime is experienced, which can be partly explained for instance by a lack of knowledge about cybercrimes and computer security. Cybercrime reporting is crucial because it can provide a multitude of data such as the prevalence of cybercrimes, the types and nature of the cybercrimes present, and the various resulting types of loss or harm (e.g., financial, psychological, emotional). Moreover, cybercrime reporting data is also actionable for two reasons: (1) prevention tips can be produced to educate users of how they can mitigate commonly occurring cybercrimes they may be faced with, and (2) the information provided can be useful for the appropriate law enforcement agencies to potentially reach a proper resolution for the cybercrime victim (i.e., the cybercriminal being caught, the recovery of stolen property). However, comparatively few academic works have focused on better understanding computer users' cybercrime reporting behaviors. In this paper, we first review the relevant literature, which predominantly focuses on the reasons that contribute to the underreporting of cybercrimes. Next, we highlight four particular challenges of cybercrime reporting. These challenges include the issue of computer users potentially having difficulty in properly identifying cybercrimes they may experience, fostering knowledge of how to report cybercrimes to the appropriate channels, providing incentives for cybercrime reporting, and the extent of feedback victims receive after filing a cybercrime report. Grounded in the surveyed literature and our previous work, we also provide a set of recommendations on how to approach these challenges in order to improve currently existing cybercrime reporting processes.
"Nowadays, many technology-based applications and systems embedded with cybercrimes threats and risks. Our communities lack the basic skills to secure against a smart cybercrime threats. This study conducted to test and evaluate the current cybercrime risks and awareness in Alnamas area, a district in the Southern part of Saudi Arabia. The study targeted a set of users who are highly familiar in using modern technology applications and services. All subjects are students from Bisha University, College of Science and Arts, Al-Namas. The study used 16 different parameters; each parameter covers a different cybercrime issue. The outputs showed that the reasons behind a cybercrime can be list in order as: sexual, financial, political, cultural, and fame. However, a social communication network is the most widely gateway for a cybercrime to occur (rate 69.6%). Generally, an anti-virus program is the only tool used as an anti-cybercrime technique. The results showed that, among the most common cybercrime occurred, is a sexual crime (registered the highest risk rate 57%). The study noticed that there is a lack of awareness in a cybercrime knowledge, and a strong interest for receiving an anti-cybercrime training modules (rate 80.7%)."
Underground forums contain many thousands of active users, but the vast majority will be involved, at most, in minor levels of deviance. The number who engage in serious criminal activity is small. That being said, underground forums have played a significant role in several recent high-profile cybercrime activities. In this work we apply data science approaches to understand criminal pathways and characterize key actors related to illegal activity in one of the largest and longest-running underground forums. We combine the results of a logistic regression model with k-means clustering and social network analysis, verifying the findings using topic analysis. We identify variables relating to forum activity that predict the likelihood a user will become an actor of interest to law enforcement, and would therefore benefit the most from intervention. This work provides the first step towards identifying ways to deter the involvement of young people away from a career in cybercrime.
Ensuring national security in cyberspace is becoming an increasingly important issue, given the growing number of cybercrimes due to adaptation to new security and protection technologies. The purpose of this article is to study the features of counteracting, preventing, and detecting crimes in the virtual space of Ukraine on the example of cases and analysis of the State Center for Cyber Defense and Countering Cyber Threats CERT-UA and the Cyber Police Department of the National Police of Ukraine. The research methodology is based on the method of analysis and study of cases of crime detection in the virtual environment of the State Center for Cyber Defense and Countering Cyber Threats CERT-UA and the Cyber Police Department of the National Police of Ukraine. The results show that the consistent development of the legal framework in 2016-2020 and the development of a cyber-defense strategy for 2021-2025 had a positive impact on the institution-building and detection of cybercrime in Ukraine. Establishing cooperation with developed countries (USA) has helped to combat cybercrime by facilitating investigations by US law enforcement agencies. This means that international experience is effective for developing countries as a way to quickly understand the threats and risks of cybercrime. In Ukraine, the main number of incidents concerns the distribution of malicious software in the public sector. In the private sector, cyber police are largely confronted with the misappropriation of citizens' income through Internet technology. The practical value of this study is to systematize the experience of overcoming cybercrime on the example of cases of crime detection in a virtual environment.
This study analyzes 0-day vulnerabilities in the broader context of cybercrime and economic markets. The work is based on the interviews of several leading experts and on a field research of the authors. In particular, cybercrime is considered when involving traditional criminal activities or when military operations are involved. A description of different 0-day vulnerability markets - White, Black and Government markets - is provided, as well as the characteristics of malware factories and their major customers are discussed.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use Maguire's (2003) theory of police organizations to explain whether police agencies dedicate specific personnel to cybercrime response. Design/methodology/approach Data from this study come from the 2013 Law Enforcement Management and Statistics survey. Maguire's (2003) theory of the organizational structure of police organizations is used to measure organizational variables related to context, complexity and control. Logistic regression is used to examine whether these organizational characteristics are related to cybercrime response. Findings The results suggest that organizational context, complexity and control are related to cybercrime response. Specifically, in terms of context, larger agencies, agencies whose officers engage in more non-routine tasks, and agencies governed by an active collective bargaining agreement are more likely to dedicate specific resources to cybercrime. In terms of complexity, agencies with more hierarchical layers, agencies that utilize more specialization and agencies that make greater use of civilian employees are more likely to dedicate specific personnel to cybercrime. Finally, regarding control, agencies that assign non-sworn personnel to administrative tasks are more likely to dedicate resources to cybercrime response. Originality/value This study is one of the first to use this framework to examine the relationship between organizational characteristics and cybercrime response. It shows that this perspective can be useful for understanding police organizations and police policies, programs and strategies.
Nowadays, cybercrime is growing rapidly around the world, as new technologies, applications and networks emerge. In addition, the Deep Web has contributed to the growth of illegal activities in cyberspace. As a result, cybercriminals are taking advantage of system vulnerabilities for their own benefit. This article presents the history and conceptualization of cybercrime, explores different categorizations of cybercriminals and cyberattacks, and sets forth our exhaustive cyberattack typology, or taxonomy. Common categories include where the computer is the target to commit the crime, where the computer is used as a tool to perpetrate the felony, or where a digital device is an incidental condition to the execution of a crime. We conclude our study by analyzing lessons learned and future actions that can be undertaken to tackle cybercrime and harden cybersecurity at all levels.
"The advancement of information and communication technologies opens new venues and ways for cybercriminals to commit crime. There are several different types of cybercrime offences that need to be treated in a separate and different manner. The major international source that provides guidelines for treatment of cybercrime is the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council of Europe and the European Commission Action Plan. The purpose of the paper is to present, discuss and analyze the Macedonian legislation treating cybercrime, with respect to the specific cases typically encountered in practice and the international guidelines concerning cybercrime. The major source of cybercrime legislation in Macedonia is the Criminal Code with provisions thereof in ten of its articles; it addresses cybercrimes such as personal data abuse, copyright and piracy issues, production and distribution of child pornography, computer viruses, intrusions into computer systems, computer fraud and computer forgery. We also present and analyze reports on cybercrime complaints and victims from Macedonia, issued by the Internet Crime Complaint Center and the Macedonian Ministry of Internal Affairs. The reports reveal the unusually high number of complaints for perpetrators and victims originating from Macedonia. Furthermore, we highlight several recent cybercrime cases reported in Macedonia. All things considered, the Macedonian penal legislation is modern and it follows the current European and world standards. It provides guidelines for successful resolution of cybercrime committed in the Republic of Macedonia. However, it could be improved by a more active inclusion of Macedonian authorities in the global response to cybercrime and by stronger enforcement of cybercrime prevention measures and strategies."
With the development of ICT and the Internet, there was barely any inclination that it could transform itself into a pervading revolution that could be misused for criminal activities. Cybercrime is increasing more rapidly than expected. IBM estimated in 2016 that by 2019 the global cost of cybercrime will reach $2 trillion, a threefold increase from the 2015 estimate of $500 billion. Organised crime is using cyber platforms in a much more sophisticated way that requires a highly skilled and specialised law enforcement response. Cryptocurrencies creates the opportunity for criminals to hide proceeds and the use of cryptocurrency mining malware is resulting in cybercriminals believing they are cashing in on unprecedented successes of these currencies. Regulatory measures have to be updated to effectively respond to unlawful activities relating to cybercrime. A holistic approach must be used by governments to develop a strategy and implementation plan to address the phenomenon of cybercrime for law enforcement. Currently, most African countries address cybercrime in an uncoordinated and fragmented way. This paper presents a framework for African countries to develop and implement a national cybercrime strategy.
The Internet can be a double-edged sword. While offering a range of benefits, it also provides an opportunity for criminals to extend their work to areas previously unimagined. Every country faces the same challenges regarding the fight against cybercrime and how to effectively promote security for its citizens and organisations. The main aim of this study is to introduce and apply a data-mining technique (decision-tree) to cybercrime profiling. This paper also aims to draw attention to the growing number of cybercrime victims, and the relationship between online behaviour and computer victimisation. This study used secondhand data collected for a study was carried out using Jordan as a case study to investigate whether or not individuals effectively protect themselves against cybercrime, and to examine how perception of law influences actions towards incidents of cybercrime. In Jordan, cybercafes have become culturally acceptable alternatives for individuals wishing to access the Internet in private, away from the prying eyes of society.
This Modern Technology is almost inspirable from our daily life. Since its beginning in the 1990s, the internet has a vast electronic network. This network consist of millions of devices which is hyper-connected to each other. With the advancement of technology in last few decades in each sector, cyber crime is also increases day by day using these technologies. Cybercrime is a crime that involves in a computer and a network. In the 21 century, cyber criminals are so smart and working in collaborative manner which makes cybercrime as serious issues for all over the world. These types of people done several types of crime like fmancial crimes, cyber pornography, online gambling, cyber defamation, virus/warm, web jacking, email spoofing, data diddling etc. It is necessary to fight back to these types of culprits to save the people, so there are several organizations who are continuously working to prevent cybercrime like Government agencies, Police department, Cyber crime bureau etc. Cyber security means protecting infonnation and information systems (networks, computers, data bases, data centers and applications) with technological security. When we hear about Cyber crime Our focus is gone on cyber Security. In this paper, we gives detailed infonnation regarding cybercrime and how can we prevent crime and its internal security, types of crime, internal security challenges, cases of internal security. With increasing use of information technology (IT) enabled services such as e-governance, online business and electronic transactions protection of personal and sensitive data have assumed paramount importance. The economic growth of any nation and its internal security depends on how well is its cyberspace secured and protected.
Cybercrime and cyberterrorism remain important problems of today's society. Insufficient resources for the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism require research activities in this field to be allocated where the gaps exist. This paper presents results of the COURAGE project process to identify missing research items in the area of cybercrime and cyberterrorism. In total, 12 main issues that need further research are identified and described in detail. The results that are part of the COURAGE research agenda are important for various stakeholders, such as researchers, industry, policy makers, and law enforcement agencies.
As the world becomes increasingly connected and interdependent upon technology, crimes are moving online. Research on cybercrime is beginning to test the applicability of traditional criminological theories for understanding crime in this new medium. Using a national sample of 215 self-admitted cybercriminals, we examine Messner and Rosenfeld's institutional anomie theory. Negative binomial regressions reveal that expressed levels of institutional anomie correlate with increased cybercrime activity. A curvilinear relationship was found, such that low and high levels of institutional anomie lead to higher levels of cybercrime. Our findings reveal how the dark side of the American Dream can lead to online criminality. Specifically, the penetration of, and accommodation to economic values dictated by American capitalism can lead individuals to adopt values such as the fetishism of money that, in turn, affects their online behavior and criminality.
In recent years, a new term has arisen cybercrime-which essentially denotes the use of computer technology to commit or to facilitate the commission of unlawful acts, or crimes. This article explains why we treat cybercrime as a special class of crime and why we need special statutes to define cybercrime offenses. It explains the relationship between state and federal law, notes the various types of cybercrimes and surveys the offenses that are created by state and federal law in the United States.
"This article shows that while cybercrime and counterfeiting are related phenomena, they do not necessarily form a single global hybrid system; each network retains its own characteristics. By juxtaposing our current conceptual understandings of cybercrime and counterfeiting, we destabilize both concepts and rethink the fundamentals. We also offer some analytical tools that can enable more focused and effective countermeasures."
Artificial monitoring is no longer able to match the rapid growth of cybercrime, it is in great need to develop a new spatial analysis technology which allows emergency events to get rapidly and accurately locked in real environment, furthermore, to establish correlative analysis model for cybercrime prevention strategy. On the other hand, Geography information system has been changed virtually in data structure, coordinate system and analysis model due to the uncertainty and hyper-dimension characteristics of network object and behavior. In this paper, the spatial rules of typical cybercrime are explored on base of GIS with Internet searching and IP tracking technology: (1) Setup spatial database through IP searching based on criminal evidence. (2) Extend GIS data-structure and spatial models, add network dimension and virtual attribution to realize dynamic connection between cyber and real space. (3) Design cybercrime monitoring and prevention system to discover the cyberspace logics based on spatial analysis.
This article examines the feasibility of designing and implementing a cybercrime prevention monitoring approach to enhance the quality of knowledge about policies that aim to reduce the prevalence and impact of online harms. Despite very significant investments made by governments over the past decade to improve the cybersecurity of publicly and privately-operated computer systems, there is very limited systematic knowledge about what cybercrime prevention policies have been adopted in various parts of the world and even less knowledge about their effectiveness in reducing the exposure of individuals and organizations to cybercrime. Borrowing from the policy monitoring (or policy surveillance) methodology that was developed in a broad range of fields such as public health and education, this article argues that such an approach would be critical in advancing our understanding of what is being done to control cybercrime, what works, what doesn't, and what is promising. This article provides an overview of the principles and benefits of the policy monitoring approach, reviews the main features of a sample of 18 policy monitoring platforms, assesses a dozen cybersecurity policy rating initiatives-concluding that very few of them include cybercrime in their framework, then provides a template for the creation of a dedicated cybercrime prevention monitoring tool that would benefit academics, policy-makers and practitioners.
Purpose Cybercrime rates have increased rapidly during the last couple of decades, resulting in cybercrimes becoming common crimes. However, most victims do not report cybercrimes to the police. Therefore, this study examines reporting cybercrime victimization and provides insights into the role of the police in this process. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 595 individuals was used. All respondents were shown three vignettes about hypothetical cybercrime victimization and were asked to imagine that this situation happened to them. Four crime and reporting characteristics were manipulated across vignettes. Respondents' intentions to report to the police and to other organizations were used as the dependent variables in regression analyses. Four random factors in the vignettes (i.e. type of crime, seriousness of crime, victim-perpetrator relationship, and reporting modality), as well as several characteristics of the respondents were included in the regression models as independent variables. Findings The type of cybercrime is the most important predictor for reporting behaviors. Other determinants are: more serious offenses were more often reported and offenses are less often reported in situations where the victim personally knows the perpetrator. Furthermore, there is large discrepancy between intended and actual cybercrime reporting. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that influence reporting behavior in the real world. Only a fifth of respondents indicated that they would not report cybercrime victimization to the police. This implies that attempts at improving reporting rates should not solely be focused on improving people's attitudes, but also on removing obstacles to turn these attitudes into actions. Originality/value In the current study, the authors contribute to the existing literature by asking a large sample from the general population in the Netherlands about both their intended reporting behavior (i.e. a vignette study) and their actual reporting behavior (i.e. self-reports) of victimization of a wide variety of different types of cybercrime. Determinants of both reporting to the police as well as to other organizations are examined. Moreover, respondents are asked about motivations behind their decision to (not) report a cybercrime to the police. Last, people were asked about their past experiences with reporting cybercrime victimization to the police.
"Purpose This paper explores the various challenges associated with policing cybercrime, arguing that a failure to improve law enforcement responses to cybercrime may negatively impact their institutional legitimacy as reliable first responders. Further, the paper makes preliminary links between cybercrime and the paradigm of evidence-based policing (EBP), providing suggestions on how the paradigm can assist, develop, and improve a myriad of factors associated with policing cybercrime. Design/methodology/approach Three examples of prominent cybercrime incidents will be explored under the lens of institutional theory: the cyberextortion of Amanda Todd; the hacking of Ashley Madison; and the 2013 Target data breach. Findings EBP approaches to cybercrime can improve the effectiveness of existing and future approaches to cybercrime training, recruitment, as well as officers' preparedness and awareness of cybercrime. Research limitations/implications - Future research will benefit from determining what types of training work at the local, state/provincial, and federal level, as well as evaluating both current and new cybercrime policing programs and strategies. Practical implications - EBP approaches to cybercrime have the potential to improve police responses to cybercrime calls for service, save police resources, improve police-public relations during calls for service, and improve police legitimacy. Originality/value This paper links cybercrime policing to the paradigm of EBP, highlighting the need for evaluating and implementing effective evidence-based approaches to policing cybercrime."
"Public cloud users interact online or offline using natural language. While the language used could be in Xhosa, English, Afrikaans, Zulu or Ndebele, the core component is communication. Therefore, natural language is the language that people speak, listen to and understand. This is the same language that a public cloud user, uses to interact with another human and/or machine components of the public cloud. Meanwhile the same natural language is sometimes used by cybercrime attackers to achieve their aims when targeting users of the public cloud. The targeting of the users could be attributed to the user's basic knowledge of the public cloud when seeking information or relationship formation, thereby unintentionally revealing points of vulnerabilities that often expose them to cybercrime attacks. A challenge to traditional digital forensic processes in the public cloud environment is the inability to retrieve an inactive cloud instance due to its volatile nature. Because of the variety of cybercrime attacks which are based on natural language, this research has developed a taxonomy for cybercrime attacks in the public cloud that is based on natural language. The taxonomy identifies the various cybercrime attacks which are derived from scholarly literature and the attack approaches are grouped as follows; (i) Non-technical induced cybercrime attack approach, (ii) Technical induced cybercrime attack approach, and (iii) Hybrid cybercrime attack approach. The research finds that the non-technical induced cybercrime attacks accounts for 61% of the cybercrime attacks in the public cloud, thus comprising the largest of the three groups. Due to the inadequacy of traditional digital forensic processes to deal with the challenges posed by cybercrime in the public cloud, this research concludes with the proposal of a high level model for digital forensic readiness for the public cloud."
Cybercrime may destabilise organisations and society due to the social, financial, emotional, psychological, and physical impacts. The purpose of this paper was to investigate cybercrime reporting behaviour and the factors that influence it. South African state-owned entities were the focus of attention given their strategic role, which requires that attention be given to improving their cybersecurity practices, such as cybercrime reporting in an increasingly digital society. The conceptual framework was developed using themes from the cybercrime literature, and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as a lens. The study used a quantitative method, and data was collected online using a questionnaire survey. One hundred and three complete responses were received from employees working in South African state-owned entities. Factors that were identified as influencing cybercrime reporting behaviour were self-efficacy and facilitating conditions.
We know surprisingly little about the prevalence and severity of cybercrime in the U.S. Yet, in order to prioritize the development and distribution of advice and technology to protect end users, we require empirical evidence regarding cybercrime. Measuring crime, including cybercrime, is a challenging problem that relies on a combination of direct crime reports to the government - which have known issues of under-reporting - and assessment via carefullydesigned self-report surveys. We report on the first large-scale, nationally representative academic survey (n=11,953) of consumer cybercrime experiences in the U.S. Our analysis answers four research questions: (1) What is the prevalence and (2) the monetary impact of these cybercrimes we measure in the U.S.?, (3) Do inequities exist in victimization?, and (4) Can we improve cybercrime measurement by leveraging social-reporting techniques used to measure physical crime? Our analysis also offers insight toward improving future measurement of cybercrime and protecting users.
The threat of cybercrime is becoming increasingly complex and diverse on putting citizen's data or money in danger. Cybercrime threats are often originating from trusted, malicious, or negligent insiders, who have excessive access privileges to sensitive data. The analysis of cybercrime insider investigation presents many opportunities for actionable intelligence on improving the quality and value of digital evidence. There are several advantages of applying Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) methods in cybercrime insider investigation. This paper introduces DPI method that can help investigators in developing new techniques and performing digital investigation process in forensically sound and timely fashion manner. This paper provides a survey of the packet inspection, which can be applied to cybercrime insider investigation.
"Many activities related to cybercrime operations do not require much secrecy, such as developing websites or translating texts. This research provides indications that many users of a popular public internet marketing forum have connections to cybercrime. It does so by investigating the involvement in cybercrime of a population of users interested in internet marketing, both at a micro and macro scale. The research starts with a case study of three users confirmed to be involved in cybercrime and their use of the public forum. It provides a first glimpse that some business with cybercrime connections is being conducted in the clear. The study then pans out to investigate the forum population's ties with cybercrime by finding crossover users, that is, users from the public forum who also comment on cybercrime forums. The cybercrime forums on which they discuss are analyzed and the crossover users' strength of participation is reported. Also, to assess if they represent a sub-group of the forum population, their posting behavior on the public forum is compared with that of non-crossover users. This blend of analyses shows that (i) a minimum of 7.2% of the public forum population are crossover users that have ties with cybercrime forums; (ii) their participation in cybercrime forums is limited; and (iii) their posting behavior is relatively indistinguishable from that of non-crossover users. This is the first study to formally quantify how users of an internet marketing public forum, a space for informal exchanges, have ties to cybercrime activities. We conclude that crossover users are a substantial part of the population in the public forum, and even though they have thus far been overlooked, their aggregate effect in the ecosystem must be considered. This study opens new research questions on cybercrime participation that should consider online spaces beyond their cybercrime branding."
This paper outlines the main risks associated with various types of hacker activities, analyzes the main trends in the development of the Russian cybercrime market, estimates the shares and the financial performance of the Russian segment of the global cybercrime market, and forecasts market trends for 2012.
This work introduces the special edited issue on the human factor in cybercrime research.
Criminal computer data legislation in Ireland dates to 1991, however its next iteration was not until 2017. Its implementation is still in its infancy and needs an effective, consistent constitutional framework to ensure accountability and action. Irish legislation is important for monitoring 30% ofEU data but is limited in its belated modermSation. Therefore, it is important for personal, criminal, and national security defining cybercrime legislation to review current Irish legislation of technology related crimes. Statistics alone cannot interpret legislative efficacy, and therefore qualitative understanding the experiences of digital security practitioners whose professions are directed by relevant legislation could produce beneficial insights. This research analysed interviews with seventeen digital security experts about their professional experiences and opinions relating to cybercrime legislation. Primary emergent themes were identified as: Awareness and prioritisation, jurisdiction and reporting limits, technological advances and the legislative sprawl of dealing with cybercrime today. This research contributes to Irish legal understandings of cybercrime regulation and technology use today and suggests how to address legislative developments in the future, based on the experiences of an expert security panel.
On 19 August 2011, the ECOWAS Council of Ministers adopted Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime at its Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session in Abuja, Nigeria. The adoption of the Directive at that time arose from the need to tackle the growing trend in cybercrime within the ECOWAS region, as some Member States were already gaining global notoriety as major sources of email scams and Internet fraud. Accordingly, the Directive established a legal framework for the control of cybercrime within the ECOWAS region, and also imposed obligations on Member States to establish the necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative measures to tackle cybercrime. In particular, the Directive required Member States to implement those obligations not later than 1st January, 2014. This article undertakes an inquiry into the legal status of the Directive as an ECOWAS regional instrument in the domestic legal systems of Member States. In this regard, the article examines whether the requirement regarding the superiority or direct applicability of ECOWAS Community laws such as ECOWAS Acts and Regulations in the domestic legal systems of Member States also apply to ECOWAS Directives such as the Cybercrime Directive. The article also examines the legal implications of the Directive's obligations for Member States. The article argues that while some Member States have not implemented the obligations under the Directive, that those obligations however provide a legal basis for holding Member States accountable, where the failure to implement has encouraged the perpetration of cybercrime that infringed fundamental rights guaranteed under human right instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights or under their national laws.

Even though the dark number is especially high for cybercrimes, it is unclear by whom and to whom cybercrime is reported. Therefore, this study will answer the following questions: (1) who reports cybercrime incidents, and (2) to whom do victims report cybercrime? Analyses based on survey data including 334 recent cybercrime victims, indicate that 73.4% of victims do not report the incident. Cybercrime victims who do report are significantly older. In addition, 40.4% of the reporting victims notified the police, while others contacted a wide diversity of organizations. Based on these results, awareness raising campaigns should especially encourage young victims to report cybercrime incidents to the police. It would moreover be useful to appoint and promote a more centralized reporting channel.
Cybercrime and the threat it creates are growing in its reach, in accordance with similar growth in information technology. Some countries account for more of the variation in cybercrime activity than others, which affects less criminally involved nations as well, considering that cybercrime does not respect national borders over the Internet. Routine activity theory (RAT) has been used to explain cybercrime at the individual level, but not at the national level. Much research has focused on high cybercrime countries, but this research is often conducted by cybersecurity firms and is exclusively descriptive, making no inferences. This research sought to determine what characteristics predict whether a nation is high in either spamming activity or phishing activity. In a sample of 132 countries, it was found that wealthier nations with more Internet users per capita had higher cybercrime activity. Unemployment was also found to interact with Internet users such that the effect of the proportion of Internet users on spam was strongest in nations with higher unemployment. The implications these findings have for policy and suggestions for future research are discussed.
Compared to other topics, cybercrime is a relatively new addition to the criminological literature. Interest in the topic has grown over the past decade, with a Iran, of scholars leading efforts to generate empirical understanding about the topic. Common conclusions reached in these studies are that more research is needed, cybercrime is interdisciplinary in nature, and cybercrime should be addressed as an international problem. In this study, we examine a sample of 593 prior cybercrime scholarly articles to identify the types of research strategies used in them, the patterns guiding those strategies, whether the research is interdisciplinary, and the degree to which scholars engage in international cybercrime studies. Attention is also given to co-authorship as well citation patterns. Implications for future research are provided.
Purpose of ReviewSince the pandemic, the daily activities of many people occur at home. People connect to the Internet for work, school, shopping, entertainment, and doctor visits, including psychiatrists. Concurrently, cybercrime has surged worldwide. This narrative review examines the changing use of technology, societal impacts of the pandemic, how cybercrime is evolving, individual vulnerabilities to cybercrime, and special concerns for those with mental illness.Recent FindingsHuman factors are a central component of cybersecurity as individual behaviors, personality traits, online activities, and attitudes to technology impact vulnerability. Mental illness may increase vulnerability to cybercrime. The risks of cybercrime should be recognized as victims experience long-term psychological and financial consequences. Patients with mental illness may not be aware of the dangers of cybercrime, of risky online behaviors, or the measures to mitigate risk.SummaryTechnology provides powerful tools for psychiatry but technology must be used with the appropriate safety measures. Psychiatrists should be aware of the potential aftermath of cybercrime on mental health, and the increased patient risk since the pandemic, including from online mental health services. As a first step to increase patient awareness of cybercrime, psychiatrists should provide a recommended list of trusted sources that educate consumers on cybersecurity.
Cybercrime is not only a social ill but it does also pose a tremendous threat to our virtual world of personal, corporate and national data security. The recent global cyberattack of WannaCry ransomware has created an adverse effect on worldwide financials, healthcare and educational sectors, highlighting the poor state of cyber security and its failure. This growing class of cyber attackers is gradually becoming one of the fundamental security concerns that require immediate attention of security researchers. This paper explores why the volume and severity of cyberattacks are far exceeding with the capabilities of their mitigation techniques and how the preventive safety measures could reduce the losses from cybercrime for such type of attacks in future. It further expresses the need to have a better technological vision and stronger defenses, to change the picture where human cognition might be the next big weapon as a security assurance toolkit.
This paper argues the need for considering mitigating circumstances in cybercrime. Mitigating circumstances are conditions which moderate the culpability of an offender of a committed offence. Our argument is based on several observations. The cyberspace introduces a new family of communication and interaction styles and designs which could facilitate, make available, deceive, and in some cases persuade, a user to commit an offence. User's lack of awareness could be a valid mitigation when using software features introduced without a proper management of change and enough precautionary mechanisms, e.g. warning messages. The cyber behaviour of users may not be necessarily a reflection of their real character and intention. Their irrational and unconscious actions may result from their immersed and prolonged presence in a particular cyber context. Hence, the consideration of the cyberspace design, the cyber psychological status of an offender and their inter-relation could form a new family of mitigating circumstances inherent and unique to cybercrime. This paper elaborates on this initial argument from different perspectives including software engineering, cyber psychology, digital forensics, social responsibility and law.
Cybercrime is a growing threat to organizations and individuals worldwide, with criminals using sophisticated techniques to breach security systems and steal sensitive data. This paper aims to comprehensively survey the latest advancements in cybercrime prediction, highlighting the relevant research. For this purpose, we reviewed more than 150 research articles and discussed 50 most recent and appropriate ones. We start the review with some standard methods cybercriminals use and then focus on the latest machine and deep learning techniques, which detect anomalous behavior and identify potential threats. We also discuss transfer learning, which allows models trained on one dataset to be adapted for use on another dataset. We then focus on active and reinforcement learning as part of early-stage algorithmic research in cybercrime prediction. Finally, we discuss critical innovations, research gaps, and future research opportunities in Cybercrime prediction. This paper presents a holistic view of cutting-edge developments and publicly available datasets.
Reports of cybercrime being committed by people on the autism spectrum often imply that autism may be more prevalent among cybercriminals than the general population, although this remains unproven. In an online survey of 302 participants, we found that autistic individuals (n = 25) were more likely to report engagement in cybercrime than non-autistic individuals, but this relationship was not mediated by advanced digital skills or deficits in theory of mind. Furthermore, independent of autism diagnosis, autistic traits were not significantly associated with self-reported cyber-criminality. We propose that there may be additional factors moderating the relationship between autism, autistic traits, and cybercrime, such as specific autistic characteristics, understanding of cybercrime, and willingness to disclose criminal activity.
Today's cybercrimes are much more difficult to detect and prosecute than traditional crimes. In the investigation of cybercrimes, law enforcement agencies follow similar techniques to traditional crimes that, however, have to be modified to meet the unique conditions and requirements of virtual space. This paper examines cybercrime profiling techniques prevalent today, and focuses on the feasibility of applying geographic profiling technique to cyber offenders. The primary assumption of the research is that for most types of cybercrime, the steps during the procedure of committing criminal act are not random. For example, the choice of the victim, the choice of crime location, similar characteristics, follow a certain logic, which could provide information about the offender's crime. Testing the utility of a geographical profiling has been carried out on real cybercrime samples obtained by law enforcement agencies. This paper aims to apply the concept of geographic profiling to the issue of cybercrime that involve a physical world, targeting two types of cybercrimes: credit card skimming and spear phishing. Specially developed GeoCrime geographic profiling software designed to assist in the mapping, spatial and statistical analysis of cybercrime patterns was used. The results of the study have shown the possibility of applying geographic profiling to certain types of cybercrimes and under the certain conditions. The importance of geographic profiling is also emphasized, especially in situations where little is known about the offender, such as in cybercrime, where offenders use the Internet to hide their identities and activities.

This volume highlights the central role of the human factor in cybercrime and the need to develop a more interdisciplinary research agenda to understand better the constant evolution of online harms and craft more effective responses. The term human factor is understood very broadly and encompasses individual, institutional, and societal dimensions. It covers individual human behaviors and the social structures that enable collective action by groups and communities of various sizes, as well as the different types of institutional assemblages that shape societal responses. This volume is organized around three general themes whose complementary perspectives allow us to map the complex interplay between offenders, machines, and victims, moving beyond static typologies to offer a more dynamic analysis of the cybercrime ecology and its underlying behaviors. The contributions use quantitative and qualitative methodologies and bring together researchers from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, and Canada.
Understanding the sequences of processes needed to perform a cybercrime is crucial for effective interventions. However, generating these supply chains currently requires time-consuming manual effort. We propose a method that leverages machine learning and graph-based analysis to efficiently extract supply chains from cybercrime forums. Our supply chain detection algorithm can identify 33% and 42% relevant chains within major English and Russian forums, respectively, showing improvements over the baselines of 11% and 5%, respectively. Our analysis of the supply chains demonstrates underlying connections between products and services that are potentially useful understanding and undermining the illicit activity of these forums. For example, our extracted supply chains illuminate cash out and money laundering techniques and their importance to the functioning of these forums.
The Convention of Cybercrime is the first international instrument in preventing and combating cybercrime. Over time, some concerns were expressed whereby this Convention would be overcome by the (unprecedented) development of technology, given the date of opening for signature (23 November 2011). In this context, the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) decided, at its 8th Plenary (December 2012), to issue guidance notes, which represents the common understanding of the Parties on the use of the Convention and are intended at facilitating the effective use and implementation of this Convention, also in the light of technological progress and the legal and political as well.
The prevalence of cybercrime has increased rapidly over the last decades and has become part of the everyday life of citizens. It is, therefore, of great importance to gain more knowledge on the factors related to an increased or decreased likelihood of becoming a cybercrime victim. The current study adds to the existing body of knowledge using a large representative sample of Dutch individuals (N= 3,648) to study the relationship between cybercrime victimization and the key traits from the Big Five model of personality (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience). First, multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between the personality traits and three victim groups, that is, cybercrime victims versus nonvictims, traditional crime victims versus nonvictims, and cybercrime victims versus traditional crime victims. Next, logistic regression analyses were performed to predict victimization of cyber-dependent crimes (i.e., hacking and virus infection) and cyber-enabled crimes (i.e., online intimidation, online consumer fraud, and theft from bank account). The analyses show that personality traits are not specifically associated with cybercrime victimization, but rather with victimization in general. Only those with higher scores on emotional stability were less likely to become a victim of cybercrime than traditional crime. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are little differences between personality traits related to victimization of cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crimes. Only individuals with higher scores on openness to experience have higher odds of becoming a victim of cyber-enabled crimes.
The Internet and related technology development have increased cybercrime perpetration and victimization opportunities. Individuals who have experienced victimization in the past are fearful of cybercrime. Yet, despite the increase in diversified cybercrime, previous studies have used inaccurate, aggregated measures of victimization and fear. This study uses domain-specific cybercrime victimization and fear measures to clarify the relationships between the two. We further investigate how the level of informed risk of cybercrime, which is fundamental to creating effective policies for combating cybercrime, moderates such associations. Utilizing the 2019 Eurobarometer (N = 20,400, country N = 28), we conducted a separate analysis for each of the 10 types of cybercrime. As expected, a multilevel regression analysis revealed that victims are more likely to fear a type of cybercrime that they have experienced before. More interestingly, such associations are statistically significant for specific types of cybercrime depending on the level of informed risk. Based on these findings, we discuss policy implications for developing and revising campaigns and educational programs for cybercrime victims and the general public and increasing international institutional cooperation.
"This research work is to bring to light, the danger posed by Cyber Crime in the world generally and Nigeria in particular with the hope that policy makers will work with the recommendations and practical combating framework design of this research work. In order to achieve this, the following approaches were adopted; survey of some common Cybercrime in Nigeria with the frequency of occurrence and design of a frame work system to combat the crime. The system design controls and track cyber criminals on the Nigerian cyber space. The paper proposes the establishment of National Cybercrime Control Center ( NCCC) to effect this system. The Security Agents could obtain tracked information from NCCC as evidence to arrest and prosecute cybercriminals."
We recently rejected the hypothesis that increases in cybercrime may have caused the international crime drop. Critics subsequently argued that offenders switched from physical crime to cybercrime in recent years, and that lifestyle changes due to 'leisure IT' may have caused the international crime drop. Here we explain how the critics misrepresented our argument and do not appear to introduce anything new.
While the internet has had a profound effect on all aspects of modern living, its use does make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being targeted by cybercriminals. Cybercrime rates have been found to increase year-on-year, and the consequences include financial and reputational damage, loss of privacy and breaches of intellectual property. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become a major target for cybercriminals due to its high levels of economic activity and tourism, significant uptake of technology, and the rise of the oil and gas industry. The UAE Government has introduced changes to its single cybercrime law, but there are concerns that it is not suitably comprehensive to provide adequate protections of UAE citizens and residents. This article reviews the protections provided by the law through interview results, and comparisons to other, similar laws internationally. It then offers recommendations on how the law can be improved, to make people feel safer in their usage of the internet and internet-connected technologies.
Currently, along with the maturity and widespread of computer technology and Internet, cybercrime are worsening. Therefore, it not only brings harm to the society, but also brings problems to traditional forensics. So it is very important for the university to develop a related course and train students to deal with information crime and computer forensics. East China University of Politics and Law has set up a college course named cybercrime and computer forensics for undergraduate students for six years and done some researches. Both of them get great achievements.
In recent years there has been an increase in cybercrimes and its negative impacts on the lives of individuals, organizations, and governments. It has been argued that a better understanding of cybercrime is a necessary condition to develop appropriate legal and policy responses to cybercrime. While a universally agreed-upon classification scheme would facilitate the development of such understanding and also collaborations, current classification schemes are insufficient, fragmented and often incompatible since each focuses on different perspectives (e.g., role of the computer, attack, attacker's or defender's viewpoint), or uses varying terminologies to refer to the same thing, making consistent cybercrime classifications improbable. In this paper we present and illustrate a new cybercrime ontology that incorporates multiple perspectives and offers a more holistic viewpoint for cybercrime classification than prior works. It should therefore prove to be a more useful tool for cybercrime stakeholders.
This article discusses the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies when investigating cybercrime. The article presents the technical investigation roles necessary for cybercrime policing in a resource capability matrix. Adopting a standard resource capability framework across the wider law enforcement community will assist in the development of common policies and procedures, and will maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of cybercrime investigation in a shrinking global economy.
The article examines the history of the emergence and development of cybercrime, the specifics of the current situation in society, which contributes to an increase in the number of cybercrimes and ways of countering cybercrime. It has been established that cybercrime first appeared in the middle of the last century. This was due to the emergence and subsequent intensive growth in the number of computers, and then smartphones. However, cybercrime that exists today is significantly different from what it was in its early days. Today, the number of devices and services provided via the Internet is growing, the number of users is growing, and, accordingly, the number of cybercrimes and the level of their organization is growing. In the course of the study, the differences between the concepts of cybercrime and computer crimes were identified, as well as the main features of cybercrimes. The problems that law enforcement agencies face in the investigation and fight against cybercrimes were revealed. The factors contributing to the growth of cybercrime were also analyzed. Based on the analysis, the main directions of combating cybercrime and preventing the growth of the number of cybercrimes in society were developed.
This study investigated the emerging trend in cyber dynamics among youths using statistical tools. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The population of the study comprised all cybercriminals in police custody in Ibadan, Nigeria. A simple random sampling procedure was used to select four hundred and eighteen participants for the study. The results of the analysis revealed that there was a significant and positive relationship between social influence and the prevalence of cybercrime among youth in the study area, there was a significant and positive relationship between economic influence and prevalence of cybercrime among youth in Africa, there was a significant and negative relationship between political influence and prevalence of cybercrime among youth in Africa and there was a significant and negative relationship between religious influence and prevalence of cybercrime among youth in Africa. Based on the findings of the study, the conclusion was reached that data mining and machine learning have a direct pattern on the prevalence of cybercrime and associated factors. The recommendation was made that authority in charge of cybercrime should ensure that data are available in the database for easy accessibility and quality conclusion on the causes of the prevalence of cybercrime among Nigeria youth.
On 5 November 2010 within the framework of the Fifth International Conference on Legal, Security and Privacy Issues in IT Law (LSPI) and associated conference series a Closing Workshop was held at the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC) to review and address the main challenges of Cybercrime. The event complemented the CLSR 150th Anniversary Seminar on Digital Identity held the previous evening at the Barcelona office of law firm Roca Juyent. The Workshop was supported by the Computer Forensics Laboratories CFLabs and by CLSR. Copies of the journal were distributed via a booth at the event to enable relevant papers published in the journal to be accessed during the workshop event. The Cybercrime Workshop provided an opportunity for academics, practitioners and consultants from different backgrounds and nationalities to come together and exchange ideas to discuss significant developments in Cybercrime and emerging issues on IT security.

The activities of enterprise employees can become a risk factor in terms of cybercrime, which is often associated with their lack of preparedness to counter potential cyber threats. Many businesses need a well-adjusted system of approaches to protect their internal data from all sorts of cyber threats. The objectives of the study are to analyze the practices of using systems to combat cybercrime phenomena in the corporate sphere. This analysis includes a review of the use of preventive measures by the personnel of top high-tech companies such as Apple and Samsung. The research implies to study the regulatory component of corporate systems for preventing cybercrime among personnel in the context of existing practices and approaches to the legal regulation of this issue. The study examines the relationship of corporate instructions in the field of cybersecurity. The results of the study indicate that the regulatory basis of countering internal cybercrime and data breach issues, as well as practical measures for its implementation cannot be equated, since the latter may have the nature of informal measures and do not contain formal reporting.
Since its innovation, the Internet had led to increased vulnerability, and Cybercrime has been a serious global problem that needs a strong technical and legal response. This paper examines the trend and the challenges of these crime in cyberspace and attempts to provide some suggestions on cybercrime governance in the era of big data. It reveals that the combination of social and government data under the guidance of sound laws and regulations will provide a powerful resolution.
Anti-cybercrime service with data-intensive has become one of the most challenging research issues. A comprehensive solution is required to overcome the problems of anti-cybercrime service performance and scalability in dealing with large scale information. We propose service enthalpy, a new approach in atomizing anti-cybercrime service to tackle large scale information with the use of a measure to ease the creation and collaboration of services. Service enthalpy comprises performance improvement, data intensification, functionality simplification, analysis shallowing, data uniformization, and revelation. We evaluated these six enthalpies to meet several objectives. The result shows that an approximated objective can be achieved.
This study aims to propose a system of indicators for dividing financial cybercrime into groups. The results of this study indicate absence of taxonomic indicators regarding clustering of financial cybercrimes and wide differences in approaches to the development of such indicators in relation to cybercrimes. The proposed system of indicators for clustering of financial cybercrime is designed to help create a unified, consistent and holistic classification of cybercrime. The results of the study can be applied in the criminal legal classification of unlawful acts corresponding to the general concept of financial cybercrime.
Underground forums allow criminals to interact, exchange knowledge, and trade in products and services. They also provide a pathway into cybercrime, tempting the curious to join those already motivated to obtain easy money. Analysing these forums enables us to better understand the behaviours of offenders and pathways into crime. Prior research has been valuable, but limited by a reliance on datasets that are incomplete or outdated. More complete data, going back many years, allows for comprehensive research into the evolution of forums and their users. We describe CrimeBot, a crawler designed around the particular challenges of capturing data from underground forums. CrimeBot is used to update and maintain CrimeBB, a dataset of more than 48m posts made from 1m accounts in 4 different operational forums over a decade. This dataset presents a new opportunity for large-scale and longitudinal analysis using up-to-date information. We illustrate the potential by presenting a case study using CrimeBB, which analyses which activities lead new actors into engagement with cybercrime. CrimeBB is available to other academic researchers under a legal agreement, designed to prevent misuse and provide safeguards for ethical research.
"Cloud computing has emerged to be the most effective headway for investigating crime especially cybercrime in this modern world. Even as we move towards an information technology-controlled world, it is important to note that when innovations are made, some negative implications also come with it, and an example of this is these criminal activities that involve technology, network devices, and networking that have emerged as a result of web improvements. These criminal activities are the ones that have been termed cybercrime. It is because of these increased criminal activities that organizations have come up with different strategies that they use to counter these crimes, and one of them is carrying out investigations using the cloud environment. A cloud environment has been defined as the use of web-based applications that are used for software installation and data stored in computers. This paper examines problems that are a result of cybercrime investigation in the cloud environment. Through analysis of the two components in play; cybercrime and cloud environment, we will be able to understand what are the problems that are encountered when carrying out investigations in cloud forensics. Through the use of secondary research, this paper found out that most problems are associated with technical and legal channels that are involved in carrying out these investigations. Investigator's mistakes when extracting pieces of evidence form the most crucial problems that take a lead when it comes to cybercrime investigation in the cloud environment. This paper not only flags out the challenges that are associated with cybercrime investigation in cloud environments but also offer recommendations and suggested solutions that can be used to counter the problems in question here. Through a proposed model to perform forensics investigations, this paper discusses new methodologies solutions, and developments for performing cybercrime investigations in the cloud environment."
The Council of Europe's Budapest Convention on cybercrime (2001) remains a key landmark in multilateral governance on cybersecurity. Negotiated over two decades ago, this regional agreement gains renewed significance today through its enduring impact, its rarity as a binding multilateral agreement on cyber-issues, and its role in shaping the debate on free speech and the criminalization of online content. This article asks how the almost-total exclusion of content crimes from the Convention can be explained. Drawing on new documents published for the twentieth anniversary of the Convention, including detailed testimonials from its chair and principal drafters, the article highlights the importance of long-term career connections among technically-savvy and diplomatically experienced negotiators, creating a transnational policy network that overcame differences and power imbalances. Understanding how the Budapest Convention resolved disagreements helps contextualize current crises in multilateral cybersecurity and cybercrime governance and provides a path away from growing digital authoritarianism.
With increasing access to information and communication technologies such as the Internet, Ethiopia has recently taken responsive legislative measures. One such legislative measure is enactment of cybercrime rules as part of the Criminal Code of 2004. These rules penalize three items of computer crimes namely hacking, dissemination of malware and denial of service attacks. The cybercrime rules are however slightly outdated due to changes that have occurred in the field of cybercrime since the enactment of the Code. The surge of new varieties of cybercrimes previously uncovered under the Code and the need to legislate tailored evidentiary and procedural rules for investigation and prosecution of cybercrimes have recently prompted the Ethiopian government to draft modern and comprehensive cybercrime legislation, but the draft law still needs further work on cybercrimes in light of other major legislative developments at regional and national levels. This article closely examines major developments in cybercrime law and practice in Ethiopia since the enactment of the first set of cybercrime rules and proffers recommendations towards a unified cybercrime regime.

This position paper proposes a previously neglected method for investigating cybercrime disruption: laboratory experiments. As a case study for the exploration of this method, it examines slander and Sybil operations against cybercriminal marketplaces. While there has been some scholarly discussion of these interventions, carrying out empirical work on the effectiveness of these tactics is challenging. This position paper reports on a feasibility pilot study, and the results should be viewed as suggestive, rather than conclusive. The paper's core value is in providing proof of concept for employing this methodology within cybercrime research, and offering insights for future studies of these, or other, disruption tactics.
The article is dedicated to the study of the measures used to combat cybercrime in different countries. It is observed that the world's leading countries are actively expanding and creating units in the armed forces and intelligence services that should ensure the development of offensive capabilities in cyberspace. In particular, the operational cooperation of law enforcement agencies, such as Interpol, Europol and Eurojust, in the fight against cybercrime is being stepped up. Anti-cybercrime activities are carried out not only by individual states, but also by their blocs, including NATO. In Ukraine, unlike the developed countries of the world, measures to combat cybercrime are less developed. Despite the existence of special laws and strategies, in particular the Cyber Security Strategy of Ukraine, the fight against cybercrime is not effective due to the declarative nature of most of the provisions of this strategy. It is concluded that one of the problematic aspects of the phenomenon of cybercrime is the low level of education in information technologies of the population of Ukraine.
The development of Internet network created new opportunities for offenders in the computer field to commit remote cybercrimes, their presence not being necessary in the place where the victim is. Starting from the cross-border character of cybercrimes, in this article is carried out an analysis of the main judicial instruments in the field of fight against cybercrime. Moreover, it is carried out an analysis of the Romanian legislation regarding international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime.
The evolution of information technology, information systems and has left its mark on all areas of social, economic, civil, military life, and the advantages of information technology are absolutely obvious, it decisively influencing the progress of humanity. Cybercrime includes, in addition to classic criminal acts (fraud, counterfeiting, prostitution, fraud) and acts specific to the cyber domain (software piracy, card theft or forgery of electronic payment instruments, network viruses, electronic terrorism, harassment by e-mail, etc.). Terms such as: computer related crimes, cybercrime, hightech crime are used to describe offenses committed through or against computer systems and communications networks. Information technology offers special possibilities for breaking the law in any field that uses cyber systems (financial banking, road traffic, air traffic, national security, military, medical, educational, social).
"Purpose - Little empirical research exists regarding how local law enforcement has responded to cybercrime. This paper aims to understand: the law enforcement agencies that line officers believe should be primarily responsible for investigating cybercrime cases; their perceptions about their agency's current ability to respond to these offenses; and their beliefs regarding the best ways to improve the social response to cybercrime. Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed patrol officers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan police departments. Findings - The authors found that officers do not believe that local law enforcement should be primarily responsible for handling cybercrime cases and they have little information on how upper management is addressing cybercrime. Officers indicated that the best strategies to deal with cybercrime were greater care taken by citizens online and improvements to the legal system. Research limitations/implications - Local law enforcement agencies feel they are unable to fully address cybercrime. Although the findings were generally consistent across demographic and experiential characteristics and cities, two cities in the southeastern United States were surveyed. Practical implications According to these officers, they want citizens to be more careful online and for clarification of cybercrime laws and increased prosecutions. They do not favor local cybercrime units and additional computer training for line officers as much as scholars and police administrators advocate. Originality/value - This paper studied the perceptions of patrol officers, who are the first responders to most crime scenes, on local law enforcement responses to cybercrime and the strategies they view to be most effective in combating cybercrime."
The rapid growth in the availability of information and communications technologies has also expanded opportunities to commit cybercrime. Law enforcement officers are often the first responders to such incidents. Internationally, research has revealed how police preparedness to respond to cybercrime is mediated by organizational policies and procedures, as well as characteristics such as education, gender, and previous training for cybercrime investigations. However, there has been limited research in an Australian context examining police preparedness to respond to cybercrime. As such, this article examines the preparedness of Australian police personnel to respond to cybercrime incidents drawing on surveys with two state-wide police agencies (n = 422). Here, we examine the prevalence of cybercrime training across both agencies, levels of individual and organizational confidence about responding to cybercrime incidents, and their views about enhancing responses to cybercrime. The results suggest only half of the surveyed personnel have received some cybercrime-related training, with significantly less reporting specific instruction about how to receive and direct incident reports and manage digital crime scenes. Further, while personnel are modestly confident in their individual capabilities to respond to cybercrime incidents, they lack comparative confidence in their organizations and yearn for more resourcing and professional development. Implications for police resourcing, training, and practices are discussed.
The supplementary dataset presented in this paper was used to measure the level of cybersecurity awareness of cybercrime in Saudi Arabia, presented in detail in [1]. The data were collected during the period of August to October of 2019. The dissemination process took place via an online questionnaire. The survey has four main parts: Personal and skill information (10 questions), Cybersecurity Activities (7 questions), Cybercrime Consciousness (8 questions), and Case Reports (6 questions). Two protocols were employed to recruit participants: subject must be of Saudi nationality and older than 18 years old. A combination of purposive and snowball techniques was utilized to collect respondents via university emails from 27 Saudi universities and WhatsApp messages to people meeting the requirements, gathering a total of 1230 responses. The data can be used to inform responsible authorities in Saudi Arabia about their roles in solving anticipated problems, as well as raising the awareness through programs, training, and short courses.

Reporting plays a vital role in combatting cybercrimes. The data collected from cybercrime reporting can not only bolster the efforts of those on the responding end of such attacks (i.e., government, law enforcement agencies, and the technology industry), but also provide relevant prevention tips to computer users to help mitigate their cybercrime risk. Despite the importance of cybercrime reporting, we observe that many cybercrimes go unreported, which arguably can be due to an overall lack of effectiveness of currently existing cybercrime reporting mechanisms. This study aims to streamline cybercrime reporting processes at PayPal by proposing a design of an interactive customer-facing cybercrime reporting interface. The overall goals of the proposed design are to (1) appropriately triage reports both within the company and to relevant external entities and (2) to educate the customer base about cybercrimes and cybercrime reporting through helpful links. The proposed design was tested with 523 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers and was considered user-friendly and informative by our participants. Moreover, a statistical model demonstrated that aside from our proposed interface's usability, users' victimization, self-efficacy, and perception of cybercrimes' severity all had a positive effect on the likelihood to report a cybercrime. Our proposed design and evaluation have the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cybercrime reporting to corporations and government/law enforcement agencies.
"In recent years a large proportion of cybercrime attacks are text-data based, whereby the cyberattack propagation method is non-technical. Though copious information about these attacks, mainly, the meta-data can be extracted, such information is usually unavailable for digital forensic (DF) investigation because these cyber-attacks are often unreported. One of the reasons for victim under-reporting of cybercrime is the lack of an anonymous system to report cybercrime, as well as the lack of digital forensic defined criteria for cybercrime reporting. The problem identified by this paper, therefore, is the lack of defined digital forensic criteria for reporting cybercrime attacks anonymously. A defined digital forensic (DF) criteria for cybercrime reporting is proposed to address this problem. The method employed is to firstly, develop a generic DF cybercrime reporting data collection system that uses a DF cybercrime incident criteria definition that is also privacy enhanced. Secondly, the creation of a natural language data preparation semantic builder that is integrated to store mapped semantics data used to create defined DF criteria for a cybercrime language database. Thirdly, the integrated database (DB) defined DF cybercrime semantic DB can be analysed to formulate a digital forensic readiness architecture for cybercrime language detection. The generated natural language (NL), semantic data of potential cybercrime language, could be developed as a plugin and APIs, pluggable to any DF investigations, tools and applications. The benefits of the proposed defined DF cybercrime reporting criteria include the following; (i) It is a medium for cybercrime victims to report a crime. (ii) The proposed system generates useful data for the implementation of digital forensic readiness architecture and planning that is re-usable and scalable to accommodate other forms of intrusion detection techniques and processes (iii) To design and develop cyber- attack reporting tools and techniques using the information provided by the victims, especially in a text-based cyber-attack. (iv) To provide research data for cybercrime data analytics using the gathered reported data. (v) The proposed criteria ensure that the victims of cybercrime could report cyber-attacks anonymously while maintaining privacy. The findings of this paper pave the way to develop a readily available, easily accessible and defined digital forensic criteria for cybercrime reporting."
"Purpose Police-reported incidents of cybercrime appear to vary dramatically across Canadian municipal police services. This paper explores cybercrime reporting by police services in eight of Canada's largest municipalities, assessing (1) variation over time; (2) variation across jurisdictions; and (3) correlates of reporting volumes. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from a combination of national Uniform Crime Report statistics and annual reports by police services. Two repeated one-way ANOVA tests and a Pearson's r correlation matrix were used to assess variation and correlation. Findings Findings suggest that police-reported cybercrime varies significantly across jurisdictions but not over time. Moreover, negative relationships were observed between police-reported cybercrime incidents per 100,000 residents and calls for service per 100,000, as well as number of sworn officers per 100,000. Originality/value This paper introduces previously unreported data about police-reported cybercrime incidents in Canada. Furthermore, it adds quantitative evidence to support previous qualitative studies on police responses to cybercrime."
Cybercrimes, or offenses enabled by technology, affect computer systems and people and prove difficult to pursue through traditional criminal justice strategies due to jurisdictional challenges and legal hurdles. As a result, corporations and industry have begun to play a role in mitigating various forms of cybercrime. This article examines what constitutes cybercrime and the successes and limitations of law enforcement in combatting these offenses. I present a detailed discussion of efforts by industry and regulatory bodies to deter cybercrime. Finally, I consider and discuss the risks and challenges that traditional criminal justice system operations face moving forward.
Despite the increasing prevalence of cybercrimes, there is limited understanding of the response strategies and protective (privacy, security) practices of individuals who have experienced at least one attempted or successful cybercrime incident. To address this gap, we conduct an online survey across an N = 605 sample from the UK, eliciting firsthand accounts of cybercrime experiences, actions taken in response to such incidents, as well as their level of engagement with security and privacy (SP) methods and technologies. We identify the occurrence of 8 distinct types of cybercrime and 9 corresponding response strategies amongst 319 cybercrime reports, encompassing IT and protective themes. We depict the association between the experience of cybercrime and the utilisation of response strategies through visual representation. In parallel with IT-related or protective SP theme response strategies, we find that the type of cybercrime experienced (e.g., malware) and the frequency of experiences (e.g., multiple cybercrimes or repeated experiences of the same cybercrime type) influence the engagement with SP technologies. This paper provides empirical insights into experiences of different types of cybercrimes, including their multiple occurrences, and (protective) actions. We also provide recommendations for research and practical implementation, emphasising the importance of addressing the specific needs of individuals who have experienced multiple or repeat cybercrimes. Our paper suggests the adoption of a de-responsibiling cyber-strategy that complements individual guardianship - while promoting infrastructure that caters to the diverse range of users.
The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime,(1) referred to as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, has been diffused globally, and is serving as a benchmark or a 'model law' for drafting national cybercrime legislation in many countries worldwide. This paper argues that, through the mechanism of 'state socialization' combined with incentives, e.g. assistance in building law enforcement capacity, the diffusion of the Budapest Convention has had a profound influence on the development of cybercrime legislation in a number of Pacific Island Countries (PICs).(2) Some PICs have expressed their great interest in acceding to the Convention and 'imported' several provisions from the Convention. This article, nevertheless, contends that these PICs do not seem to consider carefully whether the 'imported' law is applicable to their existing law enforcement capacity. It is evident that various do-mestic factors, such as lack of resources, have deterred the enforcement of cybercrime laws in these countries. As the result, although those PICs would have adequate cybercrime laws 'on the books', 'law in action' is still feeble. (c) 2020 Dr. Chat Le Nguyen and Dr. Wilfred Golman. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Video conferencing tool Zoom has boomed during this COVID pandemic situation. Although Zoom has been very useful for facilitating work-from-home and study-from-home arrangements, its misuse can result in cybercrime cases. The world has already seen the adverse effect of a Zoom-related cybercrime, Zoombombing. In this article, we discuss how Zoom can also be misused for launching real-time cybercrime, such as piracy and real-time pornography. The end-to-end encryption proposed to be used by Zoom can further complicate these cybercrime issues. The existing mechanisms may not be sufficient in dealing with these real-time issues. New mechanisms need to be found. This article is categorized under: Digital and Multimedia Science > Multimedia Forensics
Cybercrime is ubiquitous. People now inhabit a digital environment comprising permanent risk, exponential threats, and multiple virtual/physical harms, forming a global community of malefactors and the criminally exploited. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, through an archaeological lens, to characterize the new materiality of cybercrime (including its artefacts and architecture alongside digital/virtual manifestations). And second, to explore the potential for new perspectives on cybercrime borne out of this archaeological approach. In short: what is the archaeology of cybercrime and can new understandings emerge from an archaeological perspective? In undertaking this research we also challenge the long-held presumption that non-physical traces cannot be studied archaeologically. It is our contention that they can.
Cybercrime and cybercriminal activities continue to impact communities as the steady growth of electronic information systems enables more online business. The collective views of sixty-six computer users and organizations, that have an exposure to cybercrime, were analyzed using concept analysis and mapping techniques in order to identify the major issues and areas of concern, and provide useful advice. The findings of the study show that a range of computing stakeholders have genuine concerns about the frequency of information security breaches and malware incursions (including the emergence of dangerous security and detection avoiding malware), the need for e-security awareness and education, the roles played by law and law enforcement, and the installation of current security software and systems. While not necessarily criminal in nature, some stakeholders also expressed deep concerns over the use of computers for cyberbullying, particularly where younger and school aged users are involved. The government's future directions and recommendations for the technical and administrative management of cybercriminal activity were generally observed to be consistent with stakeholder concerns, with some users also taking practical steps to reduce cybercrime risks.

A number of problems that really threaten the investigation of cybercrime in modern conditions are analyzed. The most common types of opposition to the investigation of such crimes by law enforcement agencies, which are manifested in various types and forms, are described. The need to overcome opposition to the investigation of cybercrimes is argued. The main directions of the fight against overcoming the investigation of cybercrime and illegal activities of stakeholders, which is aimed at concealing the detection of crimes and their investigation, are considered. The issue of the quality of cybercrime investigation in Ukraine by analyzing the legal framework for the quality of regulation of legal relations in this area is considered, the list of methods and means used to form the evidence base is outlined.
Various studies have shown that convicted offenders often face difficulties in finding employment. These studies, however, only examined traditional types of crime and little is known about the job opportunities of convicted cybercrime offenders. Therefore, this study examines the influences of being convicted for a cybercrime on labour market chances in the IT sector in the Netherlands. An experiment was conducted in which fictitious job applications were sent to existing job openings between March and June 2021 (N = 300), varying for type of crime (cybercrime, property crime, no offence) and ethnic background (Dutch or Turkish). In order to test the hypotheses, logistic regression analyses were carried out to test whether differences in responses were significant. No significant differences in positive responses were found between cybercrime offenders and non-offenders, implying that cybercrime offenders do not have less labour market opportunities. Moreover, significant differences were found between Dutch and Turkish applicants. The results of this study indicate that results from previous studies on job opportunities of traditional offenders are not generalisable to cybercrime offenders. Possibly, a cybercrime record gives a positive signal of IT-skills that are useful for employees, while a criminal record for a property crime is associated with negative characteristics.
This study investigates the relationships between users' routine activities and socio-economic characteristics and three forms of cybercrime victimization of 1) online shopping fraud, 2) online banking fraud and 3) cyber-attacks(i.e. DDoS attacks). Data from the Eurobarometer, containing a sample of 17,811 online European citizens was analyzed. The results generally support the Routine Activities Theory. There were few differences by sex. Younger respondents were more at risk of online purchase fraud, but older respondents more of online banking fraud. Few economic characteristics were related to victimization. The three forms of victimization were interrelated relatively strongly. The characteristic of victims of online crime differ from those of traditional crime. We propose that digitalization leads to a 'normalization of victims' of cybercrime.
An important portion of internet users have faced cybercrime in recent years. One successful strategy for dealing with cybercrime victimization is to seek social support. However, previous studies showed that only a limited number of victims reaches out to family or friends to ask for help after a cybercrime incident. The current study sought to gain a better understanding of victims' social support seeking by exploring its antecedents. Specifically, the study took into account the role of (1) perception (i.e., perceived severity and perceived control), (2) primary responses (i.e., self-blame and denial), and (3) social capital (i.e., available [trusted] connections). Moreover, we explored the link between fear of cybercrime and these antecedents. Data collected from 334 cybercrime victims were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings indicated that victims with high perceived control and who ignore the incident, are less inclined to ask for help. Surprisingly, victims with high levels of self-blame are more likely to seek support. Moreover, we found that fear of crime is significantly related with perception and self-blame. Future awareness campaigns should stress that support seeking is part of the solution and should avoid placing the responsibility of victimization completely on the victim.
"In this concluding chapter, we consolidate the broad spectrum of challenges discussed throughout this book towards the formulation of a number key priority topics to be addressed by future research related to cybercrime and cyberterrorism. During this process many of the specific areas that need to be addressed are defined across four inter-linked dimensions; technological, regulatory, organisational and human. In the process of identifying the nature of the challenges posed, the scope of the research and initiatives needed in order to progress measures targeting them, as well as the required impacts needed in order to ensure the significance of those initiatives. Initial sections of the chapter recapture, from a definitional perspective, the definitions of cybercrime and its constituent elements towards establishing a harmonised taxonomy of terms that we can use to inform the future work being proposed."
This paper reviews some massive cyber-attacks in Ukraine. It demonstrates the scale and dynamics of cybercrime in Ukraine. Motivated by cybercrime we develop a two-player two-strategy matrix game between a defender that can either protect its strategic asset or leave it unprotected, and a defender that can either attack the defender's asset, or not. We assume that defending and attacking strategies are costly, and the value of the strategic asset is higher than are the costs of defending /attacking it. We show that under generic conditions on parameters the game has a single mixed Nash equilibrium. At this equilibrium the probability that the attacker will attack decreases with the value of the asset while the probability that the defender will actively defend increases.
With the advancement of technology and the growth of the internet and cyber, many negative factors, such as cyberattacks and cybercrime, are on the rise and hinder the internet's and technology's positive use. Cybercrime is one of the worst factors significantly increasing in Indonesia today. Cybercrime is a criminal act that is prohibited in every country on the planet. The instances of cybercrime have harmed Indonesian computer users. The present study evaluates the legal frameworks and articles designed to control cybercrime issues within the Indonesian public administration. This study utilized a qualitative descriptive approach, along with an empirical judicial technique and statute approach analysis method. Documents about articles and legal frameworks in Indonesia were analyzed for data collection. The types and patterns of Cybercrime in Indonesia are outlined in Articles 27 to 35 of Law No. 11/2008. Chapter XI of Act No. 11/2008 describes the forms and patterns of violation of confidentiality and privacy. Based on the findings and discussion of the legal framework and analysis, recommendations are made to promote preventive measures, increase accountability, and reduce the communication divide between the government and Cybercrime-authoritative agencies. Along with the research limitations discussed in the study, the study has numerous theoretical and practical implications.
Analysis findings in the field of cybercrime in the world and Ukraine as well prove a steady trend towards its growth, which causes a systematic increase in the number of victims affected by illegal malpractice of cyber criminals. This negative phenomenon violates not only citizens' interests guaranteed by law, but also poses a threat to the national security in many countries. At the same time, international order is undermined and sustainable interstate relations are violated. Rapid information system development, speedy progress of computer software and hardware prompt numerous crimes in this field. Cybercrimes are committed by trained persons with a high intelligence level and professional knowledge in the computer technology sphere. In accordance with foregoing the issue of law approximation and the procedure of identification and recording of the mentioned illegal activity is essential to eradicate cybercrime. Considering the fact that the category of proof is fundamental in the theory of criminal procedure, we build in general-theoretical approaches in the basics of the analysis of the procedure of cybercrimes identification and recording to the mentioned activity in general.
The recent severity and frequency of cybercrime has been dominated by a single theme - the COVID-19 pandemic. This research develops a multi-level influence model to explore how cybercriminals are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing situational factors, identifying victims, impersonating trusted sources, selecting attack methods, and employing social engineering techniques. The model extends upon prior work on influence techniques and emotional appeals that cybercriminals employ, by bringing into sharper focus the role of situational factors in COVID-19 related cybercrime attacks. Content and thematic analysis was conducted on 185 distinct COVID-19 cybercrime scam incident documents, including text, images, and photos, provided by a global online fraud and cybersecurity company tracking COVID-19 related cybercrime. The analysis reveals interesting patterns about the sheer breadth and diversity of COVID-19 related cybercrime and how these crimes are continually evolving in response to changing situational factors. It is hoped that these insights and recommendations for end-users and organisations can contribute to a safer digital world as we cope with many other pressing challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.
While criminality is digitizing, a theory-based understanding of the impact of cybercrime on victims is lacking. Therefore, this study addresses the psychological and financial impact of cybercrime on victims, applying the shattered assumptions theory (SAT) to predict that impact. A secondary analysis was performed on a representative data set of Dutch citizens (N = 33,702), exploring the psychological and financial impact for different groups of cybercrime victims. The results showed a higher negative impact on emotional well-being for victims of person-centered cybercrime, victims for whom the offender was an acquaintance, and victims whose financial loss was not compensated and a lower negative impact on emotional well-being for victims with a higher income. The study led to novel scientific insights and showed the applicability of the SAT for developing hypotheses about cybercrime victimization impact. In this study, most hypotheses had to be rejected, leading to the conclusion that more work has to be done to test the applicability of the SAT in the field of cybercrime. Furthermore, policy implications were identified considering the prioritization of and approach to specific cybercrimes, treatment of victims, and financial loss compensation.
PurposeThis study aims to explore the nature and impacts of cybercrime in the Zimbabwean retail sector and evaluate the effectiveness of the current measures to deal with cybercrime. Design/methodology/approachThis study adopted a mixed research design on a sample of 38 retail players in a small mining town, Bindura, who were selected using stratified random and purposive sampling techniques. Data were collected through a mainly closed-ended questionnaire and in-depth interview guide. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse quantitative data, whereas summative content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. FindingsVirus dissemination, hacking and card fraud were identified as the major forms of cybercrime prevalent in the retail sector. Additional security costs, loss of sensitive data and direct financial losses were found to be the major impacts posed by cybercrime on retail sector. It was also established that the current internal measures and policing efforts to fight cybercrime in the retail sector were ineffective. Originality/valueThis study provides context-specific information on the scourge of cybercrime in a developing third world country that has of late been characterised by a myriad of other socioeconomic challenges. Although similar studies have been conducted in other parts of the globe, there has been a dearth of literature on retail sector cybercrime in Zimbabwe. This study also interrogates the Zimbabwean retail sector's preparedness in dealing with this contemporary threat.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the reporting intentions of traditional and cybercrime victimization, and the role of procedural justice in explaining sources of variation. Design/methodology/approach Using Amazon's MTurk program for opt-in survey participation, 534 respondents across the USA considered ten victimization incidents and expressed their likelihood of reporting each incident to the police as well as their belief that the police would identify and arrest the offender. Findings As expected, reporting intentions increased with the seriousness of the incident for both traditional crime and cybercrime. However, reporting intentions were generally slightly higher for incidents that occurred in the physical world, as opposed to online. Likewise, beliefs that police could identify and arrest and offender were lower for cybercrime compared to traditional crime. Consistently, predictors of reporting to the police and belief in police effectiveness hinged heavily on procedural justice. Other predictors for these behaviors and beliefs are also discussed. Originality/value This study uniquely compares reporting intentions of potential victims of parallel victimizations occurring in-person and online, thus providing firm comparisons about reporting intentions and beliefs about police effectiveness in addressing traditional and cybercrime.
"Understanding the reasons and the pathways of people becoming involved in cybercrime has been an important topic for research within different disciplines. Studies have explored the pathways of skilled hackers into deviant behaviour with a focus on online gaming, however little research has been conducted around understanding risk perception of cybercrime. This study investigates both surface and dark web forums, focusing on a variety of topics from hacking to gaming. The aim of this study is to a) investigate the ways cybercrime is perceived among different members of underground forums; b) identify whether there is an emotional construct of cybercrime; and c) identify the level of knowledge around behaviours which are considered as cybercrime and are criminalised. The novelty of this study lies in the methodological approach taken to conduct qualitative and quantitative research on large text datasets. Our findings identified hacking as one of the main deviant behaviours. Our analysis shows a general optimistic bias influencing the perception of risk associated with cybercrime as well as a number of risk avoidance strategies."
"With the exponential growth of information communication technology (ICT), cybercrimes have grown equally, culminating in investigation, solving such crimes and prosecuting the criminals. This article presents a proposal for the education, training and certified qualification of Brazilian police officers in order to prepare them so that they can be as knowledgeable, reliable, efficient and effective as possible. The proposal presents two types of training and qualification: the first, police officers whose primary focus is not cybercrime per se, but who as first responders are likely to encounter ICT activities as part of their work in fighting cybercrime; and the second, police officers who are involved in cybercrime investigations but expected to be classified as specialists. The proposal places strong emphasis on practical hands-on exercises, crime-scene hypothetical laboratories scenarios, actual and mock case studies and workshops to highly skilled Brazilian police officers as world class investigators. To meet this target, the proposal includes an outline of the proposed syllabus and laboratory practical sessions for each level of training to evolve specialist investigators(1)."
A total of 20 known cases of cybercrime attacks on water utilities have been seen in five countries between 2000 and 2021, with a steady increase in their frequency. The actual number of cyberattacks is higher, with 40 recorded in the United States in 2014-15. It is chiefly driven by organized crime and hostile state actors, along with disgruntled former employees. Vulnerabilities occur because of utilities adopting supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems without appropriate cybersecurity measures along with staff who have properly trained to be aware of phishing attacks. Threats such as these highlight the need for water utilities to have a comprehensive risk management system in operation.
So far, most meta-analyses and reviews on juvenile crime risk factors focused on risk factors for traditional crimes. It is unknown, though, whether these risk factors are also relevant for the explanation of cybercrime perpetration. This meta-analytic review aimed to identify risk factors for cyberstalking, hacking, and sexting perpetrated by juveniles. A literature search yielded 48 articles (24 for cyberstalking, 15 for sexting, and 10 for hacking) that produced 903 effect sizes (306 for cyberstalking, 61 for sexting, and 536 for hacking). The results showed similarities, but also differences in risk factors for the three types of cybercrime. Overall, peer factors were found to be important for all three types (deviant peers for cyberstalking and hacking and peer pressure for sexting). Besides, for cyberstalking, previous online and offline perpetration and victimization were significant risk factors. Other small but significant effects for multiple cybercrime types were found for dark personality traits (for cyberstalking and sexting) and high computer preoccupation (for cyberstalking and hacking). Impli-cations for (preventive) intervention are discussed, as well as the need for future research.
Most cyberspace users fell victim to some cybercrime. This poster reports on a survey of students conducted to provide an overview of cybercrime victimization and related help-seeking behaviors. The results suggest that unwelcome private messages with sexual content or requests, infections with a virus, unauthorized access to online accounts, and offensive and hostile messages were most common cybercrimes. Respondents would most often turn to their friends, the police, and family members for help.
In this paper we question Farrell and Birks' assertion of the emergence of cybercrime as an invalid explanation for the crime drop. Alternatively to the cybercrime hypothesis, we propose two non-exclusive hypotheses that highlight the essential role of cyberspace as an environment that has shifted criminal opportunities from physical to virtual space, which reflects on crime trends. The first hypothesis posits that the more time spent at home by many young people due to video games and online leisure activities, among other factors, could have had an impact on the juvenile crime drop. The second hypothesis states that the appearance of cyberspace has led to a shift in opportunities from physical space to cyberspace. This could have led to an increase in property-related criminal activity connected to the Internet to the detriment of physical crime which would not be reflected in the statistics. Both premises are supported by empirical evidence.
"Cybercrime across the Taiwan Strait has become a global issue. Due to the large number of Internet users and the special political situation across the Taiwan Strait, the Republic of China (Taiwan hereafter) and the People's Republic of China (China hereafter) are two countries where malicious computer activity is rampant. Malicious computer activity across the Taiwan Strait has an impact not only on Taiwan and China but also on many other countries. For example, it has been reported that there have been computer attacks against the USA originating from computers in Taiwan but controlled by command and control servers in China. It is important to understand the current policing measures taken by Taiwan and China against cybercrime; however, there is limited empirical research on this issue. To fill this gap, this paper will, based on interviews conducted in Taiwan and China in 2008-2009, discuss current problems and issues that the Taiwanese and Chinese governments face when policing cybercrime. It will also examine whether current existing semi-governmental and informal cooperative measures against cross-Strait crime are adequate in addressing the problem of cross-Strait cybercrime."
The Deloitte's report (2015) on cybersecurity trends states that emerging technologies, coupled with a shifting threat profile, are challenging organizations to deal more and more with sophisticated bad actors that are motivated, skilled, and adaptable [1]. There is little doubt that cybercrime is growing more rapidly than cybersecurity measures are able to deal with and businesses and governments have never been more at risk from cyberattacks. In this paper, we ask the question, 'what are some of the robust data governance practices that can be put in place to forestall cybercrime?' We also asked the question, 'are there some research papers that have been published to address this concern? We then took a deep into extant literature to find out. Furthermore, we proposed a cybercrime mitigation framework using robust data governance. Our literature synthesis revealed that there is little research that investigated the concept of data governance and cybercrime together, which leads us to propose research hypotheses for a future quantitative research.
"This study explicated individual differences in susceptibility to cybercrime victimization by predicting that frequent use of information technology (IT) devices is related to greater likelihood of cybercrime victimization (exposure hypothesis), and testing whether individuals more vulnerable to cybercrimes are characterized by higher (overconfidence hypothesis) or lower (negligence hypothesis) levels of IT self-efficacy. Our study also investigated whether cybercrime victimization would influence one's perception of interpersonal relations and subjective well-being. Data were drawn from a representative sample of 1018 Hong Kong participants (46% men; mean age = 42.18). The results from correlation analysis supported the exposure hypothesis by revealing a positive association between IT use and cybercrime victimization. Consistent with both the exposure and overconfidence hypotheses, the mediation analysis showed that IT self-efficacy was positively related to IT use, which in turn was positively related to cybercrime victimization. The correlation analysis further revealed that cybercrime victimization was inversely associated with trusting people online, perceived control, perceived fairness, life satisfaction, and happiness. Our novel findings imply escalating risks of cybercrime victimization as both the amount of IT use and users' IT proficiency are growing, and evidence-based programs are needed to increase users' awareness of the prevalence of cybercrimes and build resilience to combat cyber-attacks."
Cybercrime, one of the most important security topics, will continue to emerge as a more critical security threat within the next years. Among the different attacks, phishing is of special interest because of its negative impact for the economy. In this paper, we develop a simulation study based on the work of Fultz and Grossklags. To extend their analysis of cybercrime by an economic view, we customized their model and used it as basis for our analysis. Based on the data from recent literature, our assessment gives insights into the perpetrator's behavior and allows us to quantify the effectiveness of countermeasures. Due to the fact that mainly risk-seeking persons are responsible for these attacks, countermeasures aiming at increasing the penalties are not very effective. We discovered that better control of dark markets to prevent the trading of stolen data has a much higher impact. In general, results of our simulation can be used to analyze the perpetrator's economic motives and to establish a basis for effective countermeasures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
(1) Background: This paper combines lifestyle-routine activities (L-RAT) and self-control (SCT) theories along with the literature on smartphone addiction in a joint model that addresses the multiple vulnerabilities that make the smartphone user a potential victim of cybercrime. This model, which we call the dual vulnerability model of cybercrime victimization, was subjected to empirical testing on a nationally representative sample of smartphone users. (2) Methods: Data from 2837 participants from a nationally representative sample of Spanish smartphone users were modeled using Mplus causal modeling software. (3) Results: The results of the study confirm the predictions of L-RAT and SCT in explaining cybercrime victimization (higher cybercrime victimization under conditions of high exposure, proximity, and suitability, relative absence of capable guardian, and low self-control). A significant effect of smartphone addiction on cybercrime victimization was also observed above and beyond L-RAT and SCT predictors. (4) Conclusions: The potential victim of cybercrime presents a double vulnerability, on the one hand, those identified by criminological theories such as L-RAT and SCT, and on the other hand, those derived from the deregulated-addicted use of the Internet access device (smartphone in our work).
The present study reveals hidden patterns of group membership across cybercrime victims in European countries. We used a multilevel latent class analysis of data from the 2019 Eurobarometer, a regionally representative sample of 21,908 individuals from 28 countries, to identify such subgroups and patterns of cybercrime victimization. The findings suggest there are two overarching cybercrime victim profiles in Europe based on individuals' levels of online activity and cybersecurity guardianship: the at-risk class (19%, higher risk) and the cautious class (81%, lower risk). Ten different types of cybercrime victimization were compared, and while individual-level predictors were primarily used to produce different groups of cybercrime victims, our findings suggest that researchers consider both individual- and country-level predictors to understand cybercrime victimization patterns in greater depth.
As the web rapidly expands and gets integrated into all kinds of business, cyber security has become increasingly important for companies. In order to defend against the rising web attacks, several advanced security mechanism have been proposed, with varying degree of adoption. The presence of these mechanisms on a website can be used as an indicator of the security awareness and practices of that website. A step further, it can be argued that the adoption of advanced security practices by a website not only secures the web presence, but is also proxy for the quality of the companies security management practice in general. So organisations with a secure presence should ultimately suffer less losses due to security incidents. In this paper, we present first results regarding this hypothesis. To achieve this, we simultaneously investigated the impact of cybercrime on Belgian companies and the adoption of security mechanisms on companies' websites. Through a correlation analysis, we found that companies with better web security defence tend to have less business loss and reputation damage caused by web attacks.
Reports have shown that Taiwan and China are attractive targets for cybercriminals. The special political situation between the two countries has encouraged numerous cyber-attacks across the Taiwan Strait. Establishing an efficient investigation and prosecution system is important to deter criminals from further exacerbating this unsatisfactory situation. This paper discusses issues of cybercrime investigation and prosecution across the Taiwan Strait. Based on interview data collected in 2008 and 2009, in both China and Taiwan, this paper concludes that the current manpower dedicated to cybercrime investigation is insufficient. In addition, there is insufficient incentive to attract investigators to devote their time to cybercrime investigation, and prosecutors and judges' knowledge of cybercrime and information security is lacking. Informal relations, such as Guan-xi and Mo-chi, may help in mutual cooperation between crime investigation agencies. However, these rely heavily on the political situation existing at any one time, and can only be effective when relations between Taiwan and China are not tense.
The Slovenian perspective on the comprehension and public attitudes towards cyber threats and cybercrime is presented. Considering that access to information technology and the Internet is ubiquitous, cyberspace has become a wide area which can be exploited through various criminal activities. As the number of users grows, so do the incidences of cybercrime. Regrettably, users of information technology and the Internet know too little about the dangers in cyberspace and protective measures to maximize security as well as about legislation about cybercrime. In order to accurately gauge the knowledge of the average internet user, we conducted a survey which was posted on the Internet in spring 2011, is the basis for an examination of the perception of cybercrime and an attempt to make sense of the fear of it. The results of the survey are described. The statistical analysis of the questionnaire results show, how users perceive cybercrime. We can see that respondents are relative well informed about cybercrime, but predominantly about incidences exposed in the media. As we know, cyber threats under the media spotlight are not necessarily examples of the greatest threats to users, but they do increase their fear of cybercrime. On the basis of theory and the results of our research, we present the main guidelines that can, if adhered to, minimize security risks in cyberspace. These guidelines can help increase awareness of cyber threats and are a source of information on how to safely interact in cyberspace. Users who are more aware of the risks in cyberspace and know how to deal with them are less afraid of becoming victims of cybercrime. The insights acquired in our research are useful for all cyberspace users and have practical value as they can be used for further study of cybercrime.
This article provides a multi-disciplinary overview of the contemporary cybercrime ecosystem and its developments. It does so by reviewing and synthesising recent cybercrime research from fields such as cybersecurity, law and criminology. The article also examines ways in which gaps between the aforementioned fields arise and how to lessen them to increase cybersecurity. This article is divided into four main parts. The first part offers background on cybercrime and some of its main elements. It defines terminology, sets out a legal taxonomy of cybercrime offences and presents the estimated costs, threat agents and characteristics of various illicit activities and technical aspects of cybercrime. Parts two, three and four build on this preceding analysis by (separately) examining three prominent threat vectors within the ecosystem - malware, the darknet and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For each threat vector, the article identifies and investigates features, history, functions and current and expected states of development within the ecosystem. Through its attention to and synthesis of current research and results from different fields, this article offers a synoptic account of the cybercrime ecosystem, which can bridge potential knowledge gaps between fields.

In this note, the most frequent types of computer crime on the Internet in Ukraine are analysed. It is suggested that international experience in computer crime investigation should be used to combat this because cybercrime has become an international problem, causing enormous damage to governments, commercial entities, and computer systems of individual users. Governments and commercial entities spend significant funds to prevent losing information and ensure its protection. Cybercrime is based on technical knowledge, which is difficult to detect or prevent. This type of criminal activity has a high latency because of the difficulty of determining the qualification of a criminal offence.
Cybercrimes are cases of indictable offences and misdemeanors that involve computers or communication tools as targets and commission instruments or are associated with the prevalence of computer technology. Common forms of cybercrimes are child pornography, cyberstalking, identity theft, cyber laundering, credit card theft, cyber terrorism, drug sale, data leakage, sexually explicit content, phishing, and other forms of cyber hacking. They mostly lead to a privacy breach, security violation, business loss, financial fraud, or damage in public and government properties. Thus, this study intensively reviews cybercrime detection and prevention techniques. It first explores the different types of cybercrimes and discusses their threats against privacy and security in computer systems. Then, it describes the strategies that cybercriminals may utilize in committing these crimes against individuals, organizations, and societies. It also reviews the existing techniques of cybercrime detection and prevention. It objectively discusses the strengths and critically analyzes the vulnerabilities of each technique. Finally, it provides recommendations for the development of a cybercrime detection model that can detect cybercrimes effectively compared with the existing techniques.
"The Internet has afforded people a multitude of opportunities to engage in crime and deviance online. Despite recent research efforts the application of criminological theories to the topic of cybercrime has returned mixed results. Furthermore, no study to date has sought to examine the effect of personality on individual differences in motivations to engage in cybercrime. In this study we use reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) proposed by Gray (1982; 1987) as a framework for explaining cybercrime. RST is increasingly being used to explain individual differences in a range of behaviors including a wide range of criminal behaviors. In this study, 577 participants reported engagement in cybercrime behaviors and completed the RST Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ). Overall, we found support for the hypothesis that RST related traits were associated with cybercrime. The four BAS subfactors (Reward Interest, Goal-Drive Persistence, Reward Reactivity, and Impulsivity) were found to have differing relationships with cybercrime. BIS traits were also positively associated with cybercrime, possibly deriving from the effect of increased anonymity online on the role of the BIS as a conflict mediator. Overall, this study supports the application of RST to the study of cybercrime while emphasizing the need for future research to (1) disaggregate the varying effects of BAS activation on engagement in specific types of cybercriminal behaviors and (2) further explore the unique effect of online anonymity on RST processes that motivate deviant behaviors online."
This study examines the impact of risk governance on cybercrime of selected listed firms in the Nigerian financial institutions. To achieve this, a sample size of 50 listed companies from the Nigerian financial sector was selected for the years 2013-2017, resulting in 250 observations. The study employed the use of hierarchical regression analysis to test the impact of risk governance variables (Chief Risk Officer_centrality, Enterprise Risk Management_index, Chief Risk Officer_presence, Board Risk Committee_size, Board Risk Committee_activism, and Board Risk Committee_independence) and other control variables such as corporate governance variables (Board Size and Board of Directors_independence) and firm characteristics variables (Firm size and firm age) on cybercrime. The study observed from the findings that almost all the explanatory variables present a positive and significant relationship with cybercrime, except the Chief Risk Officer_presence, firm age and Board Risk Committee_size which revealed an insignificant relationship with cybercrime. The study concludes that risk governance variables and other variables are likely to reduce and minimize the impact of cybercrime on the sampled firms used in this study.
This study developed a psychometric scale to measure users' cybercrime awareness level on social media. Psychometric properties of the Cybercrime Awareness on Social Media Scale (CASM-S) were tested based on data collected from 1045 social media users. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with principal components analysis was used to identify the underlying factor structure of the scale (N = 545). The results revealed that the scale has a unidimensional factor structure. The scale was found to have a high internal reliability (alpha = .957). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to verify factor structure of the CASM-S (N = 500). Results revealed that the one-factor model fits the data well (x(2)/DF = 2.757, CFI = .939, SRMR = .0366, RMSEA = .059). Further, the study evaluated the concurrent validity of the scale (r = .855, p < .001). The findings revealed that the CASM-S is a reliable and valid tool to measure users' cybercrime awareness level on social media.
This article speaks to the societal implications of technology by discussing the problems presented by cybercrime. It identifies a twofold problem. The first is that the proliferation of cybercrime is outstripping the pace at which governments can respond. The second is that there is a tendency to respond to issues relating to cybercrime on a superficial level without the appropriate technical understanding of the elements of cybercrime. This paper proposes that one of the ways of tackling cybercrime is to adopt the Routine Activities Theory, particularly the element of target suitability. This paper proposes that once a suitable target has been identified, the Gordon & Ford categorisation of cybercrimes be adopted as a policy framework for legislation and conventions. It illustrates the proposition by applying the categorisation to the South African Cybercrimes Bill.
Today, IT plays a key role in the information-intensive global economy. The application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data has become widespread in a global context. However, this has brought with its major challenges in information security. A new reality was addressed in this Information Age in which we live, which is the increase of cybercrime on a global level. Due to the high growth of cybercrime on a global scale and the lack of a global treaty to combat these crimes, the need to implement measures against these types of crimes in cyberspace was born. The main objective of this text is through information technologies to provide a model for predicting cybercrime. It used the program RapidMiner which contains different data mining techniques. Within the different data mining techniques, the decision tree technique was used. Basically, this data mining technique consists of two stages, the first learning stage and the second prediction stage. The repository communities and crimes was obtained, with which the decision tree technique was carried out. In the first stage it turned out that, among all the dimensions analyzed, popilation (population per community) turned out to be the dimension with the greatest weight with respect to the other dimensions in cybercrime. In the second stage it was feasible to apply data mining to prevent cybercrime. Among the communities established in the prediction process, all resulted with a minimum probability of being victims of cybercrime again.
Digitalization changes the nature of economic relations, the ways of production and promotion of goods and services, the mechanisms of interaction between contractors, and the methods of meeting consumer needs. Information and communication technologies, Internet resources and digital artifacts create new opportunities for an individual, an economic entity, and a state, while at the same time being a major challenge to global security. In the digital space, solving the problem of ensuring cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important all over the world. Today, we need to understand it, and build the capacity to deploy appropriate strategies to improve cyber security. The purpose of the study is to identify cybercrime as a new systemic threat to the economic security of an individual, firm, or state, to identify its motives and methods of manifestation, and to develop an interdisciplinary approach to leveling this threat. The relationship between economic security and the processes of digitalization of social and economic relations is established. The types of cybercrime are systematized and its specifics are specified depending on the subject against which the illegal action is being taken -an individual, a firm, or a state. The analysis of the world practice of countering cybercrime allowed us to develop a pyramid of cybersecurity and propose a set of measures to prevent criminal acts in the information space.
With the increased use of ICT in different areas of contemporary life, the widespread access to the Internet, and the use of social media, individuals and organisations face constant threats and challenges resulting from the bad consequences of cybercrimes. Research shows that the incidence of cybercrime is increasing. In response to these threats and challenges, government and law enforcement agencies in different countries around the world have enacted anti-cybercrime laws. The aim of this paper is to compare the existing anti-cybercrime laws in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It adopts a comparative research approach. According to the findings, although these countries share common traditions and Islamic, legal, cultural and social values, there are some similarities and differences in their anti-cybercrime laws. Furthermore, there is variation in the scope of addressing cybercrimes. The paper highlights some issues related to these laws and provides suggestions for improvement and future research.
The information space, the main components of which are information resources, means of information interaction, and information infrastructure, is a sphere of modern social life in which information communications play a leading role. The objective process is the gradual but stable entry of the national information space into the European and world information sphere, in the context of which there is a legitimate question of its protection as one of the components of the national security of Ukraine. However, the implementation of this issue in practice immediately faces the need to respect the rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international regulations and the Constitution of Ukraine, especially in the field of cybersecurity. The peculiarity of the modern economy is related to its informational nature, which affects the sharp increase in cyber incidents in the field of information security, which is widespread and threatening and affects a wide range of private, corporate, and public interests. The problem of forming an effective information security system is exacerbated by the spread of cybercrime as a leading threat to information security both in Ukraine and around the world. The purpose of this study is to analyze the state of cybersecurity and on this basis to identify new areas of the fight against cybercrime in Ukraine. Methods: the study is based on an extensive regulatory framework, which primarily consists of regulatory acts of Ukraine. The main methods were inductions and deductions, generalizations, statistical, comparative, and system-structural analysis, grouping, descriptive statistics, interstate comparisons, and graphical methods. Results. It is noted that a very important component of Ukraine's national security is the concept of information terrorism, which includes cyberterrorism and media terrorism that will require its introduction into the law. An assessment of the state of cybersecurity in Ukraine is given. Based on the trend analysis, further growth of cybercrimes was predicted, and ABC analysis showed the existence of problems in the field of security of payment systems. Insufficient accounting of cybercrime and the absence in the current legislation of all relevant components of cybersecurity does not allow the definition of a holistic system of counteraction. Therefore, the proposed new legal norms in the field of information security take into account modern research in the field of promising areas of information technology development and the latest algorithms for creating media content.
Economic geographers have traditionally been reluctant to extend their analysis to illicit and illegal markets despite their being significant in their global economic extent and displaying highly uneven geographies. By contrast, the geographies of licit, legal industries have produced multiple traditions of empirically rich, theoretically diverse accounts. Our understandings of the spatialities of illicit and illegal 'industries' derive from a different set of intellectual traditions for whom space is a less explicit, central concern. This paper aims to advance our understanding of the geographies of illegal economic activities by exploring the spatialities of one illegal industry, cybercrime (online for-profit fraud), through the lens of economic geography. It considers the spaces within which cybercrime is embedded, exploring it as the product of factors operating at multiple scales. It reviews cybercrime scholarship focused, variously, at the local, national and transnational scales and examines factors salient to the production of cybercrime through case studies at these scales. It examines national level drivers of cybercrime, local cybercrime agglomerations in Europe and transnational asymmetries, connections and opacities and the production of cybercrime. In each case, it reflects upon the potentials for the development of more spatially informed readings of cybercrime specifically, and illegal economic activities more generally, and considers how this might be mobilised to inform anti-cybercrime policy. The paper speaks to both theme I of this special edition 'the interactions, the norms, the rituals, the behaviours of OCGs in physical spaces' and theme III 'the interactions between OCGs and institutions such as the political and economic field'.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in December 2019 and the restrictive measures that were implemented to slow down the spread of the virus have had a significant impact on our way of life. The sudden shift from offline to online activities and work may have resulted in new cybersecurity risks. The present study therefore examined changes in the prevalence, nature and impact of cybercrime among Dutch citizens and SME owners, during the pandemic. Qualitative interviews with ten experts working at various public and private organizations in the Netherlands that have insights into cybercrime victimization and data from victim surveys administrated in 2019 and 2021 were analyzed. The results show that there was only a small, non -statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cybercrime during the pandemic among citizens and SME owners. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic did have an impact on the modus operandi of cybercriminals: victims indicated that a considerable proportion of the offenses was related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the case of online fraud. Moreover, the use of new applications and programs for work was associated with an increased risk of cybercrime victimization during the COVID-19 crisis. These results suggest that increases in rates of registered cybercrime that were found in previous studies might be the consequence of a reporting effect and that cybercriminals adapt their modus operandi to current societal developments.
Principally driven by a phenomenal increase in Internet users, Vietnam, amongst all the countries in Southeast Asia, leads with its gross merchandise value share in the GDP. However, Vietnam is regarded as not only a cybercrime center, but is also among countries hardest hit by targeted attacks. This study explores the context of cybercrime in Vietnam through published and unpublished reports of certain organizations. Subsequently, by adopting the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) based on three core factors, the study will examine the causation of cybercrime originating from Vietnam's social situation and will conclude by highlighting the significance of this theory in cyberspace.
Malware authors constantly obfuscate their files and defenders regularly develop new techniques to detect them. Given this cat-and-mouse game, specialized obfuscation services have appeared in the cybercrime industry. These services allow malware authors to obfuscate their code for a fee. This study investigates an automated obfuscation-as-a-service platform for Android applications and yields unique insights on the technical difficulties and business reality of those behind such a specialized service. The service investigated was found to be average in quality, mainly using known obfuscation techniques, and generating obfuscated applications that were still detected by anti-viruses. It had a small clientele of large-scale attackers who used the service to decrease anti-virus detections of highly malicious applications, thus increasing their chances of compromising devices. Depending on the price bundles considered, operators offering the service were estimated to have made a minimum revenue ranging from USD 5,100 (conservative) to USD 61,160 (optimistic) for a six-month operation. This study illustrates that even though obfuscation-as-a-service is a market niche, taking advantage of the value added from this specialization is not effortless nor easily accessible to everyone involved in cybercrime.
This article contributes to the growing debate about the increasing importance of 'data' in modern cybercrime offending. In so doing, it illustrates the linkages between cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crime bringing into focus the inability of current cybercrime legal categories to reflect such linkages which ultimately reflects how practitioners interpret them. Drawing upon data from court cases the article models the cybercrime cascade effect that results from data crimes. We argue that cybercrime is not a single action, but a process of interconnected social and technical actions in which data from 'upstream' cyber-dependent data crimes cascades 'downstream' to enable additional cyber-enabled crimes, such as scams, frauds and deceptions. By modelling the various tipping points at which stolen data cascades downstream we increase knowledge about the cybercrime ecosystem to highlight points at which interventions can be more effectively targeted. The 'cascade effect' is modelled by using mixed methods from law and criminology which include the intermediate-N configurational comparative method. By refining the tipping points of the cascade into decision trees, additional hypotheses, and the identification of the means to test them can be formulated. The article suggests that tipping points occur at each stage of the cascade model, however, the cascade into more crime is not found to be an automatic outcome as more social factors may be involved. Moreover, there exist layers of victimisation, which highlights the need to further research ways to incentivize early-offender interventions. Finally, the article illustrates the complexities of online offending, which include the presence of diverse, distributed and even disorganized actors within organised groups which do not easily fit into the traditional organized crime narrative.
Is cybercrime different from traditional crime? Is there such a thing as cybercrime? There are several proposals for definition of cybercrime, and several analyses and proposals for a taxonomy. This paper presents an overview of currently available taxonomies and considers how useful these could be in mapping cyber criminal journeys. In order for individuals, enterprises and states to be informed about the motivations, methods and modi operandi of cyber criminals and thereby begin to protect themselves, it is useful to understand how a cyber crime takes place from its initial stages of motivation and intent, until exit. This paper uses the methodology of journey mapping as a basis for proposing a four-level taxonomy of cyber crime. This is significant because a common framework and taxonomy will help to more effectively analyse, as well as find targeted preventive and awareness-building measures in the fight against cybercrime.
This article analyzes the international legal framework against cybercrime. The international legal framework provides a solution to the problem in three areas: reducing discrepancies between national laws, introducing new powers of authorities, and promoting international cooperation. The study argues that the core documents effectiveness in the field of cybercrime counteraction does not appear to be dependent on the legal applicability of the international measures. Such factors as national security, politics, economics, and public opinion, apparently, stimulate the spontaneous implementation of the international legal framework. The study focuses on the need to develop a system of basic approaches in the field of criminal law cybercrime qualification and consolidate their classification at the supranational level. A qualitatively new approach to cooperation between international relations subjects in combating cybercrime is proposed. The latter is based on all states actions coordination in improving the legal regulation of interaction and implementation of fundamental rules in national legislation, reorganizing the information exchange basics.
Cybercrimes have an adverse impact on the reputation and economy of a nation. This paper investigates the factors that affect the frequency of cybercrime originating within a country. These factors were grouped into three categories, namely, economic capital, technological capital, and cybersecurity preparedness. On analyzing the data from 124 countries, it emerges that the economic capital and technological capital of a country are the primary factors that influence the frequency of cybercrime originating within it. Technological capital also partially mediates the relationship between economic capital and the frequency of cybercrime originating within the nation. Furthermore, the cybersecurity preparedness of a nation negatively moderates the relationship between technological capital and frequency of cybercrime originating within it. The findings have significant implications for policymakers at the national level and managers at the organizational level concerning cybersecurity preparedness. They should focus on both hard (legal, technical, organizational) and soft (training and co-operational) aspects of cybersecurity preparation to minimize the incidence of cybercrime within a nation.
We document and evaluate emerging policing strategies that are reshaping how centralised law enforcement agencies deal with online cybercrime markets. The first of these we term infrastructural policing, drawn from law enforcement campaigns to disrupt international drug markets and involving targeting the administrators who maintain the infrastructure supporting cybercrime markets. The second, we term influence policing, a strategy drawn from counter-radicalisation involving the delivery of highly targeted messaging campaigns to potential customers. We illustrate these with a study of the online market for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, conducting a longitudinal analysis of five years of time series attack data to establish the effect of interventions. While arresting and sentencing key players had little lasting effect on DoS attacks (due to jurisdictional issues which the Internet poses), after infrastructure administrators were targeted with takedowns there was a significant reduction in attacks and a dramatic reshaping of market structure. Additionally, the use of search engine advertisements targeted at potential customers in the UK was associated with a cessation in growth in attacks in this country. We interviewed law enforcement to explore the rationales behind the interventions, and interviewed DoS attack providers and observed their online communication channels to explore these effects in depth. We argue that these emerging forms of online policing constitute (apparently successful) attempts by law enforcement to recenter themselves as key actors in online enforcement coalitions. This rests on them enrolling the capacities of the platform intermediaries who provide the very Internet infrastructure which so complicates traditional, jurisdictionally-bound forms of policing.
Cybercrime is, undoubtedly, a growing problem. Scarcely a week goes by without reports of massive online misconduct. The primary federal legislative response so far has been to impose computer abuse liability on network attackers. Every state has enacted a similar statute. But do these cybercrime statutes actually punish and deter hackers? Members of Congress and Department of Justice prosecutors think so and have repeatedly sought to expand the scope and consequences of liability. Meanwhile, scholars, advocates, and some judges have argued that computer abuse legislation is overbroad and ineffective. Law and policy debate has proceeded from these dueling narratives, not from data. This Article presents the first comprehensive empirical analysis of litigation under the federal cybercrime statute, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Drawing on a new dataset compiled from hundreds of civil and criminal pleadings, the Article addresses fundamental and unanswered questions about the on-the-ground function of cybercrime law. The data reflect that there has been a nationwide cybercrime litigation explosion, and most cases look nothing like the hacker archetype. The overwhelming majority of civil claims arise from mundane business and employment disputes, not sophisticated computer intrusions. And while federal prosecutors do sometimes charge serious offenders, the plurality fact pattern in criminal litigation involves a low-level government employee mishandling data. What's more, cybercrime law appears to be redundant in civil cases, and there is little reason to believe that it deters the most concerning hackers. The Article closes with normative recommendations. In the near term, I suggest that (1) Congress and state legislatures should repeal civil cybercrime liability, (2) prosecutors should establish enforcement policies that prioritize significant misconduct, and (3) courts should narrowly construe cybercrime statutes to better effectuate legislative intent. As a structural matter, I challenge the net benefit of cybercrime law. An expansive computer abuse construct is a poor fit for modern technology, which is increasingly pervasive and increasingly shared. Policy should emphasize alternative means of protecting computer security and privacy.
The article is devoted to the study of the problem of dark figure of cybercrime: crimes in which the use of information technologies and telecommunication networks plays a significant role, often remain latent. It can be said that this type of crime is characterized by excessive latency: only an extremely small proportion of committed acts is reflected in criminal statistics, and often the most dangerous remain in the dark. Law enforcement tends to focus on most convenient cybercrime that is easier to investigate and prosecute. Authors examine the dark figure of cybercrime of two types: traditional computer crimes (illegal access to computer information, use and distribution of malicious programs) and violation of copyright. Most relevant threats related to the commission of these types of crimes are described. Authors emphasize such factors of latent crime as criminals' use of technology to conceal their activities, the anomalously large role of the non-state sector in counteracting cybercrime, conflicting interests of victims, and weaknesses in legal regulation. Authors propose measures aimed at reducing latent figure, namely: improving the competence of law enforcement agencies, in particular, the establishment of special jurisdiction of these crimes, the creation of monitoring services that identify and analyze the emerging threats to information security and provide evidence to law enforcement agencies to initiate criminal cases, making new fines for business that conceal cybercrime incidents. It is pointed out the to reduce dark figures it is also needed to decriminalize less dangerous infringements, and reorient law enforcement agencies to combat the most dangerous manifestations of cybercrime.
"Cybercrime and economic espionage are increasing problems for firms. We build on US FBI policy to frame the interaction between a cybercrime victim firm and a government security agency. We bring together several strands in the literature to model the strategies of the firm, which has suffered a cyber breach and theft of trade secrets, and the government security agency, which must investigate and prosecute crimes. We investigate the interactions between these two players, in which the firm has private information about its cybersecurity investment. This investment level is unknown to the security agency, which must nonetheless decide how to prioritize reported crime. We model this asymmetric information problem within a game theoretic signaling framework derived from Becker's work in crime and punishment. We suggest that such a framework can inform policy to encourage security investments by firms and more efficient resource utilization by security agencies. We particularly focus on an illustrative stylized example to highlight how our modelling approach can be helpful. In this example we compare two worlds; one where all security breaches become public knowledge and another where only reported breaches become public knowledge. We then formulate two potentially testable Hypotheses and several implications of these Hypotheses. Case studies and a policy analysis further highlight how our framework plays out in reality.

Deficiencies in cybersecurity may be the greatest national security threat facing the US in the 21st century. Public and private sector organizations as well as individuals are vulnerable, and the nation's critical infrastructures are also put at risk by these deficiencies. Security professionals, designers, and engineers are currently faced with the challenge of securing cyberspace. Essential to this effort is the necessity to ensure that the nation's laws are adequate to protect against, prevent, and deter cyberattacks. In this article we present a comprehensive review of current US laws and regulations that are being used to deter cybercrime activities and support cybersecurity. We describe legislation presented in the 112th Congress aimed at strengthening laws in fighting cybercrimes and ensuring a high level of cybersecurity, and we briefly review legislative efforts being undertaken in other countries. Finally, we discuss some future issues to be addressed in the growing area of cyberlaw.
In forensic investigations, automation support for cybercrime classification is crucial for efficient and effective resolution. Although numerous technologies have been developed to assist digital forensic investigators and incident responders in data analysis, investigation still requires a significant amount of manual effort, which is time-consuming and costly. Machine learning has been proven to be a promising strategy for automated data classification in recent studies. However, in order to train the model, most, if not all, machine learning algorithms rely substantially on a large number of annotated datasets. In this paper, based on a few historical case records, we propose an effective and efficient approach to classifying cybercrime, starting with small datasets. Our proposed method uses a Siamese Network Architecture with two identical Convolutional Neural subnetworks, as well as a Deep Learning Model. To classify novel graph data, a similarity metric forecasting method is applied, which permits the categorization of new data from a limited number of cybercrime records. In addition, to improve the accuracy of our Deep Learning Model, we apply forensic knowledge graph technology. This technique assembles pieces of information gathered from security logs into a vast, connected graph to expose a case's contextual background. Even with a small number of labeled samples trained in the Deep Learning model, our proposed approach is capable of identifying cybercrime data reliably and automatically from our experimental assessments. As a result, our approach demonstrates that automated cybercrime investigations can be both successful and feasible.
This study examined a sample of transnational computer fraud cases involving bank card fraud and phone scams investigated by the Vietnamese police between 2010 and 2018. This research used social network analysis to evaluate the relationships between computer fraud suspects. The study combined data from criminal profiles and in-depth interviews with police officials to determine the structural characteristics of sample cases. Results showed that transnational computer fraud in Vietnam occurs online and offline, with primary modus operandi including bank card fraud and phone scams. Moreover, the organizational structures of transnational computer fraud in Vietnam differ from those broadly assumed by scholars. Accordingly, this study proposes that the degree of leadership within cybercriminal networks can be used to construct a new typology with four categories: 'swarm networks,' 'distributed networks,' 'single-directed networks,' and 'group-directed networks.' As the first study of this nature conducted in Vietnam, this study contributes to the literature of cybercrime and especially, to the knowledge of transnational computer fraud in Asia and beyond.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved rapidly and affected almost all the world's countries, creating unprecedented chaos on human lives, physical health, mental wellbeing, and the world economy. During this time, digital space has become an indispensable global means of communication, entertainment, and social interaction. However, high reliance on digital tools increases the risk of being prey to cyberattacks. In order to explore the cybercrime threat landscape, empirical research was conducted to examine the shared experiences related to cybercrime threats during the enforcement of the Movement Control Order in Malaysia. Data was collected using an online survey among 332 respondents across Malaysia. The finding stipulated that most of the respondents comprised females aged between 18 and 28 years old. The result also indicated that majority of female became victims of online phishing/malware distribution [(M = 0.58, SD = 0.13); t (113) = 2.24, p = 0.02] and online sexual harassment [(M = 0.56, SD = 0.11); t (107) = 2.38, p = 0.01]. The understanding of cybercrime experiences faced by the public during MCO is essential to help law enforcement agencies to stay vigilant on issues related to public safety and security during unprecedented conditions."
As internet penetration increases in Lower and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), more older people are now conducting financial transactions online and using social media to stay in touch with family and friends. We discuss concerns that existing financial regulations and controls in India may afford older people insufficient protection from cybercrime, using qualitative interviews from our recent study exploring older people?s experiences of cybercrime in Mumbai.
"The principles that govern a sovereign's exercise of jurisdiction to prohibit conduct and to sanction those who violate such prohibitions are well-established as to conduct occurring in the real, physical world. These principles evolved over the last several millennia, as law increased in sophistication and life became more complex. Real-world crime is, almost exclusively, a local phenomenon; the perpetrator(s) and victim(s) are all physically present at a specific geographical point when a crime is committed. The principles that govern the exercise of criminal jurisdiction are therefore predicated on the assumption that crime is a territorial phenomenon. Cybercrime makes these principles problematic in varying ways and in varying degrees. Unlike real-world crime, it is not physically grounded; cybercrime increasingly tends not to occur in a single sovereign territory. The perpetrator of a cybercrime may physically be in Country A, while his victim is in Country B, or his victims are in Countries B, C, D and so on. The perpetrator may further complicate matters by routing his attack on the victim in Country B through computers in Countries F and G. The result of these and other cybercrime scenarios is that the cybercrime is not committed in the territory of a single sovereign state; instead, pieces of the cybercrime occur in territory claimed by several different sovereigns."
Although the prevalence of cybercrime has increased rapidly, most victims do not report these offenses to the police. This is the first study that compares associations between victim characteristics and crime reporting behavior for traditional crimes versus cybercrimes. Data from four waves of a Dutch cross-sectional population survey are used (N = 97,186 victims). Results show that cybercrimes are among the least reported types of crime. Moreover, the determinants of crime reporting differ between traditional crimes and cybercrimes, between different types of cybercrime (that is, identity theft, consumer fraud, hacking), and between reporting cybercrimes to the police and to other organizations. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.
Handling and mitigating the cybercrime incidents (CIs) have attracted significant research attention, over the last years, due to their increasing frequency of occurrence. However, the term cybercrime is often used interchangeably with other technology-linked malicious acts, such as cyberwarfare, and cyberterrorism, leading to misconceptions. In addition, there does not exist a management framework which would classify CIs, qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate their occurrence and promptly align them with appropriate measures and policies. This work introduces a Cybercrime Incident Architecture that enables a comprehensive cybercrime embodiment through feature identification, offence classification mechanisms, threats' severity labeling and a completely novel Adaptive Response Policy (ARP) that identifies and interconnects the relevant stakeholders with preventive measures and response actions. The proposed architecture consists of four separate complementary components that lead to a manually - and in the future automatically - generated ARP. The idea is to build a holistic framework toward automated cybercrime handling. A criminal case study is selected to validate the introduced framework and highlight its potentiality to evolve into a CI expert system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Purpose Cybercrime is a prevalent and serious threat to publicly traded companies. Defending company information systems from cybercrime is one of the most important aspects of technology management. Cybercrime often not only results in stolen assets and lost business but also damages a company's reputation, which in turn may affect the company's stock market value. This is a serious concern to company managers, financial analysts, investors and creditors. This paper aims to examine the impact of cybercrime on stock prices of a sample of publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach Financial data were gathered on companies that were reported in news stories as victims of cybercrime. The market price of the company's stock was recorded for several days before the news report and several days after. The percentage change in the stock price was compared to the change in the Dow Jones Industrial average to determine whether the stock price increased or decreased along with the rest of the market. Findings Stock prices were negatively affected in all time periods examined, significantly so in one period.
the productisation of crime toolkits is happening at an ever-increasing rate. Previous attacks that required in-depth knowledge of computer systems can now be purchased online. Large scale attacks previously requiring months to setup a botnet can now be scheduled for a small fee. Criminals are leveraging this opportunity of commercialization, by compromising web applications and user's browser, to gain advantages such as using the computer's resources for launching further attacks, or stealing data such as identifying information. Crime toolkits are being developed to attack an increasing number of applications and can now be deployed by attackers with little technical knowledge. This paper surveys the current trends in crime toolkits, with a case study on the Zeus botnet. We profile the types of exploits that malicious writers prefer, with a view to predicting future attack trends. We find that the scope for damage is increasing, particularly as specialisation and scale increase in cybercrime.
Ubiquity of the Internet and wide adoption of the computing and mobile devices is driving explosion of data. Interestingly, cybercriminals are also leveraging these popular technologies to cash in on cybercrime in form of scams, fraud and fake online reviews. Existing content filtering techniques, which have been successful in containing spam, are failing to filter these new types of cybercrime because cybercriminals generate text messages to bypass content filters. In this paper, we use natural language processing and a deception-detection discourse to build hybrid models for detecting these forms of text-based cybercrime. Since we have four datasets each of which contains deceptive text messages representing a specific type of cybercrime and truthful text messages, we combine 2 datasets and 3 datasets together to generate training sets for the hybrid models with more than one type of cybercrime. The hybrid cybercrime detection models are trained using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and kth Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The models are then evaluated on test sets containing instances that were not part of the training sets. The results for model performance of NB, kNN and SVM classifiers are compared against those of ANN. Most the models generalize well in detecting cybercrime. ANN model performance on the test sets ranges from 70% to 90% accuracy compared to model performance range of 60% to 80% for the other three classifiers. The best performance is in detecting unfavorable fake reviews and fraud.
Two studies were conducted to support the development of an eight-item Cybercrime Rapid Identification Tool (CRIT) and evaluate the psychometric properties of the proposed scale on samples of secondary school and university students. The CRIT was developed and evaluated in two cross-sectional studies with 2044 respondents from Hong Kong and China. Study 1 recruited 1533 secondary school students from Hong Kong with a mean age of 14.91 (SD = 1.77) years, and Study 2 recruited 511 university students from mainland China with a mean age of 20.41 (SD = 2.49) years. A stepwise confirmatory factor analytical approach was taken with further verification by exploratory factor analysis based on different samples. Factorial validity was further verified using confirmatory factor analysis. The analyses supported an eight-item scale with a two-factor structure. The eight-item CRIT was found to possess good internal consistency and concurrent validity. The studies offer promising support for the CRIT. It has the potential to advance epistemological methods and clinical research related to cybercrime prevention.
Ethiopia has been enacting various pieces of legislation to regulate some aspects of the digital environment. The cybercrime proclamation of 2016 is the most recent addition to the statute book that criminalizes a range of cybercrimes. It has also introduced a number of novel evidentiary and procedural rules that will assist in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrimes. The law has, however, attracted criticisms from various corners mainly owing to some of its human rights unfriendly provisions. This comment provides brief analysis of the cybercrime legislation and highlights some of the challenges that lie ahead in the course of putting the law into practice. (C) 2016 Kinfe Micheal Yilma.

Cybercrime has recently surpassed, in terms of volume, all other forms of crime in the United Kingdom, and has been acknowledged as a national priority. The purpose of this research is to analyse the police cyber-investigation lifecycle: from the experience of the public when reporting cybercrime to call takers, through to the attending officers, officer(s) in charge, and the many units and roles involved in supporting cybercrime investigations. A large-scale needs assessment was conducted within one of the largest police forces in England and Wales, involving focus groups and interviews with police staff and strategic leads across key units and roles. The results of the needs assessment document the state of policing cybercrime in a UK police force, along with the improvements and needs that exist across the force and in specific units and roles. In total, 125 needs were identified and further coded based on a thematic analysis. Due to the nature of the findings, it is likely that some of these identified areas may parallel other police organisations' experiences at national and international levels.
"Despite the increasing prevalence of cybercrime and its study by criminologists, very little research has examined the extent, nature, and impact of fear of cybercrime. In this study, we conducted a multilevel analysis of the 2018 Eurobarometer Cybersecurity Survey to test the applicability of routine activities theory on fear of economic cybercrime. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating that: (1) fear of economic cybercrime varies across EU member states; (2) country-level infrastructure development and income inequality are predictive of individual-level fear; (3) individual-level routine activities and sociodemographic variables are associated with fear; (4) country-level infrastructure development moderates the effects of individual-level guardianship. This paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of including country-level and individual-level determinants in fear of cybercrime research."
The neo-economy includes all businesses that wholly exist or make critical use of the internet. They operate in all parts of the world and are very developed in some parts and tender in other parts. In Africa, the neo-economy is likely the best thing that has occurred in the continent since the independence era. The opportunities of this economy in Africa are however drained by the infamous profile of Africa in cybercrime. This article is anchored on the containment theory and adopted secondary sources of data such as journal articles, newspaper publications and policy briefs to discuss how this infamous profile has hindered the successes of businesses in the neo-economy and key actions that could be taken to re-image Africa equal to cybercrime profile in the global community. The article recommends the need for African leaders to reach consensuses on meaning of cybercrime, effects, and roles each nation must play to reach an agreed result. Also, parents need to balance euphoria in their children with trainings and preparations for the harsh environments in the real world.
On social media, the way identity is presented is a misrepresentation of reality, which does not set the proper framework and opens the way for Incel ideology and other equally severe societal problems. Essentially, there is a fine line between having a place to vent emotionally and developing your identity and encouraging beliefs and attitudes that society does not want. The first one is positive, while the second one risks causing harm to others, both physically and emotionally. The anonymity of the internet can promote an aggressive and sometimes borderline violent environment when opinions clash. In fact, the online environment is now a more effective and globalised way of spreading extremist messages and targeting disaffected and marginalised young people to enlist them in violent causes. In fact, the online environment is now a more effective and globalised way of spreading extremist messages and targeting disaffected and marginalised young people to enlist them in violent causes. This article aims to provide an informed understanding of the Incel ideology's scope and nature. The paper considers how the Incel ideology has evolved, including its changing perspective, to demonstrate how members of this community can be a factor in the rise of cybercrime.
Cybercrime has become a global issue due to the continuous development of computer technology, network technology, and cryptography technology, and the establishment of global conventions has become the focus of legal research. Regional conventions and measures cannot address the problem of combating cybercrime, and global conventions are unlikely to be established. In light of international law, this paper proposes the institution of a convention and analyzes the forms and prospects of cybercrime. First, the convention's progress and future development prospects are summarized using documentary materials. Then, the convention's form and future are evaluated based on the characteristics of cybercrime, and the convention's impact on combating cybercrime is examined. Then, the effect of combating cybercrime is predicted based on the convention's progress and prospects, and its content and provisions are modified by comparing them to historical data. The increase rate reached 25.7% due to MATLAB simulation test analysis, convention analysis from the perspective of international law, and efforts to combat cybercrime. Assess the convention's content and structure based on the various types of cybercrime, evaluate the convention's development prospects, and optimize the international network environment.
Since 2010 the Universitat Jaume I (UJI) of Castellon has been teaching a degree in Criminology and Security under the Bologna approach. The degree is mainly focused on Psychology and Law courses, so students have little training in technological subjects. To solve this problem, in the last year of the degree, students are introduced in Cybersecurity and Cybercrime. In this course teachers try to train them both in theoretical and practical aspects of information and communication technologies to improve Cybersecurity and to reduce Cybercrime. The objective is to introduce conceptual training in communications, security, forensic analysis and cybercrime, and practical experience in cybercrime investigation, anonymity technologies, practical encryption and social networks. The aim of this paper is to show the methodology and learning solutions used to teach the subject during the academic years 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. Paper shows the course objectives, the target competencies, the course contents and the assessments.
The article analyses socio-economic profiles of countries that are victims of cybercrimes due to attacks by malicious programs and viruses spread through email applications, vulnerabilities of information systems and computer networks. The study is based on two hypotheses. The first is that powerful countries with significant global influence are both the cybercrime initiators and cybercrime victims to a greater extent than those with weak leverage. The second hypothesis is based on the fact that the level of socio-economic development of countries can be an indirect motivation for cyber criminals to commit mass cyberattacks. The proposed hypotheses were proved using cluster analysis based on the k-means and silhouette methods for the data from 93 countries. It formed 12 groups of countries based on the cyberattack volume on email applications and networks. Using the Farrar-Glauber test, the research revealed that identified vulnerabilities in information systems highly correlated with other factors. Thus, this factor was eliminated from the data set. An associative analysis was used to form a profile of the victim countries. It identified common socio-economic characteristics for each group and developed the rules of cause-and-effect relationships for them. The cluster analysis results confirm the first hypothesis that the most powerful countries, such as the USA, China, Germany, France, and others, are both victims of cyberattacks and their initiators. The analysis of profiles of countries' clusters based on the associative rules fully confirmed the second hypothesis.
In the serious game Operation Digital Chameleon red and blue teams develop attack and defense strategies as part of an IT security Awareness training. This paper presents the game design and selected results from a structured evaluation of techniques of neutralization applied by cybercrime threat actors. Various motives and five neutralization techniques are identified in fifteen instances of Operation Digital Chameleon. We argue that Operation Digital Chameleon is not only an instrument to raise IT security awareness but also a sensible method to explore techniques of neutralization in cybercrime.
The article reveals the essence of cybercrime, approaches to understanding this concept, classification of cybercrime, and other illegal acts in this area. The concept of cybercrime has multi-discourse nature and a certain legal uncertainty. Cybercrimes, their forms and types are analyzed in the economic context. The research vocabulary of the economic industry is defined. The scope and content of concepts denoted by the terms of the sphere covered by cybercrime are studied, and its types and forms are analyzed. The article studies problems, achievements, and prospects of resisting and combating cybercrime during the development of the civil information society and Ukraine's entry into the global information space. The study focuses on the economic motivation of most cybercrimes since some material benefit from the fact of cyber offenses is assumed directly or indirectly.
The process of prosecuting and sentencing individuals who have violated the law takes into account different factors, among which are the sentencing guidelines, which provide a guide for judges to orientate their decisions during the prosecution process. However, the variety of crimes and the evolution of cybercrime require that these criteria be applied differently, especially when new technologies are involved, in the case of cybercrimes involving child sexual abuse material (CSAM) those criteria may differ in the guidelines that apply to the other forms of cybercrime. For this reason, the present study analysed 14 documented cases in order to characterise the differences in the applications of the sentences and investigate the forms of super-vision for cybercriminals under probation. Finally, this study invites us to reflect on the challenges posed by technological advances in crime control and the need for proactive measures to improve the response of institutions in the containment and investigation of cybercrimes involving CSAM
Complex cybercrime markets face collective action problems. As they involve disparate networks of individuals, they cannot use in person persuasion or coercion to ensure cooperation. They face a tension between being open to new members and opportunities, and regulating participation. We propose that collective emotional regulation plays a crucial part in managing members' behaviours within illicit marketspaces. We take one critical case, Dark0de, which was a leading English language cybercrime market. Drawing on a publicly available dataset of internal discussions, we use Qualitative Thematic Content Analysis and Conversational Analysis to investigate how through mutual emotion regulation, this cybercrime collective managed collective action dilemmas deriving from the context of its activity, containing conflict among members and fostering cooperation along with competition. We conclude that emotional micro-dynamics are key to maintaining cybercriminal marketplaces as relatively stable communities, circumscribing individuals' actions and aligning them with emergent normative orders, enabling those communities to remain operable in adverse environments. Dark0de can be seen as a representative case for a category of digital environments where the community develops its own emotional ethnopsychology which uses displays of semi-ironic abuse and attack along with cooperation on emerging projects.
The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by a cyber pandemic, involving changes in the modi operandi of perpetrators of various crimes, and an infodemic, associated with the spread of disinformation. The article analyses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cybercrime and presents the latest research on the number of cybercrime cases in Poland and their growth dynamics. It determines the factors that contribute to the commission of a crime and prevent easy identification of criminals. It also suggests the legal and organisational changes that could reduce the number and effects of the most frequently recorded cyberattacks at a time of COVID-19. Particular attention is paid to legal problems of the growing phenomenon of identity theft, and the need to ensure better protection of users from phishing, including through education and proactive security measures consisting in blocking Internet domains used for fraudulent attempts to obtain data and financial resources.
The article analyses legislation and scientific work on combating cybercrime based on the use of a set of general and special methods, methodological principles and approaches of legal science. It is concluded that with the introduction of the term cybercrime in the criminal law of Ukraine, the use of the term cybercrime becomes relevant, which should be understood as a socially dangerous crime in cyberspace, a responsibility that is provided for by the Ukrainian law on criminal responsibility and that is also recognized as a criminal offense by international treaties that regulate the matter. Emphasis is placed on the desirability of making appropriate terminological changes in the Law of Ukraine On the Basic Principles of Cyber Security and other regulations, as well as taking other systemic measures at the conceptual and organizational level, to identify the main cybersecurity threats and formulate measures to prevent and investigate them, determine a single body for the operational management of all entities whose task is to ensure the cybersecurity, create a system of technological means of the national cybersecurity system and establish closer international cooperation.
"Using questionnaire, and In-depth Interview, data were collected from 1,031 staff and students of selected tertiary institutions in Imo State, Nigeria in order to evaluate the pattern of public awareness of cybercrime. It was found that (1) the level cybercrime awareness was very high(N=915; 89%); (2) the knowledge of cybercrime menace appeared very superficial because majority (78%; N=804) of the respondents tend to be only informed of computer-related/assisted category of cybercrime; while as low as 22% (227) were aware of only computer-focused cybercrime categories; (3) cybercrime awareness appeared to be gender sensitive in the sense that more males (91%; N=347) than females respondents (88%; N=572) tend to be aware of cybercrime; (4) there seems to be a positive relationship between level of education and awareness of cybercrime- in the sense that the highly educated Internet users tend to be more informed (N=332; 92%) about online criminal activities that the lowly educated ones (N=583; 87%); and (5) the level of cybercrime awareness increases (N=305; 97%) as Internet users get older. It was recommended that more effective and holistic cybercrime awareness campaigns, targeted more on the women and children, should be embarked upon by the stakeholders."
Social learning theories, such as differential association theory, state that criminals develop deviant behaviors and learn the tools of their trade through close association with other deviants. This case study examines a group of 99 email addresses found to be using the same PayPal phishing kit. It uses Open Source Intelligence techniques to determine potential relationships between the holders of these email addresses. The results are then discussed in light of differential association theory to determine the extent to which this theory may aid in the understanding of cybercrime.
This chapter aims to explore policy proposals to deal with one of the most complicated problems posed by the Internet, namely that of jurisdiction. While cybercrime is a phenomenon without borders, the effective prosecution of such a crime is seriously hampered by conflicts of territoriality and jurisdiction. These problems are exacerbated by the evolution of information technology, in particular cloud computing which creates 'loss of location' problems for collecting the electronic evidence indispensable for prosecuting crime. The Cloud Evidence Group-a Working Group established by decision of the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) of the Council of Europe-has proposed, within the limits of agreed legal principles of territoriality and jurisdiction, a series of measures which, together with proper implementation of the Convention, would enable fast and effective access to electronic evidence, while respecting human rights and the rule of law.
Purpose - Cybercrimes increase day by day in parallel to cyber-attacks and cyber-threats. Due to such an increase, required cybersecurity precautions against all kinds of cyber-attacks and cyber-threats should be taken by both organizations and individuals. This study aims to develop a reliable and valid measurement tool to measure cybercrime awareness levels of individuals. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, a scale named as Cybercrime Awareness Scale (CAS) has been developed and psychometric properties of the scale have been tested by two separate studies. Findings - The first study included a total of 500 respondents (294 female and 206 male). In the first study, factor structure of the proposed scale has been determined through an exploratory factor analysis. The results revealed a three-factor structure (i.e. information systems crimes, personal data crimes, and privacy and security). Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients for the subdimensions were 0.95, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. The sample of the second study consisted of 494 respondents (281 female and 213 male). The confirmatory-factor-analysis results revealed that three-factor structure is valid and optimal model. Further, the proposed scale demonstrated moderate concurrent validity results in relation to the Digital Data Security Awareness Scale. Originality/value - Findings indicated that the CAS is a valid and reliable measurement tool to measure individuals' cybercrime awareness level. This study makes a novel contribution to the existing cybersecurity literature by providing the CAS, which is developed by following rigorous methodological standards.
The amount of data stored on computers is growing rapidly every year, which makes time-consuming investigation of digital evidence in cybercrime, because of the need to investigate a large amount of data and extract criminal evidence from it. Expert investigation begins with the collection, copying and authentication of each content on the digital medium. The following steps deal with the findings and extract evidence of crime using a variety of methods and tools. Our research deals with the frameworks, methods, models and tools of the search for digital evidence of cybercrime. However, there is as yet no specialized method and tool available to assist an expert in reducing the size of investigated data and to solve the problem of searching for and identifying digital evidence of cybercrime due to the lack of specialized tools and techniques to automate expert investigation. In this paper we propose cybercrime forensic investigation tool based on the digital evidence object model
The acknowledgement that cybercrime offenders are embedded within local contexts presents a broad vector for further study. But research in this area is still in its early days and many topics need to be developed further. Foremost among these is the geography of cybercrime. This endeavour has an important policy contribution to make. For example, if we can determine which countries are producing cybercrime at more significant levels, preventative measures can be specifically targeted to those countries. The first step within such a research agenda must be the development of an index of cybercriminality by country, as this is foundational to identifying hubs of digital offending and the factors driving the emergence of these hubs. This paper is methodological in its contribution, and does not offer its own empirical findings. Instead, it aims to provide some broad foundational thinking for a very challenging research exercise, and it is intended to support later, more refined, efforts to develop indices. It consists of two components. First, it reviews existing attempts to identify and rank cybercrime hotspots. Second, it draws important lessons from these works towards developing a successful index. Some methodological points are made on what the way forward may be for this emerging field, and how a reliable and valid index on cybercriminality could be crafted.
Since the introduction of computer technologies and the internet, Russia has been trying to adopt different strategies on maintaining social order in cyberspace. The purpose of this article is, by studying the stages of enacting legislation against cybercrime, to explore the Russian model of cyberspace regulation. In order to get control over the internet and to maintain security and stability in society, the Russian government has implemented new provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and other means. This article demonstrates how criminal law and other measures may be used to fight cybercrime, and how the legislative body reacts on social concern about cybercrime. Russian legislation against cybercrime passed the same phases as cyber law in other countries: first, criminalizing and penalizing particular cybercrime types, and then, developing a complicated system of cyber regulation. The process of cyber regulation was influenced by changing cybercrime characteristics, transformation of enforcement policy, and international treaties ratified by the Russian Federation. Regardless of active efforts in fighting cybercrime, Russian hackers are still a big threat to Russia and, in general, globally. The article concludes that the hacker subculture is one of the main factors producing cybercrime.
The criminality of cybercriminals operating in Nigeria has significantly expanded from the initially dominant cyber fraud to include other categories of cybercrime. Although the Nigerian Government has tried to contain the problem, there is a shortage of scholarly information on the specific role of the Nigeria Police Force in fighting this form of crime. Given this, the central objective of this study was to investigate cybercrime policing in the Lagos State Command of the Nigeria Police Force. It was exploratory and cross-sectional in design.. Data were sourced from 27 purposively selected police personnel using in-depth and key-informant interviews. The results showed that the Lagos State Police Command routinely handled different cases of cybercrime. However, exposure to professional training in cybercrime policing skills was restricted to certain categories of officers. Although different internal and external strategies were being used by the Police Command to combat cybercrime, the overall effectiveness of its personnel was being hampered by multiple operational challenges.
This study utilizes aspects of Ferraro's risk interpretation model in order to examine how social and physical vulnerabilities and victimization experiences relate to fear of online crime using Eurobarometer survey data. The results of the regression analyses show that individuals with prior cybercrime victimization experiences, women, and individuals with lower social status and lower confidence in their ability to use the Internet report higher levels of fear. Low social status and low confidence was found to have a significant interaction effect with prior victimization experiences in relation to fear of cybercrime. Prior victimization experiences with online fraud appear to increase fear of cybercrime in low social status individuals more than other groups. Experiences with hacked accounts or cyberattacks also intensifies the fear of those with low confidence more than those with a higher amount of confidence. Overall, the results of this study indicate that social and physical vulnerabilities as well as victimization have direct and indirect effects on fear of cybercrime, just as with traditional place-based crimes.
This study aims to understand the status quo and changes of juvenile cybercrimes. Online lifestyle variables in Taiwan can serve as good predictors of juvenile cybercrime. Based on an analysis of the results, this study proposes a number of effective recommendations and guidelines for parents, schools, and institutions striving to prevent and reduce cybercrimes.

Cybercrime and cybersecurity issues in the BRICS countries have important global implications, both politically and economically. All of the fast-growing BRICS economies are members of the Group of Twenty. These economies' cybersecurity frameworks have strong similarities and striking differences. This editorial provides a comparison of BRICS economies' approaches to cybersecurity.
Social networking sites and other media applications have been admitted as compulsive communication outlets. Their vulnerability and various risks involved, these social media platforms are easy sources to commit cybercrimes. The main purpose of this study was to test the structure of fear of cybercrime among users of social networks. The sample consisted of 612 university students who used social networking sites. The snowball sampling technique was used to drive sample of the study. The study utilized a descriptive approach. An electronic Google form comprising 15 items with a focus on fear of crime was administered after taking students' informed consent. MPLUS and IBM SPSS were used to analyze data. The study tested three models of scale structure including the exploratory factor analysis to generate models. These models were then verified by confirmatory factor analysis. The three-factor model excelled exploratory and confirmatory in terms of goodness-of-fit indicators. The study recommends applying the scale with caution in future because of the low variance explained by using the scale, which reached 30.7%.
The cybercrime industry is characterised by work specialisation to the point that it has become a volume industry with various as-a-service offerings. One well-established as-a-service business model is blackmarket pay-per-install (PPI) services, which outsource the spread of malicious programmes to affiliates. Such a business model represents the archetype of specialisation in the cybercrime industry: a mass of individuals, known as affiliates, specialise in spreading malware on behalf of a service. Extant literature has focused on understanding the scope of such a service and its functioning. However, despite the large number and aggregate effect of affiliates on cybercrime, little research has been done on understanding why and how affiliates participate in such models. This study depicts the motivations and challenges of affiliates spreading Android banking Trojan applications through a blackmarket PPI service. We conducted a thematic analysis of over 6,000 of their private chat messages. The findings highlight affiliates' labour-intensive work and precarious working conditions along with their limited income, especially compared to their expectations. Affiliates' participation in cybercrime was found to be entangled between legal and blackmarket programmes, as affiliates did not care about programmes' legal status as long as they yielded money. This study contributes to the literature by providing additional evidence on the downsides of work specialisation emerging from the cybercrime industry.
Cybercrime is a pervasive threat for today's Internet-dependent society. While the real extent and economic impact is hard to quantify, scientists and officials agree that cybercrime is a huge and still growing problem. A substantial fraction of cybercrime's overall costs to society can be traced to indirect opportunity costs, resulting from unused online services. This paper presents a parsimonious model that builds on technology acceptance research and insights from criminology to identify factors that reduce Internet users' intention to use online services. We hypothesize that avoidance of online banking, online shopping and online social networking is increased by cybercrime victimization and media reports. The effects are mediated by the perceived risk of cybercrime and moderated by the user's confidence online. We test our hypotheses using a structural equation modeling analysis of a representative pan-European sample. Our empirical results confirm the negative impact of perceived risk of cybercrime on the use of all three online service categories and support the role of cybercrime experience as an antecedent of perceived risk of cybercrime. We further show that more confident Internet users perceive less cybercriminal risk and are more likely to use online banking and online shopping, which highlights the importance of consumer education.
The popularity of mobile devices in the market is impressive, but this influx of different products has made it difficult for users to secure their infrastructures from potential data breaches. As the number of exposures and attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise in security solutions offered by researchers. This article reviews the literature to prevent the cybercrime affecting portable devices especially smartphones running Android OS. Extant researches are analyzed and opportunities for future research are identified. Four research questions have been developed and out of 493 articles retrieved, 33 articles have been selected to be analyzed. From the analysis, we have found that Data leakage resulting from device loss or theft, unintentional disclosure of data and phishing attacks are most common between attackers. With no doubt, security investigators have stressed the grandness of protecting classified personal data residing in Android portable devices. They have suggested to use the permission-based security model and behavior-based detection method for protecting classified information. In result we found that Android OS can handle and apply the integrated protection model but still there are opportunities for us to improve the security of personal data. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, is one of the most vulnerable states to cyberattacks and breaches. Analyzing data from 428 online surveys collected from Virginia businesses from multiple vendors and several unique resources, this study provides an in-depth view of the nature and extent of cybercrime victimization in Virginia, highlighting specific vulnerabilities, how the victimization occurred, the consequences of victimization, and if and to whom these breaches were reported. In addition, we describe the extent to which businesses perceive their vulnerabilities, the extent in which companies engage in behaviors that can potentially make them vulnerable, the policies and practices they have in place to reduce vulnerability, and their experiences with victimization. The results provide a quality baseline for understanding cybercrimes against businesses in Virginia.
"Purpose - The study aims to determine the cybercrime awareness among secondary school students with reference to their gender and school management type. Design/methodology/approach - For the purpose, a sample of 100 students from secondary schools situated in Lucknow city, state of Uttar Pradesh, India was selected. To obtain initial data from the respondents and to determine the cybercrime awareness categories a five-point Liked type cybercrime awareness rating scale exclusively constructed to fulfil the purpose of this study was used to determine the cybercrime awareness in five categories viz; excellent, high, above average, average, below average and low cybercrime awareness. Further, t test was used to analyse the difference between the means of groups. Findings - Results revealed that gender (male and female) and type of school management (government and self-finance) are not significant predictors of cybercrime awareness among secondary school students. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to the government and self-finance English medium schools of Lucknow city. state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Practical implications - Policymakers, various societies involved in investigating cyber behavior/child computer interaction/safer communities, etc. should consider that school management is not a predictor of cybercrime along with gender and can look for other possible visible and latent factors affecting cybercrime awareness among students while formulating a policy or designing a course/prevention program for secondary school students. Social implications - School administration should consider the existing gender and school management roles of the present scenario to make effective policies for the students and providing them effective cybercrime prevention programs and activities. Also, parents can adequately understand the role of school management type and gender of their belongings to understand their cybercrime awareness and take necessary measures accordingly. Originality/value - The paper is focused on the cybercrime awareness of secondary school students and how their gender and school management type affects their cybercrime awareness. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is first of its kind which investigates the role of school management in cybercrime awareness of the students. As the education sector is depending more and more on the cyber world, this paper is of the great significance for the safety of education sector, organizations and communities involved in making the policies and designing the curriculum to avoid students being a victim of cybercrime and to make education sector a safer community."
This paper contributes to research seeking to understand if and how legislation can effectively counter cybercrimes that compromise personal data. These 'data crimes', which are the 'dark side' of big data and the data economy enabled by cloud computing, display cascading effects, in that they empower disparate criminals to commit further crimes and victimise a broad range of individuals or data subjects. The paper addresses the under -researched area of sentencing, which, as the last step of the judicial process, plays a crucial role in how the law is interpreted and implemented.This paper investigates courts' approach to the evolving technological environment of cybercrime captured by data crime and the cascade effect and whether the cascade effect can assist courts in dealing with data-driven cybercrime. The paper examines original data collected from UK courts, namely 17 sentencing remarks relating to cybercrime court cases decided in England & Wales between 2012 and 2019. The analysis shows that courts appreciate the impact of data crime and their cascading effects, but that the complexity of the offences is lost at sentencing, arguably due to the negative impact of systemic factors, such as technology neutral law and the lack of legal authorities.After examining such systemic factors, the paper suggests how the cascade effect could aid sentencing by adding specificity and context to data crime. The paper ends with avenues for further research relating to debates on fair cybercrime sentencing and open justice.
According to criminological research, online environments create new possibilities for criminal activity and deviant behavior. Problematic social media use (PSMU) is a habitual pattern of excessive use of social media platforms. Past research has suggested that PSMU predicts risky online behavior and negative life outcomes, but the relationship between PSMU and cybercrime victimization is not properly understood. In this study, we use the framework of routine activity theory (RAT) and lifestyle-exposure theory (LET) to examine the relationship between PSMU and cybercrime victimization. We analyze how PSMU is linked to cybercrime victimization experiences. We explore how PSMU predicts cybercrime victimization, especially under those risky circumstances that generally increase the probability of victimization. Our data come from nationally representative surveys, collected in Finland in 2017 and 2019. The results of the between-subjects tests show that problematic PSMU correlates relatively strongly with cybercrime victimization. Within-subjects analysis shows that increased PSMU increases the risk of victimization. Overall, the findings indicate that, along with various confounding factors, PSMU has a notable cumulative effect on victimization. The article concludes with a short summary and discussion of the possible avenues for future research on PSMU and cybercrime victimization.
Criminologists have frequently debated whether offenders are specialists, in that they consistently perform either one offense or similar offenses, or versatile by performing any crime based on opportunities and situational provocations. Such foundational research has yet to be developed regarding cybercrimes, or offenses enabled by computer technology and the Internet. This study address this issue using a sample of 37 offender networks. The results show variations in the offending behaviors of those involved in cybercrime. Almost half of the offender networks in this sample appeared to be cybercrime specialists, in that they only performed certain forms of cybercrime. The other half performed various types of crimes on and offline. The relative equity in specialization relative to versatility, particularly in both on and offline activities, suggests that there may be limited value in treating cybercriminals as a distinct offender group. Furthermore, this study calls to question what factors influence an offender's pathway into cybercrime, whether as a specialized or versatile offender. The actors involved in cybercrime networks, whether as specialists or generalists, were enmeshed into broader online offender networks who may have helped recognize and act on opportunities to engage in phishing, malware, and other economic offenses.
With the expansion of Internet use and technological innovation, cybercriminals can now easily violate laws and regulations. Because of this, cybercrime-related issues are swiftly spreading throughout Indonesia. Even though there are numerous articles, policies, and legal frameworks to combat cybercrime, much work still needs to be done. This study aims to evaluate the function of public administration in combating cybercrime in Indonesia by analyzing the applicable legal framework. A qualitative normative legal approach was utilized in the research to achieve the study's objective. Data was gathered from primary (legal documents, legislations, laws, case laws, etc.) and secondary (publications, articles) sources. According to the findings, Indonesia has extensive policies, articles, and legal frameworks to inspect and control cyber security breaches and combat cybercrime. However, the formulated laws regarding cybersecurity and combating cybercrime are poorly implemented. The Indonesian government is obligated to anticipate cyber threats by adequately formulating cyber-security policies and identifying comprehensive steps for defending against cyber-attacks, their scale, and types of countermeasures, as well as developing the rule of law necessary to exert proper control over cyber-attacks in Indonesia.
Customer satisfaction plays very important role in online shopping. There is always a drought on what actually drives the customer satisfaction in online shopping. Many studies have been done to understand the customer satisfaction in online shopping, however, as of now, there is no study found that have exactly define the user satisfaction through trust and security. These are the two factors that have been identified as a major barrier in customer's satisfaction in online shopping, especially in the business to consumer B2C e-commerce mode. We also consider the cybercrime as another major barrier to achieve the customer satisfaction in online shopping. Although numerous studies have been conducted which related to the area, there is no satisfactory solution for trust and security in online shopping has been attained, therefore, in order to address this issue, we proposed a research framework that emphasize on trust and security mechanisms to achieve customer's satisfaction. We also show the negative impact of cybercrime on customer trust and satisfaction. In this paper we present the framework that has been designed based on five essential current issues to achieve customer satisfaction in online shopping, which directly impacted the customer's trust. The essential current issues namely are financial security, personal security, system security, privacy and cybercrime.
Recently, the Danish defense department announced that research institutions are prominent targets for cybercrime. To better protect these organizations, an approach to prevent and detect cybercrime in large complex computer networks is needed. This paper contributes by a proof of concept of such an approach, based on a combination of Penetration test (Pen test) and Domain Name System (DNS) analysis. Pen test is a method to assess a network's current security state, by detecting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before they are being abused. On the other hand, DNS traffic analysis can be used to detect ongoing cybercriminal/suspicious activities. The combination of the Pen test and DNS analysis can give an administrator a crucial overview of the vulnerabilities present in the system as well as already compromised parts. The methods were tested on the network of Aalborg University, and they were both able to identify ongoing cybercrime or vulnerabilities. While the feasibility was demonstrated, further developments are needed before it can be implemented on a larger scale.
The study investigates the effects of stock market volatility and cybercrime on cryptocurrency returns in the South African economy. Daily time series data on four different types of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and BMB) were employed. The data covers the period from 1 January 2019-31 December 2021. The study employed the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC GARCH) and Bayesian liner regression model to investigate time-varying correlations among the variables. Empirical findings suggest that stock market volatility has a positive impact on the returns of BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, it has a negative impact on Tether. Expectedly, cybercrime poses negative impacts on the returns of BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum but could be said to have no impact on the returns of Tether. The study concludes that ongoing efforts to reduce cybercrime activities need to be strengthened to further the use of digital currencies.
Advances in technology lead people to a new space called cyberspace. It introduces a radical change in every span of society. Rapid growth of cyberspace leverages the proliferation of cybercrimes. Use of advanced cyber forensic tools gives confidence to the law enforcement agencies for investigating cybercrimes. Digital image forgery is an easy task by using free-of-cost image editing software. So the image-based cybercrimes are also increasing. There are tools and procedures for image forgery detection in digital image forensics. In the case of image as primary evidence in cybercrime, a law enforcement agency has to adopt a legal and procedural framework for their investigation process. This paper aims to propose a model of legal and procedural framework in cybercrime investigation where a digital image is considered as primary evidence. The model is constructed based on Indian laws and regulations.
We consider the analysis of network traffic data for identifying highly agile DNS patterns which are widely considered indicative for cybercrime. In contrast to related approaches, our methodology is capable of explicitly distinguishing between the individual, inherent agility of benign Internet services and criminal sites. Although some benign services use a large number of addresses, they are confined to a subset of IP addresses, due to operational requirements and contractual agreements with certain Content Distribution Networks. We discuss DNSMap, a system which analyzes observed DNS traffic, and continuously learns which FQDNs are hosted on which IP addresses. Any significant changes over time are mapped to bipartite graphs, which are then further pruned for cybercrime activity. Graph analysis enables the detection of transitive relations between FQDNs and IPs, and reveals clusters of malicious FQDNs and IP addresses hosting them. We developed a prototype system which is designed for realtime analysis, requires no costly classifier retraining, and no excessive whitelisting. We evaluate our system using large data sets from an ISP with several 100,000 customers, and demonstrate that even moderately agile criminal sites can be detected reliably and almost immediately.

It has only been recently that fear of crime scholars have shifted their attention to online contexts. The current systematic review provides an overview of available studies on measurement, intensity and determinants of fear of cybercrime. While matters of measurement and conceptualisation has sprung a sizeable and vivid debate in the general fear of crime literature, we aim to scope this debate for the online context by scrutinizing the available knowledge base. At the same time, and by providing an overview of correlates of fear of cybercrime, we aim to provide a fertile ground for theory building specific to the online context. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, yielding a total of 28 relevant studies from a range of (sub)disciplines, using a variety of measures in terms of the particular emotion measured (fear, worry, anxiety) and the type of cybercrime it related to. We find considerable agreement between studies on classic fear of crime indicators such as gender, victimization and risk perception. At the same time, various studies report a relationship between fear of cybercrime and what is termed 'constrained behavior', as outcome measure. Implications of these findings, and future directions for fear of cybercrime research are discussed.
In recent years, content-based cybercrime detection has become a topic of attraction among researchers. Cybercrime has emerged as a money-driven industry with malicious intent towards online social networks. Cyber-criminals aim to manipulate vulnerable areas in cyberspace by playing on human understanding and making a profit. They threaten minors, especially adolescents, who are not adequately overseen while online. To address this issue, there is an urgent need for a robust content-based cybercrime detection framework. The aim of this research work is to explore possible combinations of various preprocessing, feature selection and classification methodologies using the cuckoo search metaheuristic approach. This approach seeks to improve the performance of content-based cybercrime detection system. For the purpose of this research, four publicly available datasets for cyberbullying detection have been utilized for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was then further compared with three recent cyberbullying detection models based on various evaluation parameters. These parameters included precision, recall and f-measure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach outperformed other recent techniques on all the datasets, giving high predictive recall value via tenfold cross-validation.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is widely used in various fields and industries. Cybercrime is a concern of these days, and artificial intelligence is used to detect this type of crime. Crime detection systems generally detect the crime by training from the related data over a period of time, but sometimes some samples in a dataset may have no label. Therefore, in this paper, a method based on semi-supervised neural network is presented regarding crime types detection. As the neural network is a supervised classification system, therefore, this paper presents a pseudo-label method for neural network optimization and develops it to semi-supervised classification. In the proposed method, firstly the dataset is divided into two sections, labelled and unlabelled, and then the trained section is used to estimate the labelling of the unlabelled samples based on pseudo-labels. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the accuracy, Precision and Recall up to 99.83%, 99.83% and 99.83%, respectively.
Currently cybercrime awareness education tends to be generic, which is not useful for certain demographics, such as older adults, who are at a higher risk of victimisation due to their potential unfamiliarity with cyberspace norms and practices. The Cybercrime Awareness Clinic team carried out focus groups and interviews with older adults with the aim of gaining a better understanding of their cybercrime perceptions and experiences. Fifteen older adults over 60 years participated in focus groups or semi-structured interviews and discussed their experiences of using the internet and dealing with cybercrime. The study concluded that older adults have specific cyberawareness resource requirements, which reinforces the need for more tailored prevention and reporting mechanisms. Education in relation to cyber-risks and prevention is crucial, but can only be effective when co-designed with those that are supposed to receive this training in a grassroots way.

Cybercrime activities are supported by infrastructures and services originating from an underground economy. The current understanding of this phenomenon is that the cybercrime economy ought to be fraught with information asymmetry and adverse selection problems. They should make the effects that we observe every day impossible to sustain. In this paper, we show that the market structure and design used by cyber criminals have evolved toward a market design that is similar to legitimate, thriving, online forum markets such as eBay. We illustrate this evolution by comparing the market regulatory mechanisms of two underground forum markets: 1) a failed market for credit cards and other illegal goods and 2) another, extremely active marketplace for vulnerabilities, exploits, and cyber attacks in general. The comparison shows that cybercrime markets evolved from unruly, scam for scammers market mechanisms to mature, regulated mechanisms that greatly favors trade efficiency.
With the popularity of computer and internet, cybercrime is rampant. However, the characteristics of internet making it more difficult to monitor the cybercrime, such as openness anonymity high speed and across localization. In this paper, we propose a new method to prevent cybercrime. Critical Information are taken as important information to monitor burst cybercrime events in massive data. With the detection of characters about critical people and information, we can quickly discover the network crime, and then the government can intervene in time. Therefore, this method can reduce the harm of cybercrime, and the loss of state.
This paper models cybercrime by adding an active victim to the seminal Becker model of crime. The victim invests in security that may protect her from a cybercrime and, if the cybercrime is thwarted, generate evidence that can be used for prosecution. Successful crimes leave insufficient evidence for apprehension and conviction and, thus, cannot be punished. Results show that increased penalties for cybercriminals lead them to exert more effort and make cybercrimes more likely to succeed. Above a threshold they also lead victims to invest less in security. It may be impossible to deter cybercriminals by punishing them. Deterrence is possible, but not necessarily optimal, through punishing victims, such as data controllers or processors that fail to protect their networks.
The paper deals with cybersecurity issues of objects of critical information infrastructures that are essential in the state's defense capability, its economic and social development. The dynamics of cybercrime in Ukraine and the world is analyzed. Ways to improve the protection of the state's critical information infrastructure have been identified.
Purpose Open innovation is important for technology firms as they can use freely available resources to source creative and innovative ideas. Despite the usefulness of open innovation for technological advancements, few studies have focused on the role of cybercrime in affecting an organizations strategic direction. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of open innovation on cybercrime in technology firms. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted on technology firms to understand the role of open innovation in terms of technology scouting, horizontal collaboration and vertical collaboration on cybercrime activity. Findings The study found that there is a dilemma most technology firm's face in having an open innovation strategy and how to manage cybercrime. This means that a coopetition strategy is utilized that helps to not only balance the need to have open innovation but also protect intellectual property. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to link open innovation strategy to cybercrime activity in technology firms. Thus, it contributes to the literature on open innovation and cyber theft and security.
The threat of formal sanctions is the criminal justice system's primary tool to discourage online and offline deviant behavior. Yet, scholars have expressed strong concerns about the effectiveness of formal sanctions to deter cybercrime. Even more surprising is the sparsity of deterrence research in the cybercrime literature. This study examined the effects of perceived formal and informal sanctions on digital piracy, computer hacking, and online harassment in a large American college sample. Perceived formal sanctions was negatively correlated with software piracy, media piracy, password cracking, accessing accounts, sending mean messages privately online, and posting mean messages. Higher levels of perceived formal sanctions did not significantly predict any form of cybercrime, however, when controlling for informal sanctions and deviant peer associations. The implications of the findings for our ability to deter deviant behavior in cyberspace are explored.
Cybercriminals increasingly use sophisticated tools and advanced methods to attack bank systems. This study intends to highlight the cybercrime investigation of ATM heist in Taiwan. A cybercrime investigation framework of bank ATM heist from ISO/IEC 27043: 2015 processes class is proposed to address the issue and to help investigators explore the truth. It describes a prototype framework that is current under development, and demonstrates how ISO/IEC 27043: 2015 processes class can provide investigators with great abilities to interpret data generated by cyber forensics tools.
The advancements and rapid development of the cyber world have not resulted in mere positive effects. The major negative influence observed in the virtual environment is cybercrime. The loss of limits concerning time and space on the internet can influence everything. A cracker/hacker can easily get into a third party's system without legal or authoritative permission. Different nations have implemented cybercrime laws to regulate the control over data safety and the non-breaching of privacy. Indonesia is also one of those countries that are exhibiting cyber-crime ratios to a great degree. As cybercrime is not merely confined to the internet but can also be undertaken through a network that transfers signals such as telephone communication etc. Therefore, the Indonesian government is active towards applying the law as it implements online crime. The present study aims to analyze the application of different common law principles in reducing cybercrime in the country. Through the present research, different laws, principles, and articles have been discussed concerning the cyber-security in Indonesia. Some of the regulations have been implemented in the Penal Code which also includes the UUTE (Law of information and electronic transactions). By incorporating the system, the cases of cybercrime can be decreased in Indonesia.
Cybercriminal activity has exploded in the past decade, with diverse threats ranging from phishing attacks to botnets and drive-by-downloads afflicting millions of computers worldwide. In response, a volunteer defense has emerged, led by security companies, infrastructure operators, and vigilantes. This reactionary force does not concern itself with making proactive upgrades to the cyber infrastructure. Instead, it operates on the front lines by remediating infections as they appear. We construct a model of the abuse reporting infrastructure in order to explain how voluntary action against cybercrime functions today, in hopes of improving our understanding of what works and how to make remediation more effective in the future. We examine the incentives to participate among data contributors, affected resource owners, and intermediaries. Finally, we present a series of key attributes that differ among voluntary actions to investigate further through experimentation, pointing toward a research agenda that could establish causality between interventions and outcomes.
Unprecedented and rapid expansion of ICT has meant it has become a common platform for prospective criminals intending to commit crimes in a non-traditional manner. These new-age crimes are popularly known as cybercrimes in the form of stalking, hacking, cyber obscenity, cyber theft, breach of confidentiality, etc. The rampant growth of IT has pushed the legislators of developing countries like Bangladesh into various challenges and difficulties in moulding new legal regimes to govern the virtual world from multiple types of cyber problems. Now cybercrime in social media is in a state of flux, which not only demands adequate tools to combat this but also requires terminological clarification of particular conduct as cybercrime or not. The paper attempts to depict several sorts of cybercrime in cyberspace, particularly in social media. It also examines existing regulations in light of current issues using data analysis of acquired samples from specific locations to anticipate clever minds of possible cybercriminals.
This qualitative study explores the perspectives and experiences of digital consumers who have been victims of agricultural produce-related digital crimes. This study aims to comprehend how victims experience and deal with the impact of cybercrime, as well as their perceptions of the effectiveness of the legal and criminal justice system in addressing cybercrime, through in-depth interviews with 26 digital consumers of agricultural produce associated with cybercrime from Labone, East Legon, Dzorwulu, Roman Ridge and Cantoments in the Greater Accra Region, Ghana. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Data were processed in NVivo. Based on the study findings, it was concluded that cybercrime victims endured a variety of emotional, psychological, and financial repercussions. Cybercrime has a profound emotional impact on victims with regard to feeling angry, frustrated, or violated. Victims also suffer significant financial losses, which puts them in anguish and financial difficulty. Furthermore, the study concluded that victims of cybercrime have conflicting views on how well civil and criminal justice systems work to combat it. Although some victims think that the judicial system works well for them, others believe it is slow and ineffective, which makes them feel frustrated and helpless. The study recommends the need for more effective support and assistance for victims of cybercrime with respect to digital consumers of agricultural produce. This study underscores the need for greater awareness of cybercrime, as well as more effective and efficient mechanisms for reporting, investigating, and prosecuting cybercrime.
"Healthcare was an early adopter of ICT with the goal of improving physicians' work. The digital revolution of healthcare started several years ago with the introduction of informatics into hospitals. Today healthcare is again at the forefront: as one of the most attacked and promising areas of exploitation for cybercriminals and cyberterrorists due to the abundance of valuable information and for its role in critical infrastructure. Patients' world also changed radically and went through an ICT revolution; nowadays healthcare operators and patients' worlds are highly digitalized, modifying how healthcare operators and patients offer and use services. This chapter, starting from an introduction to the new paradigms of the modern workforces, will introduce the concepts of Hospital 2.0, the patient ecosystem and will explore specific cybercrime and cyberterrorism threats."
In the past decade, online crime has begun to emerge, owing to Bitcoin what was released in 2009 [1], which was an excellent tool for cybercriminals to launder their income from illegal sources. In our research, we investigate the relationship between Bitcoin as cryptocurrency and cybercrime through theoretical examples and real crimes. Besides blockchain - registry and inventory system for the recording, tracking, monitoring, and transacting - various cyber-attack modes are presented, and solution and protection suggestions are also introduced that make the cyberspace more protected.
This article examines the resource sharing functionality of the decryption platform of Europol. The platform supports European law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that are having difficulties accessing legally obtained encrypted evidence due to the lack of human and technical resources. The article investigates Europol's resource transmission role with sharing economy variables such as transaction cost and trust-building. The core argument of the article is that Europol's sharing platform has a strong potential to reduce the transaction cost of outsourcing the decryption services and diminish trust-related problems for national policing agencies by replacing private sector actors. However, for a more sustainable cybercrime investigation strategy, the decryption platform needs a new market-oriented model supported with robust vetting and evidence security mechanisms to encourage more private company participation.
"The new types of cybercrime have different features from traditional cumulative crimes. The application of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law has run into difficulties, and the relevant theoretical explanations of substantive preparatory crime and being an accomplice in crime find it hard to achieve self-consistency. Legislation on the new types of cybercrime is a legitimate response to recent changes in this area. Utilizing the particular techniques of cybercrime and the circumstantial requirement of limiting the amount of criminal harm is the key to satisfying the conditions for offences warranting criminal punishment. The harmfulness of the new types of cybercrime is not great; the law's circumstantial requirements are flexible, and the criteria for judicial application are unclear, so the law's provisions are seldom invoked and the sphere of criminal activity is unduly expanded. In order to give full play to the effectiveness of this legislation, we should formulate reasonable judicial rules that accord with the constitution of cybercrimes, narrow down the constituent elements of such crimes in a reasonable way, and categorize and limit the interpretation of circumstantial requirements."
Through an inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with experts, this study corroborates key findings on contextual and organisational dynamics behind profit-driven cybercrime. The findings pinpoint three contextual factors influencing individuals to participate in profit-driven cybercrime: lack of legal economic opportunities, lack of deterrents, and drifting means. The findings also highlight how experts perceive group structures of those behind profit-driven cybercrime: as organised, enterprise-like, loose networks, or communities. Experts' narratives, moreover, emphasise the presence of a workforce at the periphery of cybercrime groups. Such a workforce is not actively involved in developing criminal schemes, yet it helps their orchestration by achieving necessary tasks such as writing texts or developing software. The study results confirm key insights on crime participation related to both cyber and non-cybercrime literature while also raising new research avenues, including questions concerning to what extent those forming the peripheral workforce are willing to participate in cybercrime.
This article presents the first study on post-conviction polygraphy in the Netherlands. Importantly, it exclusively focuses on cybercrime offenders. The study is designed to systematically address the different child sexual behaviours exhibited by 25 participants who are in treatment for possessing child abuse images. The results indicate that post-conviction polygraphy can provide additional data to inform the development of theory in this area and contribute to the treatment, supervision, and more effective containment of offending behaviour and the reduction of future victimization.
Research examining the illicit online market for cybercrime services operating via web forums, such as malicious software, personal information, and hacking tools, has greatly improved our understanding of the practices of buyers and sellers, and the social forces that structure actor behavior. The majority of these studies are based on open markets, which can be accessed by anyone with minimal barriers to entry. There are, however, closed communities operating online that are thought to operate with greater trust and reliability between participants, as they must be vetted and approved by existing community members. The decision to allow individuals to join a forum may reflect restrictive deterrence practices on the part of existing members, as those applicants may threaten the security or operations of the group. This study utilized a quantitative analysis to understand the factors associated with rejection for individuals who sought membership in the organized and sophisticated closed forum run by and for cybercriminals called Darkode. The findings demonstrated that individuals whose perceived engagement with the hacker community and cybercrime marketplace were considered too risky for membership. The implications of this study for our understanding of restrictive deterrence theory, as well as criminal market operations on and offline were explored in depth.
Cybersecurity is one of the most significant concerns of life in the 21st century and safeguarding information systems is an arduous task for governments and companies across the globe. The tremendous growth in wireless communication and extensive usage of cyberspace has weakened privacy. Eventually, cybercrime has become the substantial threat to all the organizations in the world because of its devastating implications on diverse sectors associated to human. This paper explores few impacts of cybercrime to understand the intensity of damage it can cause. Besides, Qatar is taken as a case study to emphasize the exigency of securing cyberspace. The contribution of this work identifies the past cyber-attacks in Qatar to generate consciousness and to trigger actions for improving national security. The recent major cyber-attack on Qatar News Agency which led to catastrophic results and threatened Qatar's diplomacy is also outlined along with the critical challenges that are being faced by the security of Qatar. As cybercrime crosses borders of all nations, this paper emphasizes the need for global response to curb it. Additionally, it delineates the fact that attacks in cyberspace are not just driven by financial gain, but by politics or disinformation to denigrate and cause emotional harm.
It is widely accepted that technology is an agent of change in the society. If used properly, it can increase productivity and improve our quality of life. However, the current rate of change in technology leaves room for it to be exploited and be used for things it was not meant to do. This includes criminal activities which are carried using technology on the cyberspace that can be classified as cybercrime. Cybercrime or computer crime can be defined as a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are a tool, a target or a place of criminal activity. Cybercrime can also be defined as the leveraging of information systems and technology to commit larceny, extortion, identity theft, fraud and, in some cases, corporate espionage. In this chapter, we explore the challenges of combating cybercrime given its dynamic, pervasive and international nature. We examine in detail the technical, social and legal factors that are continually shaping the landscape of cybercrime. Further, the chapter consolidates research and practical work in the area of cybercrime, emerging perspectives, paradigms and trends. A deliberate effort is made in making sure that the role of underground economy is clearly spelled out and its contribution to cybercrime is analysed. The impact of new laws which are being quickly enacted without much thought, discussion on the regulatory framework for combating cybercrime and ethical dimension of cybercrime given its global nature are examined. This chapter is expected to stimulate constructive discussions on novel ways of mitigating and promoting research in cybercrime.
The dependence of information societies on the availability of Internet service as well as successful attacks against critical information infrastructures has led to an increasing discussion about strategies to respond to terrorist use of the Internet and cybercrime. Very frequently a comprehensive approach is identified as an adequate response. The following article provides an overview about the necessary components of such approach and puts them into context.
Big data and cybercrime are creating 'upstream', big data related cyber-dependent crimes such as data breaches. They are essential components in a cybercrime chain which forms a cybercrime ecosystem that cascades 'downstream' to give rise to further crimes, such as fraud, extortion, etc., where the data is subsequently monetized. These downstream crimes have a massive impact upon victims and data subjects. The upstream and downstream crimes are often committed by entirely different offending actors against different victim groups, which complicates and frustrates the reporting, recording, investigative and prosecution processes. Taken together the crime stream's cascade effect creates unprecedented societal challenges that need addressing in the face of the advances of AI and the IoT. This phenomenon is explored here by unpacking the TalkTalk case study to conceptualize how big data and cloud computing are creating cascading effects of disorganized, distributed and escalating data crime. As part of the larger CRITiCal project, the paper also hypothesizes key factors triggering the cascade effect and suggests a methodology to further investigate and understand it.
It is increasingly argued that the primary motive of the cybercriminal and the major reason for the continued growth in cyber attacks is financial gain. In addition to the direct financial impact of cybercrime, it can also be argued that the digital data and the information it represents that can be communicated through the Internet, can have additional intrinsic value to the cybercriminal. In response to the perceived value and subsequent demand for illicit data, a sophisticated and self-sufficient underground digital economy has emerged. The aim of this paper is to extend the author's earlier research that first introduced the concept of the Cybercrime Execution Stack by examining in detail the underlying data objectives of the cybercriminal. Both technical and non-technical law enforcement investigators need the ability to contextualise and structure the illicit activities of the cybercriminal, in order to communicate this understanding amongst the wider law enforcement community. By identifying the potential value of electronic data to the cybercriminal, and discussing this data in the context of data collection, data supply and distribution, and data use, demonstrates the relevance and advantages of utilising an objective data perspective when investigating cybercrime.

The research paper deals with the search for practical means of enhancing the functional and organizational capabilities of the security police in combating cybercrime. The research paper separately examines the influence of municipal security police on the cybercrime combating system. It also reveals the interaction of the municipal police with the system of national police authorities. The conclusion is that there is a need to introduce municipal security police in Ukraine to increase the flexibility and mobility of law enforcement agencies in responding to cybercrime, and to enhance the level of protection of municipal property that may be targeted by cybercrimes.
Purpose The use of computer technology to commit cyber laundering increases their social danger, creates new ways to commit cyber laundering, causes the masking of traces of cyber laundering and expands the geography of cyber laundering, while eliminating traditional state borders. That is why, the researched problems have a high level of relevance. The purpose of this research is to promote the spread of international standards in the field of combating money laundering, as well as an analysis of the mechanisms of money laundering obtained from cybercrime. Design/methodology/approach The leading methods that were used in the article for the purpose of conducting research were a number of general scientific methods, such as analysis and synthesis, deduction, induction, forecasting, modeling, analogy and a number of special methods of study and cognition, which include comparative legal, historical legal, formal legal and structural functional methods. Findings The main results prospects for further research and the applied value of the material. Large-scale cyber laundering of illegal income has long become a global problem that requires a solution from all states of the world, which means that these problems can only be overcome through active interstate cooperation. Originality/value The article analyzes inter alia the international legislation in the field of money laundering mechanisms obtained from cybercrime and examines the activities of international organizations in this area.
"The following chapter provides an in depth look at a broad selection challenges related to Cybercrime and Cyberterrorism, as identified through prolonged engagement with a multitude of horizontal and vertical cyber-security stakeholders. Out of six critical areas identified, the two leading causes, were through the evolving rate of technology, and, the subsequent lack of education, awareness and training. These two underlying factors further influenced and affected the severity of the additional four critical areas; the capability of investigators, cooperation and information sharing, legislative systems and data protection, and, organisational and societal resilience. Through the consultation and elicitation of information from over 90 individual domain experts, practitioners and security stakeholders, the research of this chapter is dedicated towards improving international awareness towards leading threats, vulnerabilities, and challenges to the continually evolving sphere of cybersecurity."
Research has established that individuals lower in self-control are at increased risk of offline criminal victimization due to their proclivity to engage in risky routine activities. While some studies have investigated whether a similar pattern is observed in the online context, additional inquiry into whether the link between low self-control and cybercrime victimization operates indirectly through risky online behavior is warranted given certain measurement and methodological limitations of prior research. Using original data collected on a sample of young adults, we find that the association between low self-control and a variety measure of cybercrime victimization operates entirely and indirectly through a variety measure of risky online behaviors. The implications of this finding for policy and programing are discussed.
Countries have employed the Internet proxy as a censorship mechanism for various reasons. Concurrently, cyber criminal activities continue to rise. This research explores peoples' engagement in bypassing the Internet proxy and if it is related to cyber criminal engagement. Through an experimental design, participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Using manipulation paragraphs, in the first group (Group 1), a positive view on the Internet proxy was presented. In the second group (Group 2), a negative view on the Internet proxy was presented. The third group (Group 3) was used as the control group, where the participants' view of the Internet proxy was not manipulated. All three groups were asked to self-report their rate of proxy bypass (SRPBE) and cybercrime engagement (CCI). The results indicated a significant positive correlation between self-reported cyber criminal engagement and self-reported proxy bypass engagement. The results also showed that individuals with more knowledge in computers are more likely to bypass the Internet proxy. However, individuals with better knowledge in computers are not necessarily the ones that are more likely to commit cyber criminal activities. The results were inconclusive on whether or not the manipulation paragraphs used had an effect on the participants' view of the Internet Proxy.
"Under what conditions is the Internet more likely to be used maliciously for criminal activity? This study examines the conditions under which the Internet is associated with cybercriminal offenses. Using comprehensive state-level data in the United States during 2004-2010, our findings show that there is no clear empirical evidence that the Internet penetration rate is related to the number of Internet crime perpetrators; however, cybercriminal activities are contingent upon socioeconomic factors and connection speed. Specifically, a higher income, more education, a lower poverty rate, and a higher inequality are likely to make the Internet penetration be more positively related with cybercrime perpetrators, which are indeed different from the conditions of terrestrial crime in the real world. In addition, as opposed to narrowband, the broad-band connections are significantly and positively associated with the number of Internet crime perpetrators, and it amplifies the aforementioned moderating effects of socioeconomic status on Internet crime offenses. Taken together, cybercrime requires more than just a skilled perpetrator, and it requires an infrastructure to facilitate profiteering from the act."
At present, cybercrime has become a serious phenomenon. It not only leads to the harm for the society, but also leads to the challenge for the academic circle. So it is very important for the university to develop a related curriculum and train students to deal with it. East China University of Political Science and Law has set up a curriculum named as cyber-crime and computer forensics for eight years. Usually, the students who are liberal arts majors are short of computer science knowledge. The author overcomes the difficulty and gets great achievement. Thus, the curriculum has been supported by the university as the undergraduate construction course in 2016. The teaching experience will be written in the teaching material in 2018.
The widespread use of the Internet and cyberspace has allowed the development of new criminal forms of transnational nature that harm patrimonial as well as personal interests of users. Even more, these crimes could affect collective interests if they are based on attacks with a background of cyber racism or cyberterrorism. The current study provides a variety of topics such as the phenomenological characterization of cybercrime in Ecuador, the analysis of information related to the country obtained from national and international organizations, the determination of its growth and incidence. These results have been organized in order to be compatible and interrelated also with other demographic and economic data. One of the main targets of the outcome of this study has been to consider the analysis in the combat of the corresponding scourge in a systematic and structured way, so that legislators and planners of the national cybersecurity policy may be provided with a powerful database and tool for activities in a higher, strategic level. Furthermore, this analysis may be applied to other countries in the region that experience similar realities.
This study aims to analyze the importance of strengthening legal concepts in overcoming cybercrime during the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The Covid-19 pandemic that hit Indonesia made some people lose many things in various aspects of their lives due to multiple types of cybercrimes that often occur in society, such as malware attacks, trojan activities, and information leaks. The Electronic Information and Transactions Law (ITE) Number 11 of 2008 and the revised version of the ITE Law Number 19 of 2016 have historically been the legal basis for regulating cyber security in Indonesia. However, this regulation does not include essential parts of cybersecurity such as information and network infrastructure and human resources with cybersecurity experience. Thus, it is necessary to know how important it is to strengthen legal concepts in overcoming cybercrime during the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This study uses a qualitative approach. The data sources are from various online news media and relevant research journals and analyzed using the NVivo12 Plus application. Based on the results of the analysis, this study found that the acceleration of the ratification of the Personal Data Protection Bill, the establishment of special regulations related to cybersecurity and cybercrime, the creation of a multi-sectoral cyber security management ecosystem, as well as increasing awareness and capacity of human resources in the cyber security sector are alternative policies that must be considered and realized to strengthen the concept of law in overcoming various cyber crimes during the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia.
The growing prevalence of cybercrime, particularly among young adults, necessitates the promotion of digital citizenship to educate students about responsible online behavior and to equip them with the skills to mitigate cyber risks. The specific objective of this study was to investigate the effect of digital citizenship skills on the prevention of cybercrime among higher education students. A mixed-method approach, including surveys and interviews, was employed to collect data from 652 students in Saudi Arabia. This study found that digital citizenship generally has a significant impact on students' awareness and prevention of cybercrime through the development of responsible online behavior. Knowledge of digital law came first, followed by beliefs about digital manners. Digital communication skills came third, followed by digital rights, knowledge, and duties in fourth place. Then, digital commerce skills and digital health beliefs came fifth and sixth, respectively. This was followed by digital access skills, then digital security, and finally digital culture. The results also revealed a negative statistical relationship between digital citizenship and cybercrimes' various forms including national, financial, banking, social, immoral, insulting, slanderous, defaming, threatening, and harassment in virtual learning environments. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of how higher education institutions can promote digital citizenship and prevent cybercrime by integrating digital citizenship education into their curriculum, providing training for educators, and establishing clear policies and guidelines for responsible online behavior.
"Darknet drug market participants must complete a distinct cybercrime script if they are to successfully procure illicit substances online. This paper details the four generic stages (i.e. Informational Accumulation; Account Formation; Market Exchange; Delivery/Receipt) of a novel cybercrime script for Darknet drug markets. It also presents vignette examples of known law enforcement interventions that have effectively targeted each stage of the script to reduce usage of these marketplaces. While law enforcement interventions to close specific Darknet markets tend to have only short-lived effects on levels of illicit activity, the lens of the cryptomarket crime script highlights numerous additional steps beyond closure that law enforcement can effectively undertake to reduce use of these platforms."
"The increased of cybercrime incidents taking place in the world is at its perilous magnitude causing losses in term of money and trust. Even though there are various cybersecurity solutions in place; the threat of cybercrime is still a hard problem. Exploration of cybercrime challenges, especially the preventions and detections of the cybercrime should be investigated by composing all the stakeholders and players of a cybercrime issue. In this paper; an exploration of several cybercrime stakeholders is done. It is argued that cybercrime is a systemic threat and cannot be tackled with cybersecurity and legal systems. The architectural model proposed is significant and should become one of the considered milestones in designing security control in tackling cybercrime globally. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of STAIDCC20 workshop is to bring together a mixture of inter-disciplinary researchers and practitioners working in defence, cybercrime and cybersecurity application areas to discuss and explore the challenges and future research directions around socio-technical AI systems. The workshop will showcase where the state of the art is in socio-technical AI, charting a path around issues including transparency, trustworthiness, explaining bias and error, incorporating human judgment and ethical frameworks for deployment of socio-technical AI in the future.
"The Response Time Concealed Information Test (RT-CIT) can reveal that a person recognises a relevant item (e.g., a murder weapon) among other control items, based on slower responses to the former compared to the latter ones. To date, the RT-CIT has been predominantly examined only in the context of scenarios that are very unlikely in real life, while sporadic assessment has shown that it suffers from low diagnostic accuracy in more realistic scenarios. In our study, we validated the RT-CIT in the new, realistic, and very topical mock scenario of a cybercrime (Study 1, n = 614; Study 2; n = 553), finding significant though moderate effects. At the same time (and expanded with a concealed identity scenario; Study 3, n = 250), we assessed the validity and generalizability of the filler items presented in the RT-CIT: We found similar diagnostic accuracies when using specific, generic, and even nonverbal items. However, the relatively low diagnostic accuracy in case of the cybercrime scenario reemphasizes the importance of assessments in realistic scenarios as well as the need for further improving the RT-CIT."
With the growing sophistication and use of information technology, the past decade has witnessed a major growth in financial cybercrime. This paper focuses specifically on credit card fraud and identity theft, examining the globalisation of these activities within a 'digital ecosystem' conceptual framework. The relevance of concepts and analytical tools typically used to study legitimate businesses, such as value chains, dynamic capabilities and business models, is explored and tested for their relevance in understanding the scale and nature of illegal activities which are dependant upon innovation and the collective activities of global participants. It is argued that developing a better understanding of how such illegal activities are organised and operate will assist policy makers, law enforcement agencies and security firms to identify trends and concentrate limited resources in a most effective manner.

In this paper, we propose a network economic model of cybercrime with a focus on financial services, since such organizations are one of the principal targets of such illicit activity. This multiproduct model is constructed as a layered bipartite network with supply price, transaction cost, and demand price functions linking the networks. A novelty of the new model is the incorporation of average time associated with illicit product delivery at the demand markets with the demand price functions being decreasing functions of such times, as noted in reality. The governing equilibrium conditions are formulated as a variational inequality problem with qualitative properties of the solution presented. An algorithm, with nice features for computations, is then applied to two sets of numerical examples in order to illustrate the model and computational procedure as well as the types of interventions that can be investigated from a policy perspective to make it more difficult for cybercriminals to obtain sensitive data.
"Cybercrime has increased significantly, recently, as a result of both individual and group criminal practice, and is now a threat to individuals, organisations, and democratic systems worldwide. However, cybercrime raises two main challenges for legal systems: firstly, because cybercriminals operate online, cybercrime spans beyond the boundaries of specific jurisdictions, which constrains the operation of the police and, subsequently, the conviction of the perpetrators; secondly, since cybercriminals can operate from anywhere in the world, law enforcement agencies struggle to identify the origin of the communications, especially when obfuscation strategies are used, e.g. dark web fora. Nevertheless, cybercriminals inherently use language to communicate, so the linguistic analysis of suspect communications is particularly helpful in deterring cybercriminal practice. This article reports the potential of forensic translation in the fight against cybercrime. Although the term 'forensic translation' is typically understood as a synonym of 'legal translation', it is argued that the implications of forensic translation span beyond those of legal translation, to include analyses of language rights, of the right to interpretation and translation in legal procedures (in the EU), or even investigative and intelligence practices. Translation is a pervasive activity that is conducted, not only by professional translators, but also by lay speakers of language, often using machine translation systems. The ease of use of the latter makes it particularly suitable for cross-border criminal (e.g. extortion or fraud) and cybercriminal communications (e.g. cybertrespass, cyberfraud, cyberpiracy, cyberporn or child online porn, cyberviolence or cyberstalking). This article presents the results of the analysis of cybercriminal communications from a forensic translation perspective. It demonstrates that translation is frequently used to spread cybercriminal communications, and that reverse-engineering the translational procedure will assist law enforcement agencies in narrowing down their pool of suspects and, consequently, deter cybercriminal threats."
The article studies the discourse and a legal uncertainty of the popular and generally understandable concept of cybercrime. The authors reveal the doctrinal approaches to the definition of cybercrime, cyberspace, computer crime. The analysis of international legal acts and legislation of Ukraine in fighting cybercrime is carried out. The conclusion is made about the need to improve national legislation and establish international cooperation to develop the tools for countering cybercrime and minimizing its negative outcomes. The phenomenon of nicknames is studied as a semantic source, which potentially generates a number of threats and troubles - the crisis of traditional anthroponymic culture, identity crisis, hidden sociality, and indefinite institutionalization, incognito style, a range of manifestations of loneliness - from voluntary solitude to traumatic isolation and forced detachment. The core idea is that it is the phenomenon of incognito and hidden name (nickname and other alternatives) that is the motivational stimulus for the fact of information trouble or crime.
With the increased usage of the internet and innovative technological innovations, hacking another person's system or electronic devices has become easier. Technology on one hand is beneficial for making lives easier but also exerts threats in the form of many issues such as bullying and cyber-crimes. Cybercrime and bullying have increased significantly in Indonesia in the last few years. The present study has reviewed the rules and legislations implemented in Indonesia against the prevailing problems of cybercrime and bullying. So, the research aims to explore the common laws and approaches to addressing cybercrime and bullying of adolescents in Indonesia. In Indonesia bullying, as a criminal act is regulated under the Child protection act, ITE Law and KUP. And cybercrime is regulated under Law Number 11 in 2008. Results provide valuable insights and a detailed review of laws and activities relevant to the issue under discussion. The present study holds greater theoretical and practical importance as this study is a valuable addition to the growing body of literature regarding cybercrime and bullying in Indonesia. Furthermore, the regulatory bodies of Indonesia can also gain insights from the study by focusing on required amendments to cater to the prevailing problems in a better way in the country.
This chapter describes the fight against cybercrime from a European perspective. Law enforcement agencies always have had an important role when it comes to fighting crime. However, in this digital era, several problems hamper the effectiveness of the police combating crime. Therefore, the first part of this chapter describes the difficulties the police have in fighting cybercrime. The second part of the chapter focuses on one of the strategies to overcome some of these difficulties, namely forming alliances with private institutes. This joint-up approach is mostly realized by public-private partnerships (PPPs), consisting of formalized cooperation between governmental authorities and important stakeholders. Cooperation between governmental and private actors is no sinecure, as will appear from a public administration perspective. Successful cooperation depends on several factors, which will be theoretically described and practically illustrated. Conclusively, the discussion paragraph handles the common dilemma of the extent to which the government should play a leading role in the fight against (cyber) crime.
"The wealth of beneficial tools for online interaction, consumption, and access to others also bring new risks for harmful experiences online. This study examines the association between cybercrime victimization and subjective well-being (SWB) and, based on the buffering effect hypothesis, tests the assumption of the protective function of social belonging in cybercrime victimization. Cross-national data from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland (N=3,557; Internet users aged 15-30 years; 49.85 percent female) were analyzed using descriptive statistics and main and moderation effect models. Results show that cybercrime victimization has a negative association with SWB after adjusting for a number of confounding factors. This association concerns both general cybercrime victimization and subcategories such as victimization to offensive cybercrime and cyberfraud. In line with the buffering effect hypothesis, social belonging to offline groups was shown to moderate the negative association between SWB and cybercrime victimization. The same effect was not found in the social belonging to online groups. Overall, the study indicates that, analogously to crime victimization in the offline context, cybercrime is a harmful experience whose negative effects mainly concern those users who have weak social ties offline to aid in coping with such stressors."
"The Dark Web or DarkNet has attracted both considerable media and scholarly attention. This forms part of a broader tradition of analyzing relatively open cybercriminal marketplaces and forums. With the aid of data collected over a 7-year period, the focus of this paper is to help demarcate beyond the Dark Web alone - all the layers within the world of profit-driven cybercrime. These include: 1) the top layer, which is the most open forums and marketplaces, whether Dark Web or otherwise; 2) the middle layer of more closely vetted forums; 3) the bottom layer of even smaller and more closed groupings; 4) the molten core, which is centered on the offline organization of cybercrime. The purpose of this analysis is to identify key aspects of the underground economy which warrant further scholarly attention, and to suggest possible approaches to engage with these subjects going forward."
Cyber threats have increased in Iraq with the introduction of new technologies. This study aimed to investigate the cyber security measures currently in place in Iraq and understand how predictive models can be adopted to investigate cybercrimes in Iraq. The study used a descriptive and explorative approach, with Literature review and documentation research as main data collection instruments. In a meta-review of past studies, the cybersecurity risks prevalent in Iraq were identified and explored whether predictive models can be used to eliminate cybercrimes. The study analyzed how predictive analytics proved a potential security application and assisted the law enforcement agencies to cope up with cybercrimes against national security. While the study also encountered the frailty and vulnerability of cybersecurity in Iraq, it identified the benefits of Predictive AI models. The study concluded that Iraq needs an early warning system that can address to the cybercrime issues, reduce vulnerabilities, disseminate general cybersecurity best practices. The Iraqi government can also enact new cyber security laws and comply with the national and international norms. The study implies that predictive analytics models can best suit the needs of Iraq. It has been note significantly that each PA model is strong enough to optimize itself according to the required needs.
Fear of crime research tends to focus disproportionately on physical or place-based crimes while cybercrimes, which have been increasing over the past two decades, are relatively excluded. Drawing on Beck's theory of a risk society, this paper examines the impact of previous victimization experiences on fear of future encounters with cybercrime. A total 01 462 students at the University of Saskatchewan participated in an online survey that collected demographic information and asked if they had ever felt fearful about being the victim of credit/debit card fraud. Binary logistic regression was used to predict fear of cybercrime victimization. Prior experience of victimization was positively associated with students' fear of becoming victims of credit/debit card fraud Socio-demographic factors and knowledge of cybercrime were not significant predictors of students' fear of becoming victims of credit/debit card fraud. This study highlights the need to reconsider risks and examine reflexivity further as it relates to how people modify their behaviors when faced with the threat of cybercriminal victimization. This study also highlights the need for fear of crime research, and vicurnology in general, to consider the unique differences between the different crime forms conventional and cyber-based crimes.
In this paper, we estimate the impact of enforcing the Convention on Cybercrime (COC) on deterring distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. Our data set comprises a sample of real, random spoof-source DDOS attacks recorded in 106 countries in 177 days in the period 2004-2008. We find that enforcing the COC decreases DDOS attacks by at least 11.8 percent, but a similar deterrence effect does not exist if the enforcing countries make a reservation on international cooperation. We also find evidence of network and displacement effects in COC enforcement. Our findings imply attackers in cyberspace are rational, motivated by economic incentives, and strategic in choosing attack targets. We draw related implications.
In the context of increasing interest in the relationship between digital communications and authoritarian politics, this paper considers the criminalisation of online dissent in Tanzania. Based on interviews with police officers, local government officials and mobile phone users, the paper explores contested framings and understandings of cybercrime. It argues that contemporary repression of online freedoms can be understood within longer histories of social and political ordering, whereby understandings and experiences of security and development, and the relationships they imply between government and citizens, are implicated in the delegitimisation of dissent. However, it also finds that social media use enables and amplifies articulation of opposition to repressive measures and may destabilise the politics of security and development that inform the policing of online spaces and politics more broadly. The paper thus contributes, firstly, to understanding the ambiguous and contingent relationships between information and communications technologies and politics in particular places. Secondly, by analysing debates about internet freedom it offers insights into broader negotiations over politics, security and development, which are in turn rendered more urgent by the disruptive impact of new modes of communication.
Cybercrime firms (CCFs) have significant global outreach. Combining insights from theories on white-collar crime (WCC), international relations (IR)/international political economy (IPE) perspectives, export market selection process, and market failures, we analyze CCFs' operations and internationalization. We present research findings from multiple case studies of CCFs to interrogate the above theories and to refine, extend and further develop their arguments. Extending WCC theory, resource constraints in countries with weak rule of laws result law enforcement apparatus' inability to cope. The IR/IPE provides additional insights by explicating mechanisms by which an economy's international integration can drive investments law enforcement resources. It explains the stages associated with CCFs' export market selection processes. Finally, we view that CCFs make excess/supranormal profits, for which market failure is necessary.
The COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered life, killing hundreds of thousands of people and leading many countries to issue stay-at-home orders to contain the virus's spread. Based on insights from routine activity theory (Cohen & Felson 1979), it is likely that COVID-19 will influence victimization rates as people alter their routines and spend more time at home and less time in public. Yet, the pandemic may affect victimization differently depending on the type of crime as street crimes appear to be decreasing while domestic crimes may be increasing. We consider a third type of crime: cybercrime. Treating the pandemic as a natural experiment, we investigate how the pandemic has affected rates of cybervictimization. We compare pre-pandemic rates of victimization with post-pandemic rates of victimization using datasets designed to track cybercrime. After considering how the pandemic may alter routines and affect cybervictimization, we find that the pandemic has not radically altered cyberroutines nor changed cybervictimization rates. However, a model using routine activity theory to predict cybervictimization offers clear support for the theory's efficacy both before and after the pandemic. We conclude by considering plausible explanations for our findings.
Purpose The evolution of digital technology has changed the way in which we, as a global society, socialise and conduct business. This growth has led to an increasing reliance on technology, much more interconnectedness and in turn, an expansion of criminal opportunities, known now as cybercrime. This study aims to explore the experience of victimisation, perceptions of cybercrime and use of online crime prevention strategies. Design/methodology/approach The study involved a survey of a representative sample of the adult Australian population. The study sample was made up of 595 Australian adult participants. The study seeks to better understand how previous victimisation, perception of cybercrime prevalence and perception of harm caused by cybercrime are related to the use of online crime prevention strategies. It seeks to contribute to a body of work that has found that crime prevention education focused on increasing knowledge is limited in its effectiveness in reducing victimisation. Findings This study identifies key levers, in particular perceived prevalence and harm of cybercrime, as critical in the use of online crime prevention strategies by potential victims. Originality/value The research takes a different perspective from much of the previous research, seeking to better understand how attitudinal factors (perceived prevalence of cybercrime and perceived harm of cybercrime) might motivate or influence the use of online crime prevention strategies by potential victims.
The advent of cloud computing has led to a dispersal of user data across international borders. More than ever before, law enforcement investigations into cybercrime and online criminal activity require cooperation between agencies from multiple countries. This paper examines recent changes to the law in Australia in relation to the power of law enforcement agencies to effectively investigate cybercrime insofar as individuals and organisations make use of cloud infrastructure in connection with criminal activity. It concludes that effective law enforcement operations in this area require harmonious laws across jurisdictions and streamlines procedures for granting assistance between law enforcement agencies. In conjunction with these mechanical developments, this paper posits that law enforcement officers require a systematised understanding of cloud infrastructure and its operation in order to effectively make use of their powers.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop the theorisation of cybercrime in the context of the pandemic, and to sketch out a vision of how law enforcement might respond to a transformed landscape of online crime and offending. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper draws on empirical evidence from a range of sources (including official statistics) and the existing research literature, and revisits routine activities theory to illuminate the way that cybercrime patterns are being transformed by the pandemic. Findings - The pandemic is reshaping the routine activities of societies en masse, leading to changes in the ecology of risk and opportunity for cybercrime. There is evidence of a large increase in the prevalence of cybercrime as a result, yet much of this has a paradoxically local character. Practical implications - The authors identify specific practical implications for law enforcement, namely, that the role of local police in policing cybercrime should be re-envisioned, with a democratic, community-oriented approach at its heart. Originality/value - The theoretical perspective outlined is a novel and critical development of a well-established framework, opening up new paths to the theorisation of cybercrime and cybercrime policing. The authors' suggestions for practitioners have the potential for direct impact, both at the level of practice and in terms of broader imaginaries and organisation of police and policing.
Many cybercriminal entrepreneurs lack the skills and techniques to provision certain parts of their business model, leading them to outsource these parts to specialized criminal vendors. Online anonymous markets, from Silk Road to AlphaBay, have been used to search for these products and contract with their criminal vendors. While one listing of a product generates high sales numbers, another identical listing fails to sell. In this paper, we investigate which factors determine the performance of cybercrime products. To answer this question, we analyze scraped data on the business-to-business cybercrime segments of AlphaBay (2015-2017), consisting of 7,543 listings from 1,339 vendors, sold at least 126,934 times. We construct new variables to capture product differentiators and price. We capture the influence of vendor characteristics by identifying five distinct vendor profiles based on latent profile analysis of six properties. We leverage these product and vendor characteristics to empirically predict the performance of cybercrime products, whilst controlling for the lifespan and type of solution. Consistent with earlier insights into carding forums, we identify prevalent product differentiators to be influencing the relative success of a product. While all these product differentiators do correlate significantly with product performance, their explanatory power is lower than that of vendor profiles. When outsourcing, the vendor seems to be of more importance to the buyers than product differentiators.
The large scale Internet penetration in processes and activities, from manufacturing to end users, has reinforced the time-invariant pillars of cybercrime, namely social engineering, and software vulnerability, e.g., respectively, ransomware and bugs in banking software. Both these pillars spin off two dichotomous results: the goal is an economic profit for the author or confidential information steal/damage of the target of the attack (e.g. to critical infrastructures). Moreover, enabling technologies for anonymity facilitate the progressive shift of criminal markets on the Internet, as TOR marketplaces and cryptocurrencies show, raising the costs of successful investigation. These phenomena can be carried out by isolated criminals, by serious organized criminals or, mostly, from organized crime benefitting from the Crime as a Service (CaaS) model. Hence only apparently cybercrimes , e.g. digital frauds, are not connected to serious criminal organizations, in particular, terrorism, using these activities to fund the core mission. Cybercrime attractiveness, in terms of expected revenues per action, drives the choice of the organized crime, impacting on its willingness to pay in the CaaS model. This paper, firstly, will explore the economic value of cybercrime, overviewing the revenues from different online crimes in the past, highlighting the most attractive, then will overview the potential targets of terrorism enabled by the adoption of new technologies.
Data driven government has become significant in the quest for quality service delivery in the public sector. Countries all over the world are now using Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to enhance the quality of their governance. ICTs have been found to improve efficiency and effectiveness of public administration and enhance citizens access to government services, hence, improvement of the quality of governance. The increasing development of ICTs however, presents new and emerging threats for government to contend with. The issue of cybercrime has become a critical factor in digital government practice in recent times. The internet which provides free access to information has also led to the abuse of technology in perpetrating crimes capable of undermining a nations security. This study examines the implications of cybercrimes on the implementation digital government in Nigerias public sector. The paper makes use of qualitative secondary data gathered from publications of peer reviewed journals and international bodies, books, internet materials to interrogate the implication of cybercrimes in Nigerias quest for digital government adoption. Data gathered were analysed through a systematic literature review with the Routine Activity theory serving as the theoretical framework. Findings of the study reveal the great threat that the increasing spate of cybercrimes pose for digital government implementation in the Nigeria public sector. The paper argues for a data driven government in Nigeria and the political will for its implementation and as well, a vigorous public awareness campaign and decisive application of cyber laws in the country.
Cyber offenders spread their influence as fast as the Internet and cloud computing develop. Cloud computing enhances challenges in collecting and analyzing digital evidence in a cybercrime investigation. Research on cloud storage forensics is scarce to obtain evidence or analyze metadata. This study proposes a time-based investigation in a complex cloud environment. Establishing timeline information using date-time stamps could help when the law enforcement agents investigate cloud-related crime. Some experiments are observed from three users (creator, coauthor and browser), four computers and five file operation processes (file created, file accessed, file modified, file shared, and file downloaded). This study presents a novel cybercrime investigation countermeasure using a created-accessed-modified (CAM) model to improve the effectiveness of forensic analysis. This may have implications when examiners analyze hard disks or when a user has synchronized files from a cloud account prior to computer seizure. The countermeasure methodology is potentially useful for evidentiary datasets and investigations.
"This article examines the challenges of functional adaptation faced by the police in response to technologically driven changes in the nature of crime. It also recounts how research under the auspices of a 'dark web' research project resulted in a search for an effective approach to engaging with investigators dealing with cybercrime. In doing so it tested, as a research methodology, a standard change implementation tool (problem tree analysis) from the Disaster Management and Sustainable Development (DMSD) discipline. This in turn resulted in significant consideration being given to the physical space in which that methodology is used. It presents the results of a workshop held with cybercrime investigators (not all were police officers) in terms of the importance of four key organisational and cultural issues (management, leadership and institutional ethos within the police; the risks of over-complication and exaggerated distinctions between cyber and real world policing; ethics; and knowledge, training and development) alongside the development and acquisition of new technical capabilities."
Cyber forensics is challenging due to the lack of defined holistic features with a ground truth identity core, and scalable systematic methods to credibly link a person's physical and cyber attributes in a complex networked environment. Cybercrime continues to grow as humans conduct more online activities that generate sensitive data while connected to anyone around the world. In this work, we propose a new classification-based ontology and computational framework for resolving an identity based on cyber activities. Our ontology and framework extend legal case situational theory research to temporally map cyber and physical categorical traits. Initial experimentation based on real-world legal cases reveals contextual salient traits that are most effective in linking evidence to a person's profile or unique identity. As a result, these multi-dimensional traits support innovative visualizations that depict a person's linkable identity core, digital artifacts, security, and technology. The impact of our ontology and framework design is to support solving cybercrime by aiding in identity resolution.
Few studies have examined the victim-offender overlap in cybercrimes, especially using mutually exclusive groups: victims-only, offenders-only, victim-offenders, and those who are neither. The current study uses a sample of adults (N = 837) to evaluate the predictors of cybercrime victimization and offending generally, as well as the group-specific differences and similarities. Cybercrime victimization significantly predicted offending and offending predicted victimization. Level of self-control, time spent participating in routine online activities, and demographic characteristics were significant predictors for both victimization and offending. Results showed that 40.5% of participants were victims-only, 20% offenders-only, and 16.6% were victim-offenders. Multinomial regression suggests there are significant differences and similarities between these groups.
This article examines the extent to which data privacy considerations are embedded and balanced in the substantive law, procedural law, and international cooperation chapters of the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. In light of the drafting of an additional protocol to the Convention that is supposed to address, inter alia, data privacy aspects of cybercrime investigations, the article provides a critical analysis of the provisions of the Convention that have been criticised for failing to provide adequate privacy protection. The basic argument advanced in the article is that concerns over the Convention's potential for lowering privacy protection are largely misplaced. However, the article highlights the need for further prescriptory guidance on data privacy for law enforcement. (C) 2018 Luca Tosoni. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Frugal innovation is the process of reducing the complexity and cost of a good or service and the process to deliver benefit to the customers or users. This practice is especially beneficial to developing countries as they actively seek sustainable national development options. The development and implementation of legislations is placed under scrutiny in this study where the research introduces a process model for developing and implementing cybercrime legislations in society, particularly small developing states, that includes domain/society understanding; cybercrime understanding; process preparation; legislative development; evaluation; implementation; and post-implementation review. An analysis of the current environment shows that the development of cybercrime legislation is fractured and often results in a lacuna in the laws of the land as countries struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving face of cybercrimes. This issue is further exacerbated by insufficient considerations of the supportive legal and justice system processes to facilitate effective legislative development and management of cybercrime. This phenomenon has major implications for developing states already overburden by multiple resource constraints. The study utilizes the principles of design science research where the descriptive and observational evaluation approaches are applied to demonstrate the utility and relevance of the proposed solution. The study underlined that frugal innovation in the developing contexts can be realized with the adoption of this process to promote successful cybercrime legislative process through the creation of opportunities for improvements in the efficiency of the full cycle process and the effectiveness of the enacted legislation."
Cybercrime is the newest security threat in the world today, and is distinct from any other threat facing the world. This paper attempts to place cybercrime in relation to other security threats, as well as illustrate the unique characteristics of cybercrime. First, an investigation of the major elements of cybercrime will be conducted. After the parameters of cybercrime have been laid out, cybercrime will be analyzed as a security threat on both domestic and international levels. Finally, current security structures will be examined for their effectiveness in controlling the threat posed by cybercrime.
Routine Activity Theory (RAT) and the general theory of crime have been widely employed to understand cybercrime victimization. However, there is a need to integrate these theoretical frameworks to better understand victimization from a cross-national perspective. A web-based survey was conducted among participants aged 15 to 25 years from the U.S., Finland, Spain, and South Korea. Factors related to RAT were associated with increased victimization in all four countries although results varied between the countries. Low self-control was associated with victimization in the U.S., Finland, and Spain but not in South Korea. Using decomposition analysis, we discovered that the association between low self-control and victimization occurred both directly and indirectly through measures of RAT. Our study demonstrates the need to integrate theories to better understand the dynamics of victimization. Despite the usefulness of RAT, other theories should be taken into consideration when investigating cybercrime victimization.
We conduct a secondary analysis of data collected to survey EU citizens' experiences and concerns with cybercrime. We devise a series of logistic regressions that measure how exposure to cybercrime can inhibit online banking, shopping and other activities. We consider three forms of exposure: directly falling victim, expressing concern about security, and reading news reports. We find that directly experiencing cybercrime decreases the likelihood of shopping and banking online by 4-5 percentage points. We find that expressing concern about cybercrime has nearly twice as much negative impact on online behavior than directly experiencing cybercrime. People who have not heard anything about cybercrime in news reports or from colleagues are more likely to bank online than those who have heard such reports. We conclude by reviewing limitations of existing survey approaches and make recommendations for improving questions in future cybercrime surveys.
Cybercrime is becoming ever more serious. Findings from the 2002 Computer Crime and Security Survey show an upward trend that demonstrates a need for a timely review of existing approaches to fighting this new phenomenon in the information age. In this paper, we provide an overview of cybercrime and present an international perspective on fighting cybercrime. We review current status of fighting cybercrime in different countries, which rely on legal, organizational, and technological approaches, and recommend four directions for governments, lawmakers, intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and researchers to combat cybercrime.
Data Mining is the process of identifying new patterns, insights in data and knowledge discovery, and is at the intersection of multiple research areas, including Machine Learning, Statistics, Pattern Recognition, Databases, and Visualization. With the maturity of databases and constant improvements in computational speed, data mining algorithms that were too expensive to execute are now within reach. Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software. Exploring and analyzing the vast volumes of data becomes increasingly difficult. Information visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with the flood of information. There is a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visualization and visual data mining techniques. Fractals and graph theory are very popular in different areas. We present a new method for estimating fractal dimension for network and new Taxonomy of visualization of data mining process application in Cybercrime activity.
In this paper, media reporting of cybercrime victims (with a specific focus on organisations) was examined. For this purpose, data were collected from media outlets in the UK and UAE. A basic premise of this paper is that media has the ability to restrict readers to either `opposing' or `favouring' views about the subject of the news. Research findings demonstrated that victim organisations were mostly shaped within a negative media frame in a given time period. Comparative analysis between UK and UAE news media showed the usage of similar language in portraying victim organisations.
Cybercrime possesses the characteristics of objectivity, instrumentality and extensity at different stages. These three characteristics interact and influence with one another, becoming the core of cybersecurity. Internal and external network development environment contribute to the development of stage characteristics of national or regional cybercrimes. Due to the complex geopolitical structure, economic dependency and dfferences in technological development, the Asia-Pacific region is facing a dangerous and complex network security dilemma, consisting of three intertwined stages of crime network. In this context, as one of the most active regional organizations and the largest network countries in the Asia-Pacific region, ASEAN and China should work together to carry out closer cooperation in international law enforcement and criminal justice on the basis of the existing framework, to build a more comprehensive and systematic system of prevention and control of cybercrime, jointly promoting the long-term stability of the Asia-Pacific region cyberspace.
The games segment is growing steadily and is a major part of the entertainment industry. In particular, the Free2Play games, or games that primarily rely on mechanics like in-game purchases which are playable on mobile devices, play an important role. In the context of virtual items, online role-playing games and multiplayer online battle arenas, still account for a significant share of total sales. The loop is completed with esports, that is competitive digital gaming for real cash prizes. As such, esports can certainly be seen as one of the major trends, and consequently a part of the gaming industry that should be in focus, with regard to potential criminal behaviour. This article discusses cybercrime in relation to digital games and its various forms. The focus of the paper is the players' perspective on the issue of cyber-crime around the world of digital games. For this purpose, a focus group with players has been conducted to discuss various aspects that have been identified through desk-research.
Cybercrime has become a major issue in digitalized societies. Addressing the rising amount of cybercrime necessitates high-quality research, beginning with examining its prevalence and trends. Examining the prevalence and trends of cybercrime requires a methodological approach that tackles the typical data quality issues of (cyber)crime data, such as validity. A primary problem is that different types of data (e.g., administrative process-generated data and survey data) do not show the actual number of crimes committed, leading to a large darkfield (dark figures). In order to tackle the methodological issue of the darkfield and concomitant validity problems, this article builds on prior research on administrative data and survey data as well as on a general background regarding underreporting issues in crime research. For instance, discussing the role of social desirability and trust in surveys. It then draws on the previous methodological research on crime data, generally, and on cybercrime data, specifically, to suggest an integrated mixed-data approach in which different data types (such as administrative data and survey data) are analyzed comparatively in order to gain more information on crime prevalence and trends. Embedded in the previous research field, it proposes this procedure in form of the Data Combination Approach (DCA). This approach is described and discussed, including potentials and methods of analyses as well as challenges, particularly regarding the differences between data types. In doing so, this article provides a solid foundation for future high-quality research on crime (particularly cybercrime) prevalence and trends.
Taking into account the wide diffusion that data analytics has had in different application areas and considering the scarcity of specific datasets associated with cybercrime within open data strategies in Colombia, this article aims to characterize cybercrime in the department of Cundinamarca, through the use of exploratory analysis and machine learning techniques. The present research was developed through 4 methodological phases: data adequacy, exploratory data analysis, application of machine learning models and finally generation of value-added information. For the development of the proposed study, a dataset was formed from the dataset of 35,000 records published by the National Police in the open data portal of Colombia, which addresses high-impact crimes within the department of Cundinamarca and occurred during the first half of 2021. The cybercrime dataset has a total of 1513 records and includes attributes such as: day, quarter, municipality, area, victim, age and crime, so that at the exploratory analysis level, descriptive statistics methods were applied on the different attributes, while at the machine learning level, the association rules and clustering models were applied in order to determine respectively the relationship of the attributes with the type of crime, and the representative groups formed by relating the age with the type of crime and the municipality with the type of crime. The study developed allowed to demonstrate the usefulness and potential of data analytics techniques in the field of cybersecurity, in order to support decision making by the relevant authorities.
"Data protection is perhaps the most important area in which legal requirements determine whether and how research into cybercrime and cyberterrorism may take place. Data protection laws apply whenever personal data are processed for the purposes of research. There are legal risks of non-compliance with data protection regimes emanating from strict legal frameworks and from rules on data security and data transfer. Researchers are strongly recommended to explore the possibilities of anonymisation as well as all obligations relating to notification and consent, which affect the legitimacy of data processing. The presentation of findings, with implications for research carried out in the area of cybercrime and cyberterrorism, begins with exploring definitions of data protection and privacy. We introduce the most relevant aspects of data protection for cybercrime and cyberterrorism research before an overview of the applicable legal and regulatory frameworks is presented. The way in which data protection interacts with other fundamental rights, namely freedom of speech, academic freedom and security, is considered in order to highlight important issues which may affect researchers. Another key feature of data protection law is the difference between countries in the way it is applied; member states have a degree of autonomy in this respect which is summarised and an overview provided. General conclusions are drawn from all findings and implications of the research undertaken for this chapter and key recommendations for those involved in research are presented."
How do tweets reflect the long-standing disparities between the northern and southern regions of Nigeria? This study presents a qualitative analysis of Twitter users' responses (n = 101,518) to the tweets of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) regarding the production and prosecution of cybercrime. The article uses postcolonial perspectives to shed light on the legacies of British colonial efforts in Nigeria, such as the amalgamation of the northern and southern protectorates in 1914. The results revealed significant discrepancies between Nigeria's northern and southern regions regarding cybercriminal arrest, conviction, and sentencing. Specifically, the results showed that the EFCC's criminalization of Southerners differs substantially from that of Northerners. The contemporary manifestation of inequalities concerning the production and prosecution of cybercrime on Twitter reflects long-standing contestations (e.g., economic, political, cultural, geological) between the northern and southern parts of Nigerian society. Therefore, since the North-South divide in present-day Nigeria originated from British colonization, colonialism is the base that shaped the superstructure comprising political, religious, historical, geological (e.g., crude oil), and economic factors. In turn, the article spotlights that regional differences in educational attainment, originating from differing experiences of Christianization and colonization, interact with regional disparities in the production of cybercrime. More research is required to better understand how these contextual disparities in society interact with the production and prosecution of cybercrime, given that Nigerian cybercriminals defraud victims all over the world.
This research aims to determine the relationship between cybercrime and inheritance laws within the context of legislation inheritance in Iraq. The undertaken study has followed a qualitative research methodology based on the primary and secondary data utilized as evidence to highlight the necessity of legislative inheritance law in Iraq and the lack of cybersecurity in the country. In addition, it has also highlighted the significant role of digital innovations in effectively dealing with the cyberattacks in Iraq by influencing the fact that government needs to invest in technological innovations. The data has been collected by utilizing the legal normative approach to address the aims of the present study. The data thus collected by the researcher was analyzed by using content analysis. The research findings have ensured that no inheritance law has been executed in Iraq, and it is crucial to devise legislative frameworks based on the inheritance laws for alleviating cybercrimes in Iraq and ensuring cybersecurity. Despite this, this research has utilized qualitative research methodology, which could be pursued quantitatively in the future. Furthermore, this study has considerable contributions and implications in theory and practice for future researchers.
In recent decades, criminological theories have identified a set of vulnerabilities in potential victims that seek to explain their victimization. When it comes to explaining cybercrime victimization, however, the important role that addiction to the vulnerabilities associated with technological devices can play has tended to be overlooked. In this paper we empirically link smartphone addiction, social support, and cyberfraud victimization in a nationally representative sample of 716 smartphone users followed for three years. The results of discrete survival and growth mixture models suggest that the probability of cyberfraud victimization is lower among users with a decrease in smartphone addiction and an increase in social support over the three years. These results allow us to suggest new avenues in the study of cybercrime victimization, with special emphasis on the psychosocial consequences that the deregulated use of these technological devices may entail.
It is a popular belief that humans are the weakest link in cyber-security. However, there has been little research devoted to why people do (or do not) protect themselves and what explains their behaviors. Instead, more attention has been paid to victimization and prevalence of cybercrime. Therefore, we investigate and compare the motivations to protect oneself against scams, malware and cybercrime in general using an adjusted model of the protection motivation theory (PMT), which includes subjective norm, threat and coping awareness. To test this model, different structural equation models (SEM) were used and compared, with each focusing on a specific cybercrime. Our non-random (convenience) sample (n = 1181) is representative for age, residence and gender for the Belgian population. The results show the extended PMT model is a good predictive model to explain people's protection against cybercrime. The findings suggest significant differences when protecting oneself against 'technical' cybercrimes (malware), compared to more 'social' cybercrimes (scams). The differences are situated on the predictive role of coping, threat awareness and perceived vulnerability. Furthermore, we found subjective norm to be an important predictor in the intention toward protecting against all cybercrimes. Recommendations for further research and awareness campaigns are provided in the discussion.
The opposing commander's mind is an important target and successfully striking it can provide a decisive advantage - Liddell Hart Due to the importance of cyber space, proper assessment and response to cyberattacks should be trained via exposure to simulated cyberattacks. Accurate simulation of cybercrime and cyberterrorism can prepare decision-makers for their challenges and develop expertise in addressing cybersecurity issues that will arise in real-world cybercrime and cyberterrorism events. Simulation also has a role to play in identifying offensive and defensive cybercrime and cyberterrorism challenges as well as cyber defense advantages. The simulation issues to be addressed are the aspects of cybercrime and cyberterrorism that must be simulated in order to provide useful insights. We describe an approach to developing a simulation environment to support analysis of cybercrime and cyberterrorism challenges and advantages. Cybercrime and cyberterrorism are different in several aspects, which leads to different forms of cyberattack as well as different objectives for each type of cyberattack. We discuss the potential effects of cyberterrorism and cybercrime, their common properties and differences, and the motivations for each type of these two types of cyberattacks. We present an approach to cyber warfare simulation that can illuminate the challenges and advantages possessed by the cyberterrorist and the cybercriminal. We present a methodology for assessing the cyber defense's challenges and advantages against both cybercriminal activity as well as cyberterrorist activity. The first section of the chapter contains discussion of the importance of preparing for cybercriminal and cyberterrorist attacks and broadly outlines our simulation approach for identifying offensive and defensive strengths and weaknesses. Section Two presents a discussion of background research and real-world events that are relevant to our work. Section Three contains a discussion of the differences and similarities between cybercrime and cyberterrorism. Section Four contains a description of the methodology and approach for using simulation to assess cybercriminal and cyberterror strengths and weaknesses. Section Five describes the use of simulation to assess cyber defense strengths and shortfalls against cybercriminal and cyberterrorist activity. Section Six contains a summary and further work.
The author outlines some of the amendments to the new codes referring to cybercrime, drawing attention onto the particulars of such actions and the legal effects generated by these amendments in the given context.
While extant studies have probed the causes, actors and effects of cybercrimes in Nigeria, knowledge is scarce on the adaptable nature of cybercrimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Fraud triangle theory and exploratory research design, I analyzed data emanating from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Nigerian Police, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Partial and total lockdown imposed by Federal and State governments in Nigeria to curtail the spread of COVID-19 delayed government palliative intervention, weakened social support systems and increased the vulnerability of Nigerians to COVID-419ners. The fraud scheming deployed included relief package fraud, food and data fraud, and COVID-19 cash support and loan fraud. These fraud schemes were designed to align with federal government's policy on COVID-19 palliative or intervention to defraud the unsuspecting public. Arising from the findings, the study recommends timely palliative support and unambiguous public enlightenment on beneficiaries to reduce victimization of vulnerable Nigerians. Anti-cybercrime agencies need to be proactive in preventing fraud occurrence, neutralizing fraudulent schemes and arresting cyber-offenders.
Purpose As a well-known social institution, crime prevention has traditionally been in the purview of public authorities. However, the ceaseless increase in the use of online resources and governments' responsibilisation approach to cybercrime prevention has created an ecosystem, which necessitates the empowerment of individuals. By introducing the concept of internal spheres of protection, the purpose of this paper is to show how traditionally public responsibilities require increased facilitation by individuals to adequately safeguard what they value. Design/methodology/approach This is a brief conceptual paper, which recasts the individual's role in cybercrime prevention through a critique of the routine activity theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979) and explains how responsibilisation (Garland, 1996) has created an unavoidable need to provide individuals with the knowledge and tools required to avoid online victimisation. Findings In the context of cybercrime, criminological theories that are limited in considering the individual both as the target of crime and the person likeliest to prevent it are quickly becoming outdated. Public authorities either cannot intervene or are moving away from intervening on citizens' behalf to effectively stymie the pressure from cybercriminals. Thus, there is a need of an approach that starts with individuals and their value-based motivations. Originality/value The concept of internal spheres of protection is a novel way of looking at cybercrime prevention. The internal spheres are based on individuals' values, and the value of security in particular, and take cyber-knowledge as a point of departure towards safeguarding such values, i.e. through risk-decreasing actions and the use of relevant tools.
Background: Criminalizing crimes in cyberspace, in addition to highlighting the strengths of the case, also puts gaps and weaknesses before the legislature to establish criminal titles. The aim of this study was to investigate the criminalization of crimes in cyberspace and the role of criminals in crimes in this environment. According to the obtained results, fornication or sexual mediation and pornography with its sub-categories, i.e. preparation, publication and trade of ugly images, and insulting, defamation and spreading lies according to Articles 242, 742 and 743 BC are considered crimes. By examining sociological theories, the possibility of committing cybercrime due to the nature and nature of cyberspace has been easier compared to the difficulty of committing traditional crimes. So that the offender does not need special measures, but by providing crime tools such as computers or mobile phones and having an Internet environment, crime will be possible. The role of the individual in such crimes was also found to be very important, so that in this regard, people with the changes that occur over time, in their living environment and living conditions, and by freeing themselves from conventional forms of social control, can be driven to delinquency. Conclusion: Since committing a crime, in addition to violating the official laws of the country, is an attack on social values and norms, by adopting integrated preventive measures based on situational, developmental and social control strategies, and in parallel with the implementation of adequate education and information, it is possible to deal with cyber behavioral aberrations.
Cybercrime is continuously growing in numbers and becoming more sophisticated. Currently, there are various monetisation and money laundering methods, creating a huge, underground economy worldwide. A clear indicator of these activities is online marketplaces which allow cybercriminals to trade their stolen assets and services. While traditionally, these marketplaces are available through the dark web, several of them have emerged in the surface web. In this work, we perform a longitudinal analysis of a surface web marketplace. The information was collected through targeted web scrapping that allowed us to identify hundreds of merchants' profiles for the most widely used surface web marketplaces. In this regard, we discuss the products traded in these markets, their prices, their availability, and the exchange currency. This analysis is performed in an automated way through a machine learning-based pipeline, allowing us to quickly and accurately extract the needed information. The outcomes of our analysis evince that illegal practices are leveraged in surface marketplaces and that there are no effective mechanisms towards their takedown at the time of writing.
The push for technological enhancement and Internet connectivity in all aspects of modern life is radically transforming our use of devices and equipment that was not designed with this functionality. In fact, technological enhancements are transforming the automotive industry by increasing the number of components within the vehicle that are controlled by computers and which provide information to remote systems by various communications methods. These changes create new opportunities for cybercrime, particularly acts of cyber-trespass by computer hackers. This study considers how these technical threats may be limited through the use of criminological theory, specifically a routine activities perspective. The role of various actors in the automotive supply chain, and their potential function to deter and mitigate threats are discussed. The implications of this study for theory and practice are discussed in depth.
"Cybercrime investigation can be argued as still in its infancy. The technical investigation practices and procedures of global law enforcement are also still evolving in response to the growing threat of the cybercriminal. This has led to considerable debate surrounding the adequacy of current technical investigation models, examination tools and the subsequent capability of law enforcement to tackle cybercrime. To bridge the gap between low-level technology recovery and digital forensic examination, and to overcome the many technical challenges now faced by law enforcement; this paper presents an extended cybercrime investigation model capable of guiding the investigative practices of the broader law enforcement community. The Stages of Cybercrime Investigations discussed throughout this paper, demonstrate the logical steps and primary considerations vital to investigating cyber related crime and criminality. The model is intended to provide both technical and non-technical investigative resources, covering mainstream law enforcement, partner agencies and specialist technical services, with a formal and common structure when investigating the complex technical nature of cybercrime. Finally, the model is further aimed at providing cybercrime investigators with a means to consolidate understanding, share knowledge and communicate the resulting outcomes as an investigation moves through each relevant stage.

"The Cybercrime Prevention Act of the Philippines otherwise known as Republic Act 10175 has now been implemented. However, despite the government and private institutions' effort to increase awareness on the new law, many still fall victim to the different cybercrimes. Hence, awareness on R.A. 10175 should not be ignored to attain safety and security. This study focused on determining the users' perspectives on the legal consequences of some social networking malpractices and the reality of the Cybercrirne Prevention Act of the Philippines or R.A. 10175. Specifically, it identified the social networking sites used by individuals; it determined the perspectives of the users on the legal consequences of some social networking malpractices; it analyzed the legal consequences of some of the social networking malpractices in the context of R.A. 10175; and it determined the level of awareness of the social network users on the identified cybercrime offenses in R.A. 10175. The results of the study revealed that majority of the respondents do not exactly discern the legal consequences of the social networking malpractices. They believed that most of the malpractices identified do not have legal consequences which are contrary to R.A. 10175. This is certainly because they are barely aware of the cybercrirne offenses identified in R.A. 10175."
As the Internet evolves and continues to become a compelling part of our everyday lives, individuals, communities and nations alike are becoming increasingly exposed to the growing threat of the cybercriminal. The aim of this paper is to widen the discussion surrounding the many global issues and challenges of cybercrime investigation with specific reference to UK law enforcement. This paper first discusses the vast transnational landscape now associated with cybercrime and the rapid growth in cyber offences and other unacceptable Internet behaviours. The emerging characteristics of cybercrime are then presented as a Cybercrime Execution Stack. This logical model of cybercrime demonstrates an objective view and is aimed at identifying the common characteristics of cyber criminality that are likely to occur during the commission of an offence or other illicit behaviours. The concepts of a cybercrime investigation framework focussing on a UK law enforcement environment are introduced following the stages of Initiation, Modelling, Assessment, Impact and Risks, Planning, Tools, Action and Outcome. The benefits of such a framework are intended to provide a cybercrime investigator with a much richer understanding of the complex technical elements of networked technology and the Internet that must be considered when conducting a rigorous cybercrime investigation.

Spam emails are rapidly increasing on a daily base. An attacker could attract the email users to open spam and click on the embedded links that could takes him to malicious Web pages. We tried to inspect the awareness and the attitude of college students in three main Universities in Jordan. As total, 600 students from educational, science and IT colleges were surveyed. Although most of the students who participated in the study were offensive towards the spam email and cybercrimes, few participants do nothing against it. The students' major plays important role in increasing the awareness against the spam emails and cybercrimes. Moreover, we investigated three main factors as we thought it could attract the students to open and read the spam emails that could lead them to be a victim of cybercrimes. These factors are technological, social, economical and religious. The participation in this study was voluntary, only the students who have the willingness to participate in our study fill the survey. The result shows that some of the educational major participants are seldom use their email accounts, while others have some knowledge on spam emails and cybercrimes, yet they may get stimulated to follow certain emails. Those participants are more vulnerable to cybercrimes. Towards the end, we condensed a research direction and recommendations to rise up user's awareness and arm them well to the battle with spam emails and cybercrimes.
The current research aims to analyze the effects of cybercrime on business laws and its Implications for businesses and consumers. The purpose of conducting this study is to check the direct impact of cybercrimes on business laws and business laws on businesses and consumers. This research is conducted to focus on the several business laws prevailing in Indonesia and highlight the importance of business laws for any business. For data collection, the research has adopted secondary data collection. Reviewing previous literature from the past five years and relevant case studies is crucial for the given study. The collected data was then analyzed based on how other businesses implement the business laws and protect themselves and their consumers from cybercrimes. Lastly, this study has discussed several theoretical and practical implications and directions for future researchers.
This paper deals with the study of the problems of law enforcement system transformation in the context of a developed information society in order to increase the effectiveness of countering cybercrimes and improve the quality of their investigation.

The methodological basis of the study is a scenario approach based on advanced analysis and modeling of the development processes of the studied situations. The results of the scenario analysis of creating a single investigative agency feasibility, based on the developed multigraph model study are presented. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.
"Criminological research over the last couple of decades has improved our understanding of cybercrimes. However, this body of research is regarded as still theoretically thin and not fully developed; more knowledge on the actors involved, their characteristics, and modus operandi is needed. Some publications recently suggested that organised crime is or might be involved in cybercrimes, which would have important policing implications, but evidence-based research on this point is still scarce and inconclusive. This article seeks to further this path of inquiry by providing a systematic analysis of 40 cases from The Netherlands, Germany, UK, and USA where criminal networks were involved in financial cybercrimes affecting the banking sector. It also assesses whether and to what extent these criminal networks meet the definitions of organised crime and discusses the theoretical and policing implications of our findings."
Criminologists have recently explored online cybercrime-as-service markets where offenders offer hacking tools and services for a fee. So-called stresser or booter markets offering distributed reflective denial of service (DRDoS) attacks have been a recent target of international law enforcement action. Few have explored the ways in which these operations continued to function under increased enforcement and sanction. This study attempted to address this gap through a qualitative analysis of online advertisements from 44 booter and stresser operators. The findings revealed operators changed their preferred communications and payment platforms, as well as increased the attack methods available to customers. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of illicit online markets, and the decision-making processes of cybercriminals are discussed in detail.
Multiple works have leveraged the public Bitcoin ledger to estimate the revenue cybercriminals obtain from their victims. Estimations focusing on the same target often do not agree, due to the use of different methodologies, seed addresses, and time periods. These factors make it challenging to understand the impact of their methodological differences. Furthermore, they underestimate the revenue due to the (lack of) coverage on the target's payment addresses, but how large this impact remains unknown. In this work, we perform the first systematic analysis on the estimation of cybercrime bitcoin revenue. We implement a tool that can replicate the different estimation methodologies. Using our tool we can quantify, in a controlled setting, the impact of the different methodology steps. In contrast to what is widely believed, we show that the revenue is not always underestimated. There exist methodologies that can introduce huge overestimation. We collect 30,424 payment addresses and use them to compare the financial impact of 6 cybercrimes (ransomware, clippers, sextortion, Ponzi schemes, giveaway scams, exchange scams) and of 141 cybercriminal groups. We observe that the popular multi-input clustering fails to discover addresses for 40% of groups. We quantify, for the first time, the impact of the (lack of) coverage on the estimation. For this, we propose two techniques to achieve high coverage, possibly nearly complete, on the DeadBolt server ransomware. Our expanded coverage enables estimating DeadBolt's revenue at $2.47M, 39 times higher than the estimation using two popular Internet scan engines.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, among other things, has shown how the contemporary global community is inescapably wired to a virtual existentiality for continued human relations and correspondence. This human-digital relationship however spiked an unprecedented wave of global cybercrime during the pandemic's 2020 upsurge. Reflecting on its (trans)national/situational peculiarities, I argue that Nigerian COVID-19 cybercrime uniquely revealed a heightened feature of deviant urban-youth subculture interrogating the dominant systemic neglect of the youth in Nigeria and its link to European colonialism/contemporary Western neoliberalism. The paper proposes that redressing Nigerian cybercrime would require (among other things) concerted global efforts to reintegrate the urban-youth.
The rise of large-scale vulnerability scanners, which make the detection of vulnerabilities easy, has recently raised the attention to the security community. This leads to multiple research on the effectiveness of large-scale vulnerability notifications as a countermeasure and several studies have examined the different factors that could impact the effectiveness and how they could incite people to apply vulnerability fixing steps. And we contend that using a legal constraint could improve the vulnerability fixing rate. In this paper, we survey the Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Legislations of 156 countries looking for Articles that consider the liability of vulnerable resource owners. We discovered that only two countries required companies, regardless of the industry, to implement cybersecurity measures and conduct vulnerability assessments. This study aims to define a more effective large-scale vulnerability notifications system using Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Laws.
In this article we continue previous work in which a framework for preventing or limiting a privacy breach of a third party during the investigation of cybercrime. The investigations may be conducted internally (by the enterprise), or externally (by a third party, or a law enforcement agency) depending on the jurisdiction and context of the case. In many cases, an enterprise will conduct an internal investigation against some allegation of wrongdoing by an employee, or a client. In these cases maintaining the privacy promise made to other clients or customers is an ideal that the enterprise may wish to honour, especially if the image or brand of the enterprise may be impacted when the details of the process followed during the investigation becomes clear. The article reports on the results of the implementation of the privacy breach detection - it also includes lessons learned, and proposes further steps for refining the breach detection techniques and methods for future digital forensic investigation.
"A survey of literature shows that extant studies in Nigeria have not examined how lyrical constructions can enhance our understanding of the cultural context of cyber-criminality. Using Olu Maintains Yahooze, Kelly Handsomes Maga Don Pay and Abolore Adiguns Living Thing all of which glamorizes cybercrimes, the study analyses their representations and justification of cybercrimes in Nigeria. All songs provide justification for cybercriminality by constructing it as a as a way out of suffering; a game and work with huge material benefits rather than a crime. Taken together, cybercrime glamorization by popular musicians is dysfunctional to the eradication of cyber-criminality. It is suggested that anti-cybercrime agencies must partner the Nigerian music industry to deglamorise cybercrimes."
Objectives Examine the level of engagement of young users with money mule recruitment ads on Instagram. Methods Three ads reflecting key cybercrime involvement mechanisms and targeting Dutch user clusters were run on two Instagram placements. By means of this quasi-experimental 3 x 2 factorial design, we were able to analyze the reach and views of the ads, click-through rates, gender of the participants, and temporal distributions of user engagement. Results Mimicking actual recruitment environments, analysis shows that up to 3% of young users engaged with the ads, especially those promoting a luxury lifestyle and using neutralization techniques. Men were more likely to engage, and click-through rates were higher at night. Conclusions Some young Instagram users seem prone to making money through their bank cards and risk becoming involved in cybercrime online. We encourage future research to explore further the use of social media in criminological studies.
Ensuring the cyber security management is an ever-increasing challenge for the financial institutions and the national financial regulators. The main purpose of the research is to improve cyber security management through analyzing large data volumes of information which helps to identify potential cyber threats at an early stage. The factors of the rapid cybercrime growth via supervised learning models with associated learning (SVM) were identified and evaluated in the paper. The object of research is 21 EU countries. The paper presents the results of an empirical analysis, which showed that the cyber threats are caused by the growth of using online banking (0.49), improvement of internet user skills (0.42), expansion of activities online (0.41). The results of the research can be useful for financial institutions, national regulators and cybersecurity professionals.
Multiple studies and surveys focus on specific cybercrime characteristics or develop classification models that do not adequately address the complexity of this contemporary type of crime. This study proposes a comprehensive approach towards cybercrime interpretation and action recommendation through a proposed framework that provides three separate and complementary views to achieve a comprehensive perspective that leads to actionable recommendations. The framework's view I identifies the features of a cybercrime incident and their corresponding elements generating a textual schema-based description that can accommodate existing and new instances of cybercrime. The second view introduces an up-to-date cybercrime-related offence classification system through consolidation and elaboration of existing approaches and leads to a visual extension of schema-based incident description that depicts the interrelations of the various cybercrime elements towards a particular type of offence. View III identifies and interconnects the relevant stakeholders with preventive and response actions and measures. The proposed framework extends previous published work on the theoretical foundation of this multi-faceted domain, and demonstrates that the necessity of a comprehensive approach towards cybercrime can be actualized through different steps with each one designated towards a different perspective.
This paper develops a theory-based taxonomy for cybercrime. The need for a cybercrime taxonomy stems from the lack of a definition and standards to measure and manage cybercrime. We define cybercrime as an act that uses computer technology to commit a crime. The four building blocks of our taxonomy include mutual exclusivity, structure, exhaustiveness, and well-defined categories, which together provide the theoretical foundation. As a proof-of concept, we use exemplars and heuristics to validate our taxonomy. We identify our contributions for both theory and practice. We discuss implications of our taxonomy from the perspectives of management, reporting, disclosure, governance, regulation and the judiciary. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
A pilot effort to raise students' awareness on the human factors of cybersecurity and cybercrime is presented. One day, instead of lectures, a commercial film was projected. The students were able to identify most of the cyberattacks related to the technical background given in the course, while they missed some of the frauds committed by the actors, related to the psycho-social and legal dimensions, which were not covered in the syllabus. The students had the opportunity to acquire some insight about the latter while enjoying the movie. The whole experiment was evaluated positively. Thus, it became clear to the students that cybersecurity has also a psycho-social dimension which should not be underestimated
"Cybercrime is the use of IT in any suspicious criminal activities. Currently, our life becomes increasingly depending on modern information technology; however, it has become very necessary to improve the cybercrime investigation techniques especially in when processing very secret and sensitive information such as government and military intelligence, financial or personal private information. Cybercrime investigation attempts to detect unauthorized access to information in digital source with the intent to steal, modify or destroy that digital information. Such suspicious activities can cause financial damages or government information disseminates; moreover, it might destroy military high secret and confidential information. Therefore, this chapter focuses mainly on highlighting the main challenges of Middle East's and North Africa's countries in cybercrime investigation system by considering the recent developments in the continents Internet infrastructure and the need of information security laws in these particular countries. This chapter mainly focuses on Internet infrastructure development in these particular to show how they might become vulnerable to cybercrime attacks."
Cybercrime has received significant coverage in recent years, with the media, law enforcers, and governments all working to bring the issue to our attention. This paper begins by presenting an overview of the problem, considering the scope and scale of reported incidents. From this, a series of common attack types are considered (focusing upon website defacement, denial of service and malware), with specific emphasis upon the potential for these to be automated and mounted by novices. Leading on from this, the problem of policing cybercrime is considered, with attention to the need for suitable legislation, and appropriate resourcing of law enforcers. It is concluded that that cybercrime is an inevitable downside of the information society, and that organizations and individuals consequently have a stake in ensuring their own protection.
Cybercrime is big business with devastating consequences, from loss of intellectual property, customer details and finances to loss of brand values and hard-won customer loyalty.
The subject of content-based cybercrime has put on substantial coverage in recent past. It is the need of the time for web-based social media providers to have the capability to distinguish oppressive substance both precisely and proficiently to secure their clients. Support vector machine (SVM) is usually acknowledged as an efficient supervised learning model for various classification problems. Nevertheless, the success of an SVM model relies upon the ideal selection of its parameters as well as the structure of the data. Thus, this research work aims to concurrently optimize the parameters and feature selection with a target to build the quality of SVM. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model that is the integration of cuckoo search and SVM, for feature selection and parameter optimization for efficiently solving the problem of content-based cybercrime detection. The proposed model is tested on four different datasets obtained from Twitter, ASKfm and FormSpring to identify bully terms using Scikit-Learn library and LIBSVM of Python. The results of the proposed model demonstrate significant improvement in the performance of classification on all the datasets in comparison to recent existing models. The success rate of the SVM classifier with the excellent recall is 0.971 via tenfold cross-validation, which demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model.
Based on the actual data, cases of cyber ceimes and the author's experience of attending crime investigation, this article analyzes the characteristics and tendency of new cybercrimes, talks about the requirements of cybercrime prevention and control, and shows us the problems of cybercrime investigation for obtaining evidence. The investigation department should improve the ability to investigate and collect evidence from the material evidence to the electronic evidence. There're some problems that must be paid attention in the process of electronic evidence collection. The readers will get to know the techniques and methods of cybercrime scene protection, site investigation and online tracking in the investigation of cybercrime cases. The basic principles of extracting electronic evidence are expounded. The cybercrime investigation process is refined. The model of cybercrime investigation and evidence collection is constructed.
Cybercrime encompasses all illegal actions and facts that target cyberspaces and cause enormous economic and financial damages to organizations and individuals. A cyberspace is essentially composed of digital information as well as its store and communication instruments/platforms. To remedy this phenomenon, attention has focused particularly on both computer security and legislation in an area where the human behavior is also decisive. Social psychology has well defined the concept of behavior and also studied its relations with the attitude in human action. This paper aims to broaden the scope of cybercrime to also discuss marginal phenomena which do not attract enough attention but could easily be converted to digital criminals once circumstances become appropriate. The main objective of this work is the study of the 'human'-'digital world' interactivity in a specific geographical area or precisely the study of the human behavior towards digital crimes. The proposed study targets young people of a small Moroccan city that is in the south of the country central region and constitutes its global economy barycenter. The study dealt specifically with a sample of Moroccan young living in El Jadida city that coincidentally contains individuals from other Moroccan cities which enriched this study more.
With the wide spread of the Internet and the increasing popularity of social networks that provide prompt and ease of communication, several criminal and radical groups have adopted it as a medium of operation. Existing literature in the area of cybercrime intelligence focuses on several research questions and adopts multiple methods using techniques such as social network analysis to address them. In this paper, we study the broad state-of-the-art research in cybercrime intelligence in order to identify existing research gaps. Our core aim is designing and developing a multipurpose framework that is able to fill these gaps using a wide range of techniques. We present an outline of a framework designed to aid law enforcement in detecting, analysing and making sense out of cybercrime data.
This study examines the prevalence of different types of cybercrime victimisation and their shared risk factors among the population of Finland. We examine how respondents' socio-economic background variables, past offline victimisation experiences, online activity, user skills, and protective measures impact the risk of the most common forms of online victimisation and online polyvictimisation. Our nationally representative survey data were collected from 5455 Finns aged 15 to 74 years (response rate 39%) as part of the Finnish National Crime Survey in 2018. According to our findings, the five most common forms of victimisation were malware, harassment, sexual harassment, hacking, and fraud. Online routines and exposure to potential offenders, along with past offline victimisation experiences, served as notable risk factors for a range of different victimisation experiences online. Our findings show slightly different SES risk factors for victimisation of different online offences, thereby indicating the diverse nature of different types of online victimisation. Our findings also show that young age, better financial situation, high internet use, and user skills, along with past offline victimisation of property crime and violence, associate with increased risk of online polyvictimisation. High user protection decreased the risk of online polyvictimisation.
"This paper explores the legal challenges of combating cybercrime in Vietnam. We used a legal doctrine method to review the updated Vietnamese legal frameworks, consisting of substantive, procedural, and preventive cybercrime law. We then combined the analysis of four cybercrime cases and in-depth interviews of seven senior police officials to analyse the application of cybercrime law. The main findings reveal that by updating its legal system, Vietnam has shown a determination to prevent and disrupt cybercrime. Despite positive results, Vietnam's fight against cybercrime still faces legal challenges, including traditional and novel ones. Moreover, active and flexible approaches within Vietnam's cyberspace management can increase the effectiveness of combating cybercriminal activities; however, they can cause concerns in balancing cybercrime control and human rights protection. These approaches could then constitute a useful case study for other similar situations."
Cybercrime is wreaking havoc on the global economy, national security, social stability, and individual interests. The current efforts to mitigate cybercrime threats are primarily focused on technical measures. This study considers cybercrime as a social phenomenon and constructs a theoretical framework that integrates the social, economic, political, technological, and cybersecurity factors that influence cybercrime. The FireHOL IP blocklist, a novel cybersecurity data set, is used to map worldwide subnational cybercrimes. Generalised linear models (GLMs) are used to identify the primary factors influencing cybercrime, whereas structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to estimate the direct and indirect effects of various factors on cybercrime. The GLM results suggest that the inclusion of a broad set of socioeconomic factors can significantly improve the model's explanatory power, and cybercrime is closely associated with socioeconomic development, while their effects on cybercrime differ by income level. Additionally, results from SEM further reveals the causal relationships between cybercrime and numerous contextual factors, demonstrating that technological factors serve as a mediator between socioeconomic conditions and cybercrime.
This article highlights the challenges for the global community when harmonizing substantive cybercrime legislation. At the example of EU-Directive 2013/40/EU and the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime the benefits of a model law over a binding international treaty are pointed out. Protecting critical infrastructures is recognized as most crucial and their vulnerability of digital attacks with trans-boundary effects is identified. Eventually the EU-Directive is proposed as a potential model law for international harmonization regarding core cybercrimes.
Nowadays, use of machine learning is increasing rapidly in every field and plays a key role in sentiment classification. In this project, two-training datasets are used, one is an online training dataset which is available online and another contains pure cybercrime data extracted from Facebook and Twitter using Facepager software tool. The aim is to extract the cybercrime data and according to supervised machine learning, separate the data in two labelled class (i.e. positive and negative) and pre-processing it to get a clean training dataset. The goal is to use cybercrime data to achieve classifier accuracy percent and text classification with confidence value that will be achieved by using NLTK and Scikit-learn. The results achieved using both datasets show that using cybercrime datasets gives better classifier accuracy percent.
The legal domain has challenging aspects. One is that legislation is written to regulate an unpredictable number of cases and, therefore, the language of the law is made of open texture and ambiguous terms. Another peculiarity is that each country has its own legislation, often using the common legal expressions but with different meanings. This results in difficulty in understanding supranational cases and in the interoperability of knowledge bases as well. For example, cybercrimes, in particular, image-based sexual abuses (also known as revenge porn or non-consensual pornography) are on the rise globally. Several countries are responding to this social issue by adopting dedicated regulations. However, these regulations are still fragmented, do not share a common conceptualization. In this work, we face these challenges by proposing the application of an ontology-based conceptual modeling to represent a set of concepts and legal relations in cybercrime law. To evaluate the model built, we analyzed the subdomain of cybercrimes, in particular, cases of non-consensual pornography on digital platforms. The result is a conceptualization capable of being shared with other models, increasing the interoperability and clarity of the meaning of common terms and relations found in the various laws studied.
Cybercrime and cyberterrorism research faces a number of challenges, such as the rate of change in technology, field complexity and interdisciplinarity. This chapter aims at identifying the major technical challenges that require solutions to be developed for the successful prevention and fight against such contemporary problems. The following solutions have been elicited as a leading contribution towards the design of a cybersecurity research agenda. The identified and selected solutions include technologies and techniques for computer fraud prevention, investigation and detection methods and tools, and crime prevention methods that address human elements.
American laws addressing cybercrime are shaped by the general structure of law in a federal state with common law courts. As cybercrime encompasses both general preexisting crime that is extended onto the Internet, as well as crimes that are specific to a twenty-first century world of networked computers, legal responses include the application of laws of general applicability as well as specific enactments aimed at crime on the Internet. To date, American efforts at dealing with Internet crime continue to be dominated by reactive legislation and responsive recasting of existing criminal law actions to deal with crimes such as unauthorized access, fraud, obscenity, child pornography, and copyright infringement. Accession to the Convention on Cybercrime has seen the enactment of provisions aimed at meeting commitments thereunder. However, a systematic approach to cybercrime is still at a nascent stage.
"This article explores the impact of online crime victimisation. A literature review and 41 interviews - 19 with victims and 22 with experts - were carried out to gain insight into this. The interviews show that most impacts of online offences correspond to the impacts of traditional offline offences. There are also differences with offline crime victimisation. Several forms of impact seem to be specific to victims of online crime: the substantial scale and visibility of victimhood, victimisation that does not stop in time, the interwovenness of online and offline, and victim blaming. Victims suffer from double, triple or even quadruple hits; it is the accumulation of different types of impact, enforced by the limitlessness in time and space, which makes online crime victimisation so extremely invasive. Furthermore, the characteristics of online crime victimisation greatly complicate the fight against and prevention of online crime. Finally, the high prevalence of cybercrime victimisation combined with the severe impact of these crimes seems contradictory with public opinion - and associated moral judgments - on victims. Further research into the dominant public discourse on victimisation and how this affects the functioning of the police and victim support would be valuable."
"This paper explores the increasing number of cybercrime cases in Taiwan and examines the demographic characteristics of the criminals responsible for the criminal activity. The report is based upon data taken from the Criminal Investigation Bureau of Taiwan cybercrime database over the interval of 1999 through 2004. The paper defines cybercrime, addresses cybercrime case statistics and examines profiles of the suspects' characteristics. The findings show that the top five categories of crime committed over the past six years are sex trading or sex trading on the Internet, Internet fraud, larceny, cyber piracy and cyber pornography. As for the suspects' characteristics, the findings show that 81.1% were male; 45.5% had some senior high school education exposure; 63.1% acted independently; 23.7% were currently enrolled students; and 29.1% were in the 18-23 age bracket which was the majority group. Finally, this paper proposes four recommendations to governments, society, schools, and researchers to reduce cycbercrime."
Despite spectacular stories of successful cyber operations by law enforcement agencies, we continue to be extremely inefficient in fighting cybercrime. The research community has contributed many abstract models to guide digital forensic analyses, but these are usually too abstract to be helpful in concrete cybercrime investigations since they do not give an immediate and straightforward translation of a confronted (digital) crime scene into viable yet promising criminalistic actions. We propose a method to systematically bridge the gap between high-level process models and the demands of actual in-vestigations. The idea is to encode phenomenon-specific knowledge of cybercrime into node-link rep-resentations, thereby literally mapping the digital crime scene in well-founded visual representations e so-called cognitive maps. These can be used to derive a prioritized plan of action for targeted acquisition and analysis of case-relevant artifacts. To illustrate our approach, we present a cognitive map for the category of botnet crime and evaluate it with the help of domain experts and by applying it to two real -world cases.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Cybercrime remains a focal point in global and regional discussions concerning contemporary issues in West Africa. In line with this discourse, this article delves into the intricate web of viewpoints that envelop the issue of cybercrime in Ghana, with emphasis on Ghana social media users' opinion. Our study focuses on analyzing comments related to cybercrime that have been shared by Ghanaian Facebook users. Through thematic analysis, we dissect the primary narratives that revolve around cybercrime in these discussions. What we discovered in our study goes beyond the traditional portrayal of cybercrime as mere unlawful activity. Instead, we have shown a paradoxical sentiment held by Ghanaians who use Facebook. Cybercrime is evolving into a method for marginalized sections of society to push back against Western dominance, internal political hegemonic, and secure financial stabilities. This trend often unfolds within the broader context of challenging governmentalities. Our research challenges the typical focus on cybercrime as primarily a criminal matter. It prompts a reevaluation, urging us to explore cybercrime within the framework of various socioeconomic and political environments. As a result, our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of individuals attitude toward cybercrime in Ghana, reshaping the way we approach and discuss it.
Over the past few years, we have seen cybercrime rising to become a trillion-dollar business world-wide. Although the cost of cybercrime was close to $5.5 trillion in 2020 [1], it is now estimated to double by 2025 [2]. To put this number in perspective, a cost of $10.5 trillion a year is $28 billion per day, or $20 million a minute, or close to $330,000 a second. At such staggering rates, it is imperative to understand the drivers of cybercrime and how they can be mitigated.
This article provides a critical analysis of the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee's Guidance Note of Production Orders, published on 1 March 2017. The article looks at the legal controversies surrounding production orders with a cross-border element. It explains the Guidance Note's background and origins, the basic provisions in the Cybercrime Convention allowing the law enforcement authorities to order and obtain certain information and discusses the requirements that follow from the relevant provisions of the Convention. This analysis is complemented by four critical remarks on the way the Guidance Note pushes the boundaries of acceptable treaty interpretation on the necessity of the Guidance Note, its position in regard to extraterritorial enforcement jurisdiction and sovereignty, its reticence towards fundamental rights and its refusal to define or clarify the important notion of subscriber information. The article argues that unilateralism is not a solution. Instead of soft law plumbing, what is needed is an agreement between sovereign states checked by their constituencies.

Cybercrime issues across many economies are increasing at a faster rate. The rapid diffusion and penetration of the internet, as well as the processes of digitization of economic activities, have been the major catalysts. These cybercrime activities continue to pose a serious threat to e-commerce technologies and influence consumers' intention to conduct transactions using such a medium. Considering the upsurge of cyber-crime activities and the paucity of research in this domain, particularly in developing countries, this paper investigated how cyber-crime and trust affect users' intention to conduct business via e-commerce technologies. Using a survey approach, an online questionnaire was distributed and data from 476 participants was rigorously analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. The results indicate that trust in internet media, attitude towards behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and cyber-crime perceptions are significant predictors of intention to purchase using e-commerce technologies. The findings elucidate businesses and stakeholders on the impacts of trust and cybercrime perceptions on users' purchase intentions. It further brings to the fore the need to incorporate security features that reduce the vulnerability of e-commerce platforms.
An analysis of the links between human trafficking, smuggling of migrants and cybercrime, we suggest, exposes the overlap between legal principle and technological methodology This paper focuses on the role of emerging technological trends can have in the paradigm that may involve the protection of those who commit crime. We suggest that these issues should be considered at the development stage of technology and the proposal stage of an investigation, particularly where data is both harnessed and collected to tackle organised crime. The tension that trafficking and smuggling creates in the context of cybercrime is a challenge to rules-based order and rights-based policy because it requires a focus on protection rather than prosecution of those hitherto considered to be perpetrators. This in turn requires a greater interaction between the disciplines of law and technology.
With the widespread use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology as a means for commerce and identification, new types of cybercrime have emerged. Accordingly, revisions to extant cybercrime law are required. This research attempts to determine the relevance of current UAE laws in addressing new cybercrimes on emergent technologies. We reviewed the literature to identify threats to RFID systems, classifying works into three categories: blocking, interception, and physical attacks. We mapped these categories to 50 articles of the UAE cybercrime law to assess their relevance. According to the distribution of law articles pertaining to RFID attacks, it was found that RFID communication interception attacks are not sufficiently addressed in the law and that further amendments are required in the UAE. Example of international statutes are highlighted as models.
"While cybercrime is recognized as an increasing problem in society, it is unclear how users perceive cybercrime and online risks. This qualitative study explored how undergraduate students in England, a group who are at relatively high risk of victimization, viewed language and concepts associated with cybercrime. Three focus groups were conducted with a total of 16 18- to 21-year-old undergraduate students, and data were analyzed inductively and thematically. The themes explored in this article include: the physical world versus the virtual world; confusion regarding the law (including a perceived lack of police interest in responding to cybercrime); the normalization of risky or harmful online behaviour; and victimization. The themes also point towards a variety of misconceptions about cybercrime alongside an ambivalence towards the potential risk of becoming a victim. The data provide a potential step towards tailoring education packages and awareness programmes to ensure at-risk groups are equipped with actionable mechanisms to protect themselves. Further research is suggested in terms of exploring how such perceptions can be changed through effective training and awareness programmes, potentially reducing the level of risk in this group."
"Despite the rapid escalation of cyber threats, there has still been little research into the foundations of the subject or methodologies that could serve to guide information systems researchers and practitioners who deal with cybersecurity. In addition, little is known about crime-as-a-service (CaaS), a criminal business model that underpins the cybercrime underground. This research gap and the practical cybercrime problems we face have motivated us to investigate the cybercrime underground economy by taking a data analytics approach from a design science perspective. To achieve this goal, we: (1) propose a data analysis framework for analyzing the cybercrime underground; (2) propose CaaS and crimeware definitions; (3) propose an associated classification model, and (4) develop an example application to demonstrate how the proposed framework and classification model could be implemented in practice. We then use this application to investigate the cybercrime underground economy by analyzing a large data set obtained from the online hacking community. By taking a design science research approach, this paper contributes to the design artifacts, foundations, and methodologies in this area. Moreover, it provides useful practical insights to practitioners by suggesting guidelines as to how governments and organizations in all industries can prepare for attacks by the cybercrime underground."
Individual internet users are commonly considered the weakest links in the cybersecurity chain. One reason for this is that they tend to be overoptimistic regarding their own online safety. To gain a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in this assessment, the current study applies an extended version of the protection motivation theory. More specifically, this study includes perceived knowledge and internet trust to discover how these antecedents influence the threat and coping appraisal processes. Based on representative survey data collected from 967 respondents, we found that people who feel well-informed about online safety feel less vulnerable to cybercrime and are less inclined to take security measures. At the same time, feeling informed is associated with being more convinced of the severity of cybercrime. High levels of trust in the safety of the internet are linked to the feeling that one is less vulnerable to cybercrime and the perception that cybercrime is not a severe threat. Future interventions should remind internet users about their own perceived vulnerability and the risks that exist online while ensuring that internet users do not lose their trust in the internet and confidence in their own online knowledge.
Consumer intention and satisfaction are necessary for online businesses in this decade. The fear of crime and perceived risk has emerged as a challenge for consumers. The less focus on consumer intention has become a challenge for Indonesian e-businesses that challenge business stainability. The purpose of this study is to investigate the direct impact of cybercrime and moderating impact of CSR and business law on consumer intention in Indonesian e-businesses. This study is based on the quantitative data collected with a five-point Likert scale questionnaire and a sample size is 560 with a simple random sampling technique. A partial least square (PLS) measurement model and structural model are employed for data analysis of this study. The findings concluded that the direct impact of cybercrime (perceived risk & fear of crime) and moderating impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business law is significant on the purchase intention of consumers. The unique framework is a significant contribution of this research in literature. This research has extraordinary practical contributions critical for increasing the customer's intention to purchase. The study demonstrates that the Indonesian government should develop a strategic policy for the modern laws of e-businesses because many consumers are purchasing from e -businesses. The research has significant future directions that are critically important for scholars to explore the further dark areas in the literature.
This paper(1) examines the consumer protection regime under the Nigerian Cybercrimes Act with a view to assessing the extent to which it protects consumers from cybercrime in the banking and financial sector. It finds that the regime is not adequate as it does not place sufficient obligations on banks and financial institutions to safeguard the personal information of their customers from unauthorized access. Additionally, the findings suggest the absence of an explicit regime for determining liability for unauthorized payment transactions in situations where a consumer's electronic banking or payment information is compromised. The article also highlights examples of legal regimes in Europe and the United States that could be adopted in order to strengthen the consumer protection regime under the Act. Finally, some challenges impeding the protection of consumers from cybercrime in the Nigerian banking and financial sector are pointed out along with proposed responses to address them.
With the increasing prevalence of cybercrime victimization there is a growing need for prevention. Previous studies have attempted to uncover risk factors associated with cybercrime victimization in the areas of personal characteristics and online routine activities. This article aims to take the field a step further by including actual self-protective online behavior, obtained through a population-based survey experiment (N = 1886), as a risk factor for cybercrime victimization. In wave 1 of our longitudinal design, personal characteristics, online routine activities, and actual self-protective online behavior concerning password strength, clicking behavior, sharing personal information, and handling phishing emails were measured. In wave 2, cybercrime victimization of several types of cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent cybercrimes was measured one year later. Results indicate that few personal characteristics, online routine activities, and self-protective online behaviors are related to the odds of becoming a cybercrime victim. This furthermore illustrates the heterogeneity of cybercrime victimization, since most significant factors only seem to be related to the risk of one particular type of cybercrime. These results indicate that to explain cybercrime victimization, the research field needs to shift its focus and adapt to new online developments.
Cybercrime presents numerous issues for police organizations. A key challenge is to understand how best to impart relevant skills and knowledge about cybercrime throughout the organization to enable police officers to react appropriately to such incidents. This article is drawn from research undertaken as part of the CARI Project, a major study into the effectiveness of cybercrime investigation within a large UK police force funded by the Police Knowledge Fund. As part of the needs assessment for the above project, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of existing training arrangements in facilitating the development of cyber skills within police officers. The present research, based on survey data, explored the effectiveness of different training styles as perceived by those who had undertaken cyber training. The research found that officers perceived some modes of training as more effective than others and highlighted some of the organizational contexts that impact negatively on the delivery of effective cyber training. The findings are presented within a context, informed by existing literature, that acknowledges wider debates surrounding the pedagogy of police learning and the organizational challenges of developing cyber skills within police officers. The authors believe that the findings will have relevance to police training policy both in the UK and in the wider international context.
What are grand challenges of cybercrime and cyberterrorism policy and research for the coming one or two decades? To answer this question, we first need to grasp some major trends that influence the future of cybercrime and cyberterrorism, and the combatting thereof, in fundamental ways. This chapter therefore starts with sketching seven megatrends in technology and society: Internet as the infrastructure of everything, autonomic technologies, datafication, the onlife world, the transformation of crime, the fourth generation of cybercrime as attacks on the Internet of Things and People, and the gradual erosion of privacy. Against this background, seven grand challenges for keeping societies secure and inclusive against the threats of CC/CT are presented: underground marketplaces, hiding technologies, ubiquitous data, smart regulation, smart organisation, designing technology, and preserving the human rights framework in a volatile context.
The continued rapid growth of the Internet and the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) have resulted in the increased sophistication of malicious software or crime-ware tools and the refinement of deceptive methods to conduct computer attacks and intrusions. Cyber attacks via spam emails (unsolicited bulk messages) remain one of the major vectors for the dissemination of malware and many predicate forms of cybercrime. Monitoring spam as potential cybercrime can help prevention by observing changes in attack methods including the type of malicious code and the presence of criminal networks. In this paper, we describe the nature and trends in spam borne malware. This paper outlines some of the issues and problems in respect to the spam in cybercrime and gives examples of known cases and offers insight to tackle spam problems.
The way of live in the modern society has changed radically over the past few decades. In particular, thanks to the strong use of information technology, many activities have moved from the real world to the digital world. This has obviously introduced advantages in terms of data management and communication efficiency. Nevertheless, it has given also to the criminals the possibility to move into cybernetic space and, as a consequence, to exploit all the technological advantages available for carrying out their activities. In this context the paper provide an overview on the cybercrime and organized crime by focusing on the concept of crime as a service as well as the main issues related to big data by highlighting the social aspects.
Forensic linguistics is the application of linguistic knowledge and theory to forensic, legal, or criminal contexts. This article sets out some of the ways the forensic linguists can and do contribute to cybercrime investigations, as well as indicating how a basic knowledge of linguistics can be of use to investigators. This article introduces both investigative and evidentiary applications, including comparative authorship analysis, sociolinguistic profiling, and the determination of meaning. Through a discussion of casework and research this article aims to increase awareness and provide an introduction into the field of forensic linguistics, and its potential applications within the field of cybercrime. This article will focus on native language influence detection as an example of an area of forensic linguistic research and methodology that can be applied in cybercrime casework, discussing both the research and its findings, and demonstrating potential application.
This study analyses data from a survey of Australian adult computer users conducted in June 2021 to examine the influence of online routine activities and life stressors on the likelihood of profit-motivated cybercrime victimisation.Compared with non-victims, victims spent more time online, more frequently engaged in recreational online activities and were more likely to employ higher-risk online practices. Small-to-medium enterprise owners working from home were more likely to be victims. Respondents who had experienced recent increases in financial stress and gambling and negative impacts on interpersonal relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic were also more likely to be a victim of cybercrime.Being accessible online and a lack of personal and physical guardianship are associated with an increased risk of being a victim, but other factors may influence the susceptibility of computer users to cybercrime victimisation. This has important implications for cybercrime responses.
"Technological advances have enabled multiple countries to consider implementing Smart City Infra-structure to provide in-depth insights into different data points and enhance the lives of citizens. Un-fortunately, these new technological implementations also entice adversaries and cybercriminals to execute cyber-attacks and commit criminal acts on these modern infrastructures. Given the borderless nature of cyber attacks, varying levels of understanding of smart city infrastructure and ongoing investigation workloads, law enforcement agencies and investigators would be hard-pressed to respond to these kinds of cybercrime. Without an investigative capability by investigators, these smart in-frastructures could become new targets favored by cybercriminals. To address the challenges faced by investigators, we propose a common definition of smart city infrastructure. Based on the definition, we utilize the STRIDE threat modeling methodology and the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool to identify threats present in the infrastructure and create a threat model which can be further customized or extended by interested parties. Next, we map offences, possible evidence sources and types of threats identified to help investigators understand what crimes could have been committed and what evidence would be required in their investigation work. Finally, noting that Smart City Infrastructure investigations would be a global multi-faceted challenge, we discuss technical and legal opportunities in digital forensics on Smart City Infrastructure. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to quantify the number of cybercrime units that are on the world wide web and the manner in which they represent themselves, and to clarify how they are communicating information to their constituency (i.e. the visitors to their site) through new technology. Design/methodology/approach - There is no sampling frame that serves as an exhaustive list of law enforcement departments with web sites, nor law enforcement departments with computer crime units, nor law enforcement departments with cybercrime unit web sites. As such, the world wide web was combed using popular search engines to find as many US-based cybercrime unit web sites as possible. The final sample size was 88. Findings - The findings suggest that though cybercrime units across the USA typically have similar missions (e.g. to respond to one or more forms of computer crime), they used their self-representing web site in different ways. Beyond providing basic contact information and details about the cybercrime unit, web sites varied considerably in the depth and nature of their content. Units largely utilized these sites to simply exist on the world wide web. It was also unclear whether the sites actually fostered two-way communication between agencies and their constituents. Sites also placed an emphasis on providing information that visitors might use to reduce their vulnerability to victimization through educational efforts. Research limitations/implications - The sites in the sample all sought to inform their constituencies about the existence of the cybercrime unit they represent and the services they render, and to provide basic contact information. They seemingly differed, though, in the main intent and purpose of their site - which introduced variability in terms of the delivery of their content. Furthermore, disparities in available resources likely dictated the quality and depth of information presented on these sites. Practical implications - This work assesses the current state of law enforcement information delivery over the world wide web, and also informs best practices in quality, depth, and comprehensiveness of that information delivery. This can then be used by law enforcement departments who have a cybercrime unit web site to improve its current state and fine-tune communications and information dissemination efforts. Originality/value - This is the first assessment of the world wide web presences of US law enforcement cybercrime units and contributes to the knowledgebase associated with agency communication with external entities.
"In the latest years a spectacular growth of hacking cracking activity is going one. In many cases behind these activities young students are involved. What is the their motivation for taking the road of cyber criminality? Why they use their skills and knowledge to harm other people? What can we, teachers, do abut it? Not all cyber criminals start their activity with financial benefits in mind. In order to try to identify possible solutions to improve the present situation, we would try to briefly discuss the following subjects:, the motivation factors of youngsters to become a hacker, the public image of those who infringe the law on the Internet; The attitude towards other young people involved in such activities in correlation with involvement of a higher number of youth in cybercrime activities;, the level of knowledge and awareness regarding the notions of cybercrime;, reactions of youth in relation with the educational activities mentioned above;, the role and image of cybercrime law enforcement authorities;, involvement of other actors from the public or private sector in combating or preventing cybercrime. Considering the actual level of knowledge of the wide masses in the field of cyber criminality, we propose a higher involvement of education in preparing the people to face the threat of a cyber attack (C) 2013 The Authors.

Sniffers are among the commonest approaches for capturing network traffic activities and collecting digital evidences in cybercrime investigations. The ubiquity of instant messaging (IM) apps on smartphones has provided criminals with communication channels that are difficult to decode. Moreover, investigators and analysts of cybercrimes are encountering increasingly large datasets. To combat criminal activity, law enforcement agencies (LEAs) often rely on call-record analysis. In this paper, cybercriminals are investigated by network forensics and sniffing techniques. Retrieving valuable information from specific IM apps is difficult because the criminal's IP address records are not easily recognisable on the Internet. Here, a criminal's identity is located more effectively by a packet filter framework that isolates the WhatsApp communication features from huge collections of network packets. A rule extraction method for sniffing packets is proposed that retrieves the relevant attributes from high-dimensional analysis based on geolocation and a pivot table. The utility of this methodology is illustrated on real-time network forensics and a lawful interception system in Taiwan. The methodology also meets the ISO/TEC 27043: 2015 standards of fear, uncertainty, and doubt avoidance. Besides supporting LEAs in discovering criminal communication payloads, prosecuting cybercriminals and bringing them to justice, it improves the effectiveness of modern call-record analysis.
Cybercrime is rising rapidly in India. Developing economies such as India face unique cybercrime risks. This paper examines cybercrime and cybersecurity in India. The literature on which this paper draws is diverse, encompassing the work of economists, criminologists, institutionalists and international relations theorists. We develop a framework that delineates the relationships of formal and informal institutions, various causes of prosperity and poverty and international relations related aspects with cybercrime and cybersecurity and apply it to analyze the cybercrime and cybersecurity situations in India. The findings suggest that developmental, institutional and international relations issues are significant to cybercrime and cybersecurity in developing countries.
The advancements in computer systems and networks have created a new environment for criminal acts, widely known as cybercrime. Cybercrime incidents are occurrences of particular criminal offences that pose a serious threat to the global economy, safety, and well-being of society. This paper offers a comprehensive understanding of cybercrime incidents and their corresponding offences combining a series of approaches reported in relevant literature. initially, this paper reviews and identifies the features of cybercrime incidents, their respective elements and proposes a combinatorial incident description schema. The schema provides the opportunity to systematically combine various elements-or cybercrime characteristics. Additionally, a comprehensive list of cybercrime-related offences is put forward. The offences are ordered in a two-level classification system based on specific criteria to assist in better classification and correlation of their respective incidents. This enables a thorough understanding of the repeating and underlying criminal activities. The proposed system can serve as a common reference overtaking obstacles deriving from misconceptions for cybercrimes with cross-border activities. The proposed schema can he extended with a list of recommended actions, corresponding measures and effective policies that match with the offence type and subsequently with a particular incident. This matching will enable better monitoring, handling and moderate cybercrime incident occurrences. The ultimate objective is to incorporate the schema-based description of cybercrime elements to a complete incident management system with standard operating procedures and protocols.
Among various types of threats to urban and rural security, there has been an increase in cybercrime in recent years, an increase in criminal offenses in the e-environment. This also applies to the sexual exploitation of children in the e-environment. Sexual violence against children in cyberspace is linked to objectively determined factors, such as the development of Internet technologies and their wide availability. The active efforts of children to learn and use the new technologies, the attractiveness of the virtual environment in contrast to the real situation and the ambiguous and in many cases incomprehensible nature, as well as the saturation of pornographic material in the Internet, the weak control of their distribution, should be noted. Due to the increasing availability of the Internet, the expansion of e-services in cities and rural areas is relatively balanced. An Internet user may be at risk in both big cities and in a less populated rural area. Among Internet users the proportion of young people and children is relatively high, which objectively determines their increased victimization potential. Among threats to children related to the e-environment, multiple forms of child sexual abuse, including cyberbullying, sextings, sextorings, cyberstalkings, are increasing.
The objective of the research consisted of developing a strategy through which aspiring police officers of the Rafael Reyes Police School could acquire knowledge and adopt practices to prevent cybercrime, specifically, phishing, vishing, smishing, impersonation, and scamming. This strategy aimed to strengthen the police service by ensuring that students acquire basic competencies in this field and are familiar with the procedures to follow in the event of being a victim or assisting affected individuals. The research employed a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative elements. Initially, the researchers surveyed 220 students enrolled in the professional police service technician program to identify the most common cybercrimes that have affected the academic community. Additionally, by using the Virtual CAI (Cyber Incidents) service, the investigators identified the most reported crimes in the country during 2022. Moreover, statistical records of criminal activities registered in the Statistical Criminal and Contraventional Information System of the National Police of Colombia (SIEDCO) were also consulted, focusing on the five most frequently reported modalities. Finally, the authors sought to develop competencies in aspiring police officers to address cybercrimes by designing a mobile application that provides information on these felonies, protective measures, online tools, and instructions to file an official complaint. This case study highlighted the need for educational institutions, especially police training institutions, to prioritize cybersecurity and include topics of prevention and digital safety in their curriculum.
"Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly intelligent and aggressive, making them more adept at covering their tracks, and the global epidemic of cybercrime necessitates significant efforts to enhance cybersecurity in a realistic way. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the cybercrime threat landscape. Cybercrime has a significant impact on the gross domestic product (GDP) of every targeted country. It encompasses a broad spectrum of offenses committed online, including hacking; sensitive information theft; phishing; online fraud; modern malware distribution; cyberbullying; cyber espionage; and notably, cyberattacks orchestrated by botnets. This study provides a new collaborative deep learning approach based on unsupervised long short-term memory (LSTM) and supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the early identification and detection of botnet attacks. The proposed work is evaluated using the CTU-13 and IoT-23 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance, obtaining a very satisfactory success rate (over 98.7%) and a false positive rate of 0.04%. The study facilitates and improves the understanding of cyber threat intelligence, identifies emerging forms of botnet attacks, and enhances forensic investigation procedures."
"Considering the severity of the problem of cybercrime, it must next be deliberated whether forensic psychology can aid in the detection, prevention and governance of these crimes or not. While forensic psychology to date has generally focused on violent, sexual and juvenile offences, most of its theory and practice can also be applied to other offences, such as cybercrime. This chapter aims to investigate if forensic psychology can be useful in solving the problem of cybercrime, and briefly considers to what extent it has been applied to these crimes so far. Initially, definitions of forensic psychology will be discussed, and the primary responsibilities and activities of forensic psychologists will be described. Following this the authors will examine how each of these responsibilities and activities may be applied to cybercrime cases, before determining to what extent forensic psychology has been involved in cybercrime cases to date. Suggestions will be made for how to promote the benefits of forensic psychology in cybercrime cases, and finally proposals for future research and potential trends will be highlighted. In order to provide background to the reader who is not familiar with forensic psychology, a very brief overview of some of the key research in the field is provided in the appropriate sections below. However, the reader is encouraged to consult a textbook on the area in order to gain a more thorough appreciation of the breadth and depth of research in this field to date (see for example Davies, Hollin & Bull, 2008; Howitt, 2009 or Huss, 2009)."
Africa has been among the fastest growing regions in terms of cybercrime activities. The continent is also a source of significant cyberattacks targeting the rest of the world. However, a number of measures have been taken to address cyber-threats and improve cybersecurity in the continent. Many countries in the continent have developed legislation to fight cyber-threats. They have also strengthened enforcement measures. Private sector efforts have also been undertaken to strengthen cybersecurity.
A lot has been written on cybercrime and its prevention, but the problem has proved particularly resilient to remedial action. Desperate and vulnerable individuals in every continent continue to fall into its trap. Despite this, there is dearth of descriptive study that attempts to unravel the strategies employed by the perpetrators in Nigeria, as an important precondition for workable and reliable policy direction to address the problem. This article has filled this gap by using data from 40 cybercrime perpetrators selected with snowballing technique. The findings revealed that most of the cybercrime perpetrators in Nigeria are between the age of 22 and 29 years who were undergraduates and have distinctive lifestyles from other youths. Their strategies include collaboration with security agents and bank officials, local and international networking, and the use of voodoo that is, traditional supernatural power. It was clear that most perpetrators of cybercrime were involved in on-line dating and buying and selling with fake identity among others. The article discussed the need for reorientation of Nigerian youths in higher institutions, and various methods as guiding principles for potential victims. It recommended a complete reorganization of the Nigerian Police Force and Economic and Financial Crime Commission, as some of the officers in the institutions aid and abet cybercrime. It finally suggested a review of the Nigerian law guiding the operations of banking, poster agencies, and various speed post services in the country, as these are necessary preconditions to effectively combat the problem.
Malicious software is increasingly used by hackers and attackers in order to acquire sensitive information and compromise various systems. The sophistication of these tools has increased to such a point that individuals now sell various programs and services through electronic markets where data can be bought and sold. There is, however, minimal research examining the social dynamics that structure the relationships between buyers and sellers and the nature of the market dynamics overall. This study addresses this gap in the literature through a qualitative investigation of a sample of threads from 10 publicly accessible Russian web forums that facilitate the distribution of malware and attack tools. The findings indicate that price, customer service, and trust influence the relationships between actors in this market and influence the nature of exchanges in these forums.
Victimization from cybercrime has increased exponentially over the past decade. Frontline police officers are dealing with a variety of crimes different than those existing in an era before the advent of digital technology. Frontline officers are expected to encourage members of the public to report such crimes, to investigate them, as well as keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in this ever-changing landscape. This study explored the issues that frontline officers are dealing with on a daily basis when it comes to cybercrime. Sixteen frontline police officers took part in focus groups exploring key questions around aspects of cybercrime. The key themes discussed in this article include the difficulty of defining what is cybercrime, the contrast between the speed of developments in cybercrime and the speed of investigation, and the ineffectiveness of current training. The results are discussed in the context of a need for clearer training information to be delivered to all officers and staff who come into contact with aspects of cybercrime.
cybercrime research, particularly for criminologists. This issue provides critical examples of the diversity of cybercrime scholarship, both in (Akers, 1998), self-control (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1993), and routine control and opportunity received far less exploration. The same is true the work of Maimon et al. and Moneva et al. The work of Leukfeldt and Holt and Weulen Kranenbarg also expands our baseline knowledge of the nature of cybercrime offending and networked relationships. unique benefits of both traditional and novel research designs. For sample of individuals with experience with social engineering, either
Cybercrime threats are often originating from trusted, malicious, or negligent insiders, who have excessive access privileges to an organization's network, system, or data. The sophistication of insider threats has led to cybercrime issues. Even when an incident is detected, the follow-up countermeasures are required to analyze the results. The analysis of cybercrime insider investigation presents many opportunities for actionable intelligence on improving the quality and value of digital evidence. There are several advantages of applying Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) methods in cybercrime insider investigation. This study discusses the importance of actionable intelligence to conduct investigations and addresses the countermeasure of a cybercrime insider investigation with DPI to detect anomalies in network packets.
Cybercrimes are the biggest threat that can influence the future of e-commerce, particularly in difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in noticeable changes in e-customer behaviour represented in three types: spending rates, types of goods bought, and the number of purchasing times. More over, the percentage of cybercrime in many countries, including Saudi Arabia, has increased during the pandemic. The increase in the number of cybercrimes during the COVID-19 crisis and the changes in consumer behaviour shows that there is an urgent need to conduct research on the factors that have led to this. This study will explore the most significant factors that have an effect on the unexpected change of customer behaviour and cybercrime perceived risk during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The finding of the study will hopefully contribute to attempts in finding safer methods for shopping online during COVID-19 and similar crisis.
Cimes in the field of computer information have become pressing issue in society today. Its relevance is evidenced by news from around the world, criminal statistics, problematic issues in the science of criminal law, as well as problems in criminal proceedings. All this is due to the fact that as a phenomenon, crimes in the field of computer information belong to the very specific category that is constantly evolves technological progress. The purpose of the article is to study the phenomenon of crimes in the field of computer information, to define the concept of crimes in the field of computer information and types of these crimes, to provide general characteristics of crimes in the field of computer information, as well as to identify their classification. Various methods of scientific knowledge were used as a methodological basis for writing this article. In particular, comparison methods, analogies and generalization methods were used. In our time, cybercrime has spiraled out of the control of one state's law enforcement agencies and has become a significant interstate and transnational problem.
In the late 70's, a Group of Experts on Transborder Data Barriers and Privacy Protection was set up within the OECD. This expert group developed guidelines on basic rules governing the transborder flow and the protection of personal data and privacy. The purpose was to facilitate a harmonization of national legislations, without this precluding at a later date the establishment of an international Convention. The Guidelines are described as minimum standards for adoption in domestic legislation... and... capable of being supplemented by additional measures for the protection of privacy and individual liberties at the national as well as the international level. Decades on, there remains no internationally accepted set of principles, leaving states with piecemeal legislation.(2) The draft Cybercrime Law for Cambodia is just the latest in this long line of laws that attempt to resolve this issue. This Article will demonstrate, however, that the draft Cybercrime Law for Cambodia exposed a dangerous drift away from international human rights standards regarding protection of speech and right to privacy on the Internet. We will also propose possible redrafting of the Cambodian law, to bring it in line with their international human rights obligations and provide for easier implementation along with a possible framework for an international construct dealing with this pressing legal issue.

China is linked to cybercrimes of diverse types, scales, motivations and objectives. The Chinese cyberspace thus provides an interesting setting for the study of cybercrimes. In this paper, we first develop typology, classification and characterization of cybercrimes associated with China, which would help us understand modus operandi, structures, profiles and personal characteristics of cybercrime organizations and potential perpetrators, the signature aspects and goals of cybercrimes, the nature and backgrounds of the criminal groups involved, characteristics of potential targets for criminal activities, the nature and extent of the damage inflicted on the victims and the implications to and responses elicited from various actors. We then examine this issue from developmental and international political economy angles. Specifically, we delineate salient features of China's politics, culture, human capital and technological issues from the standpoint of cyber-security and analyze emerging international relations and international trade issues associated with this phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that China's global ambition, the shift in the base of regime legitimacy from MarxLeninism to economic growth, the strong state and weak civil society explain the distinctive pattern of the country's cyber-attack and cyber-security landscapes.
The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the seamless merging of the real and digital world, with new devices created that store and pass around data. Processing large quantities of IoT data will proportionately increase workloads of data centres, leaving providers with new security, capacity, and analytics challenges. Handling this data conveniently is a critical challenge, as the overall application performance is highly dependent on the properties of the data management service. This article explores the challenges posed by cybercrime investigations and digital forensics concerning the shifting landscape of crime - the IoT and the evident investigative complexity - moving to the Internet of Anything (IoA)/Internet of Everything (IoE) era. IoT forensics requires a multi-faceted approach where evidence may be collected from a variety of sources such as sensor devices, communication devices, fridges, cars and drones, to smart swarms and intelligent buildings.
Cybercrime-crime committed through the use of a computer-is a real and growing problem that costs governments, businesses, and individual computer users millions of dollars annually and that facilitates many of the same crimes committed in realspace, such as identity theft and the trafficking of child pornography, only on a larger scale. However, the current strategies deployed by law enforcement to combat cybercrime have proven ineffective. Borne out of traditional notions of criminal behavior, these strategies and tactics are often ill-suited to prevent or punish cybercrime, which often defies the traditional notions of criminal behavior bounded by the corporeal world such as scale and proximity. This Comment argues that a more effective methodology in the fight against cybercrime is to develop a model of community policing, in which the power to deter and prevent cybercrime is divested into the hands of individual computer users. One such strategy for achieving effective community policing against cybercrime is through the increased use of open-source soft-ware, software in which users are given access to the underlying source code and may make modifications to that source code in order to ameliorate vulnerabilities that may enable cybercrime. This Comment looks at the development of traditional community policing strategies and argues that the increased use of open source software-spurned by greater involvement by government and corporations-may be a more effective technique in the fight against cybercrime.
Although it is known that businesses report cybercrime to public authorities at a low rate, and this hinders prevention strategies, there is a lack of research on companies' decisions to report cyber victimisation. This paper analyses the UK Cyber Security Breaches Survey to explore factors associated with cybercrime reporting by businesses. Results indicate that the type of cybercrime is relevant to the reporting decision, and that the likelihood of reporting increases when cybersecurity incidents generate negative impacts and when the company places high priority on cybersecurity. However, we find no association between having cybersecurity insurance and reporting. Finally, while having outsourced cybersecurity management is associated with reporting to anyone outside the organisation but not to public authorities, in-house cybersecurity teams seem more inclined to report to public authorities. Findings are discussed in relation to the role of the private cybersecurity sector and the criminal justice system in combatting cybercrime.
This paper examines the scope and application of the clause of exclusion of penalty passed in article 16 of Act number 21.459 on cybercrime, which regulates authorized access to a computer system in the framework of security research, concluding that it is unnecessary in light of the definition of the criminal offense of illegal access in the Chilean legislation. In that sense, it is concluded that article 16 has, in fact, an expressive-integrating effect on the importance of computer system security research.
"The purpose of this report is to inform and warn academics about practices used by cybercriminals who seek to profit from unwary scholars and undermine the industry of science. This report describes the signs, symptoms, characteristics, and consequences of predatory publishing and related forms of consumer fraud. Methods to curb these cybercrimes include educating scholars and students about tactics used by predatory publishers; institutional changes in how faculty are evaluated using publications; soliciting cooperation from the industries that support academic publishing and indexing to curb incorporation of illegitimate journals; and taking an offensive position by reporting these consumer fraud crimes to the authorities. Over and above the problem of publishing good science in fraudulent journals, disseminating and citing poor-quality research threaten the credibility of science and of nursing."
Cybercrimes have become an eye-catching social problem in not only China but also other countries of the world. Cybercrimes can be divided into two categories and different kinds of cybercrimes shall be treated differently. In this article, some typical cybercrimes are introduced in detail in order to set forth the characteristics of those cybercrimes. However, to defeat cybercrimes, joint efforts from countries all over the world shall be made.
Cybercrimes are developing at a rapid pace, forcing investigative methods to follow suit through the implementation of integrated virtual reality (VR) techniques. The current study discusses preliminary findings from the utilization of VR training in cyber investigations, particularly in search and seizure procedures. Using a three-stage training, students were assessed on the use of a VR program through pre- and post-testing and in-depth interviews. These findings indicated that VR training helped students understand and reinforce concepts, procedures, and techniques of cyber investigation. These findings signified how pivotal it is to integrate VR training in academia and forensic departments. Cybercrime investigation training is expected to both quickly and efficiently incorporate technological and industrial advancements accompanying the Fourth Industrial Revolution so that newly discovered and sophisticated cybercrimes can be prevented as soon as possible. Ultimately, the training will aid investigators in creating efficient and effective countermeasures while alleviating burdens on the investigation.
This study uses open source, public information to examine nation-state and non-nation-state ideologically motivated cyberattacks performed against US targets from 1998 to 2018. We created the Extremist Cyber Crime Database (ECCD) that includes scheme, offender and target codebooks to address gaps in existing research and better inform policymakers. We describe our open source collection procedures, the type of information uncovered, and how we assessed their quality and reliability. We highlight our findings, compare these extremist cyber-crimes to extremist real world violence, and discuss their conceptual and policy implications.
This chapter presents and explores the legal issues surrounding the fundamental human rights of victims and in relation to non-discrimination, in the context of cybercrime (CC) and cyberterrorism (CT) research. In relation to non-discrimination, the focus is on social inclusion, minimising disparities and avoiding marginalisation of groups, particularly when presenting results of studies involving identified sections of society. The importance of victims' rights in relation to CC/CT research is then explored and the most relevant aspects as a possible limiting factor in this area are outlined. The infinite value of awareness of these considerations as well as independence and neutrality of research is emphasised.
Cybercrime's tentacles reach deeply into the Internet. A complete, underground criminal economy has developed that lets malicious actors steal money through the Web. The authors detail this enterprise, showing how information, expertise, and money flow through it. Understanding the underground economy's structure is critical for fighting it.
This paper is about the question when virtual cybercrime should be brought under the scope of the criminal law. By virtual cybercrime I mean crime that involves a specific aspect of computers or computer networks: virtuality. Examples of virtual cybercrime are: virtual child pornography, theft of virtual items and the killing of an avatar (a virtual person). Drawing from philosophical ontology and legal philosophy I will establish what the necessary and sufficient conditions are for virtual cybercrime to obtain in order to count as crime under criminal law. I will also examine when virtual cybercrime meets these criteria.
"Across both the public and private sector, cybersecurity decisions could be informed by estimates of the likelihood of different types of exploitation and the corresponding harms. Law enforcement should focus on investigating and disrupting those cybercrimes that are relatively more frequent, all else being equal. Similarly, firms should account for the likelihood of different forms of cyber incident when tailoring risk management policies. This paper reviews the quantitative evidence available for both cybercrime victimisation and cyber risk likelihood, providing a bridge between the academic fields of criminology and cybersecurity. We extract estimates from 48 studies conducted by a mix of academics, statistical institutes, and cybersecurity vendors using a range of data sources including victim surveys, case-control studies, and the insurance market. The victimisation estimates are categorised into: cyber attack; malware; ransomware; fraudulent email; online banking fraud; online sales fraud; unauthorised access; Denial of Service; and identity theft. For each category, we display all estimates in the years 2017-2021. Our review shows: (i) firms face higher victimisation rates than individuals, which increases in the number of employees; (ii) global surveys reveal a consistent relative ranking of countries in ransomware victimisation; (iii) although trends could be identified within studies that collect longitudinal data, these trends tended to contradict each other when compared across studies; and (iv) broad categories with unclear consequences (e.g. malware and fraudulent emails) displayed higher variance and average values than categories associated with specific outcomes (e.g. identity theft or online banking fraud). We discuss the outlook for cybercrime and cyber risk research."
"What follows here is an examination of the risks and issues related to illegal content within, and related to, the context of cybercrime and cyberterrorism research. Before any useful analysis can take place, it is necessary to create an understanding of the subject matter; therein lies the first challenge. The problem of establishing what the term 'illegal content' encompasses is addressed throughout. By outlining the particular relevance of illegal content with regard to research, we set out the key considerations which will assist in understanding what is required to successfully carry out valuable research and to understand the possible limitations. Some of these are related to the fact that the nature of much illegal content means that victim considerations are of utmost importance. Just as there is no specific definition of illegal content, there is no specific legislation addressing this type of criminal activity, therefore a wide range is presented and considered, which further assists in illustrating different perspectives. Countries too, have different perspectives and an in-depth examination of two of them reveal both similarities and differences. The general conclusion draws together the findings and the issues that have been addressed and provides a holistic view of the main points before key recommendations are presented."
While many countries have modernized their laws to take into account law enforcement needs to counter the threat of cybercrime, many others are in the process of doing so or have yet to begin. Drawing from the laws of a number of countries and from the provisions of the Convention on Cybercrime (2001), this Article discusses the policy choices lawmakers must make in developing appropriate substantive and procedural laws to combat cybercrime.
The boredom and alienation produced by capitalist societies and countervailing forces of attraction and excitement are at the heart of the subcultural account of crime. The underground hacker subculture is no exception, commonly represented as based around exciting, technically skilled practices and high-profile deviance. However, the illicit economy associated with these practices has become industrialized, developing shared infrastructures that facilitate the sale of illicit services rather than skilled technical work. We explore how this shift in the nature of work has shaped the culture and experiences of this subculture. Developing a novel concept-the 'illicit infrastructure'-and drawing on an extensive analysis of empirical data from interviews and novel data sources such as forums and chat channels, we argue that as they industrialize, deviant subcultures can begin to replicate the division of labour, cultural tensions and conditions of alienation present in mainstream capitalist economies.
Researchers have observed the increasing commoditization of cybercrime, that is, the offering of capabilities, services, and resources as commodities by specialized suppliers in the underground economy. Commoditization enables outsourcing, thus lowering entry barriers for aspiring criminals, and potentially driving further growth in cybercrime. While there is evidence in the literature of specific examples of cybercrime commoditization, the overall phenomenon is much less understood. Which parts of cybercrime value chains are successfully commoditized, and which are not? What kind of revenue do criminal business-to-business (B2B) services generate and how fast are they growing? We use longitudinal data from eight online anonymous marketplaces over six years, from the original Silk Road to AlphaBay, and track the evolution of commoditization on these markets. We develop a conceptual model of the value chain components for dominant criminal business models. We then identify the market supply for these components over time. We find evidence of commoditization in most components, but the outsourcing options are highly restricted and transaction volume is often modest. Cash-out services feature the most listings and generate the largest revenue. Consistent with behavior observed in the context of narcotic sales, we also find a significant amount of revenue in retail cybercrime, i.e., business-to-consumer (B2C) rather than business-to-business. We conservatively estimate the overall revenue for cybercrime commodities on online anonymous markets to be at least US $15M between 2011-2017. While there is growth, commoditization is a spottier phenomenon than previously assumed.
A great deal of criminological research has attempted to understand and identify the causes of victimization using the lifestyle-routine activities theory. Recent researchers have argued that the lifestyle-routine activities theory may be able to explain the increasingly significant phenomenon of computer and cybercrime. This claim has been contested by Yar (2005), however, who argues that routine activities theory is limited in explaining cybercrime. Few empirical tests exist to address this important issue. Thus, this study attempts to explore this gap in the research literature by examining a specific form of cybercrime, on-line harassment. Using a sample of students at a southeastern university, this analysis found some support for elements of lifestyle-routine activities theory. Individual and peer involvement in computer crime and deviance also significantly increased the risk of victimization. The implications of these findings for theorists and researchers are also explored.
Cybercrime has created substantial challenges for law enforcement, particularly at the local level. Most scholars and police administrators believe that patrol officers need to become more effective first responders to cybercrime calls. The evidence illustrates, however, that many patrol officers are neither adequately prepared nor strongly interested in taking an active role in addressing cybercrime at the local level. This study, therefore, examined the factors that predicted patrol officer interest in cybercrime training and investigations in two southeastern U.S. cities. The study specifically examined the relationship between demographics, cybercrime exposure, computer training, computer proficiency, Internet and cybercrime perceptions, and views on policing cybercrime with officer interest in cybercrime investigation training and conducting cybercrime investigations in the future. Officer views on policing cybercrime, particularly whether they valued cybercrime investigations and believed that cybercrime would dramatically change policing, along with their computer skills, were the strongest predictors of interest in cybercrime efforts. Officers who had received previous computer training were less interested in additional training and conducting investigations. These findings support the argument that more command and departmental meetings focusing on the value of investigating these types of crime need to be held in order to increase officer interest.
A systematised investigation process for copyright-related cybercrime offences has been designed in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and implemented by financial crime investigators of a Law Enforcement Agency. The proposed approach has increased the efficiency of the performed investigations and the dissemination of knowledge to relevant agencies.
Internet of Things (IoT) is the utmost assuring framework to facilitate human life with quality and comfort. IoT has contributed significantly to numerous application areas. The stormy expansion of smart devices and their credence for data transfer using wireless mechanics boost their susceptibility to cyberattacks. Consequently, the cybercrime rate is increasing day by day. Hence, the study of IoT security threats and possible corrective measures can benefit researchers in identifying appropriate solutions to deal with various challenges in cybercrime investigation. IoT forensics plays a vital role in cybercrime investigations. This review paper presents an overview of the IoT framework consisting of IoT architecture, protocols, and technologies. Various security issues at each layer and corrective measures are also discussed in detail. This paper also presents the role of IoT forensics in cybercrime investigation in various domains like smart homes, smart cities, automated vehicles, and healthcare. The role of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, and blockchain technology in cybercrime investigation is also discussed. Lastly, various open research challenges in IoT to assist cybercrime investigation are explained to provide a new direction for further research.
Cybercriminals exploit the opportunities provided by the information revolution and social media to communicate and conduct underground illicit activities, such as online fraudulence, cyber predation, cyberbullying, hacking, blackmailing, and drug smuggling. To combat the increasing number of criminal activities, structure and content analysis of criminal communities can provide insight and facilitate cybercrime forensics. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze chat logs for crime investigation using data mining and natural language processing techniques. The proposed framework extracts the social network from chat logs and summarizes conversation into topics. The crime investigator can use information visualizer to see the crime-related results. To test the validity of our proposed framework, we worked in a joint effort with the cybercrime unit of a Canadian law enforcement agency. The experimental outcomes on real-life data and feedback from the law enforcement officers suggest that the proposed chat log mining framework meets the need for law enforcement agencies and is very effective for crime investigation.
A European Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is an important instrument for boosting innovation and consolidating the European market and offering in a given sector. When it comes to cybersecurity, the establishment of a PPP is driven by the need to stimulate the competitiveness and innovation capacities of the digital security and privacy industry in Europe, and ensuring a sustained supply of innovative cybersecurity products and services in Europe. Given the growth and severity of cyber-attacks, such an initiative must take into account developments in cybercrime and cyberterrorism, including threats to particularly vulnerable and high impact areas such as critical industrial systems, the issue of trust and privacy, as well as the role of specific threat agents. It is therefore important that all relevant departments of the European institutions and agencies coordinate their efforts and bring in the perspective of Member States so that the full range of cybersecurity issues are considered from the public side, enabling the private sector to focus its efforts on developing a European cybersecurity industry through the adoption of an approach linked to the high and fast growth of technological competence and competitiveness. Only with strong governance and a dynamic approach can a PPP on cybersecurity develop a sustainable Digital Single Market ecosystem in Europe, making it a real and global cybersecurity leader.
With increasing popularity and 1.9 billion cumulative registered accounts, virtual worlds are seeing an increase in a cybercrime named Virtual Property Theft. Currently, there is no data available on victim's perception of reasons for this theft. In this study, the authors aim to identify these reasons, and fill the need for a deeper understanding of VPT. This study used a survey including questions on virtual property ownership, theft, recovery and security. This survey is the first to report the views of victims of theft and remarkably showed although users are aware of offenders and have adequate security knowledge, 23% still become victims. This highlights that cyber criminals have found loopholes in existing security systems. Finally, given the continual growth of virtual worlds, it is essential to develop new policies and effective regulations. In this paper we will discuss the most critical survey results relating to security and provide statistical analysis.
This study aims to examine the effectiveness of law enforcement on the protection of children victims of cybercrime in Indonesia. The method used is empirical legal research, which examines the law on social phenomena. The collecting data were from primary and secondary data. The primary data was based on the related institutions in handling child victims of cybercrime, and secondary data were collected through questionnaires administered to 4 (Four) selected Provinces samples. The results showed that the form of cybercrime experienced by the child as a victim dramatically increases every year and still seems to be weak in law enforcement. Public response to law enforcement from the aspects of law Substance, law enforcement, infrastructure facilities, inter-agency coordination is ineffective, and public responses to the handling of victims of cybercrime must be quickly addressed. This is a form of state responsibility for the protection of children victims of cybercrime. Thus, children can live and grow up to avoid the crimes that occur through the cyber development.
This article analyzes the European legal framework on cybercrime. Initially, it argues the challenges of cybercrime to traditional criminal justice systems. Subsequently, it focuses on the criminal law framework on cybercrime with a mainly European perspective. The European legal framework provides a three-path solution: the reduction of frictions among national legislations, the introduction of new investigative powers and the facilitation of international cooperation. The article presents and discusses each solution. Further, it argues that the effective implementation of the main legal instruments does not seem to depend on the legal enforceability of these international measures. Contrarily, other, non legal, factors such as national security, politics, the economy and the public opinion appear to stimulate the spontaneous implementation of the European legal framework. In this context, the added value of the EU action is rather low, although the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme may improve this situation in the long term.
In the world of cyber age, cybercrime is spreading its root extensively. Supervised classification methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models are employed for the classification of cybercrime data. Likewise, the unsupervised mode of classification involves the techniques of K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture model, and cluster quasi-random via fuzzy C-means clustering and fuzzy clustering. Neural networks are employed for determining synthetic identity theft. The formation of clusters takes place using these clustering techniques, which fetches crime data from the overall data. Cybercrime detection employs dataset that is fetched from CBS open data StatLine. The attributes utilized are concerning the crime victims through personal characteristics with total user identity being 1000. For analyzing the performance, different training and testing data undergo variation. Eventually using the best technique, the criminal is identified and the Gaussian mixture model in the unsupervised method reveals enhanced performance using the detection method. 76.56% percentage of accuracy is achieved in detecting the criminal. The accuracy achieved in case of classification via SVM classifier is 89% in the supervised method. Performance metrics for several attributes are being computed in terms of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), false negative (FN), false alarm rate (FAR), detection rate (DR), accuracy (ACC), recall, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and Fowlkes-Mallows scores. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed for assessing the performance of the Gaussian mixture model.
Now-a-days, cybercrime, cyberattacks, cyber security, phishing and malware are taking a more notorious role in people's daily lives, not only at the international level. The great technological leaps brought with them new modalities of cybercrime, the number of victims of cybercriminals has increased considerably. The objective of this study is to determine the state of the art about Mobile Applications and their impact on Computer Crime Prevention. Therefore, it has become necessary to know what preventive measures are being taken, such as techniques for detecting computer crimes, their modalities and their classification. To close this knowledge gap, a systematic literature review (SLR), a methodology proposed by Kitchenham & Charters, was proposed to obtain the detection techniques and classification of computer crimes based on the review of 68 papers published between the years 2017 and 2022. Likewise, different tables and graphs of the selected studies are provided, which offer additional information such as the most used keywords per paper, biometric networks, among others.
The rate of committing cybercrimes in Palestine has increased in recent years due to the increased use of the Internet and social media, in addition to the absence of deterrent legislation to combat these crimes. Palestine suffers from legal problems in the field of criminal legislation due to the duplication of penal laws applied in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This article will discuss the legal framework of cybercrimes in Palestine. The researcher will mainly use historical, analytical, and library research methods for this purpose. The results indicate that the legal framework regulating cybercrimes in Palestine is not unified, and the difference in legislation regulating cybercrimes in Palestine has led to different penalties for cybercrimes, which violates the principle of equality stipulated in the Palestinian Basic Law (Palestinian Interim Constitution). The benefit of this article is to propose some recommendations to develop Palestinian laws in order to combat cybercrimes.
Cybercrime forum datasets are large and complex. Prior research uses aggregated time series data to create a picture of the whole dataset, or focuses on a smaller sample of cross sectional data, often for a specific subcommunity or crime time. This paper uses the longitudinal time series aspect of cybercrime forums to measure and observe the evolution of forums at a macro scale. Applying the digital drift theoretical framework, borrowed from criminology, we find a large amount of churn on the forum, with only a small proportion of users continuing long-term engagement. Measurements show a continual shift in forum activity, with year-based cohorts moving from starting in hacking discussions, towards starting in general discussions, and later towards e-whoring boards. The group of members who are active on the forum for over 12 months, typically have their last post in the marketplace, while other members, who are active for shorter periods of time, have their last post in hacking-related boards. Overall, we see an increasing trend towards financially-driven cybercrime, at both the user and forum level. Users post more in financially-related boards over time, and forum activity has trended away from gaming/social activity, trending towards more activity in market-related boards.
Paper presents how safety and security of the railway system have changed over the years taking into account both internal and external factors. It takes into account internal changes in railway technology itself including more and more shifting to electronic, programmable and database systems and shifting from closed to open data communication systems. It also takes into account external changes pointing environmental circumstances, vandalism and terrorism challenges as well as cybercrime changes. Paper is focusing on cybercrime and cybersecurity. It identifies functions of the railway systems which are supported by IT based solutions. Paper subdivides identified IT based solutions by their influence on the safety and security as well as by their susceptibility to external influences including unauthorised attempts to influence the way they work. It shows how much susceptibility depends on internal and external data communication. Paper analyses different types of hazardous events influencing communication starting from relationships between possible undesirable events and threats, which are defined by RAMS railway standards. Conclusions are pointing sensitive IT solutions areas together with descriptions of the related challenges.
Year in and year out the increasing adaptivity of offenders has maintained ransomware's position as a major cybersecurity threat. The cybersecurity industry has responded with a similar degree of adaptiveness, but has focussed more upon technical (science) than 'non-technical' (social science) factors. This article explores empirically how organisations and investigators have reacted to the shift in the ransomware landscape from scareware and locker attacks to the almost exclusive use of crypto-ransomware. We outline how, for various reasons, victims and investigators struggle to respond effectively to this form of threat. By drawing upon in-depth interviews with victims and law enforcement officers involved in twenty-six crypto-ransomware attacks between 2014 and 2018 and using an inductive content analysis method, we develop a data-driven taxonomy of crypto-ransomware countermeasures. The findings of the research indicate that responses to crypto-ransomware are made more complex by the nuanced relationship between the technical (malware which encrypts) and the human (social engineering which still instigates most infections) aspects of an attack. As a consequence, there is no simple technological 'silver bullet' that will wipe out the crypto-ransomware threat. Rather, a multi-layered approach is needed which consists of socio-technical measures, zealous front-line managers and active support from senior management.

The official language of Kashmir, Kashmiri language or Koshur, is spoken by more than 7 million people, yet its content-based cybercrime detection remains unexplored in theoretical and experimental research. Furthermore, the absence of programming libraries for sentimental analysis and a benchmark corpus has impeded advancements in this field. Challenges persist in working with diverse scripts of Kashmiri, including Perso-Arabic, Sharada, Devanagari, and Roman. Detecting cybercrime in this language is challenging due to its complex morphological nature, lack of resources, scarcity of annotated datasets, and varied linguistic characteristics, emphasizing the importance of overcoming these obstacles to develop effective detection systems. This paper attempts to detect content-based cybercrime in Roman Kashmiri script, extensively utilized on online platforms like social media, chat rooms, emails, etc., by the Kashmiri community. A well-balanced and meaningful dataset, the first of its kind in this context, is compiled, incorporating positive and negative comments, and three strategies were employed for analysis. The findings reveal that the Tf-Idf Vectorizer outperforms other tokenization methods (Count Vectorizer and Tf-Idf Transformer), bi-gram notation exhibits superior performance compared to one and tri-gram notations, and the XGBM proves to be the most effective in terms of evaluation metrics. Leveraging these strategies, Python applications were developed for text classification, successfully distinguishing cyberbullying (unsafe) from non-cyberbullying (safe) instances, with the XGBM exhibiting exceptional accuracy using the Tf-Idf Vectorizer with bi-gram, a Bag of Words, and lexical features. This pioneering research underscores the urgent need for content-based cybercrime detection advancements in the Kashmiri language, paving the way for effective detection systems to address language-specific challenges and promote a safer online environment for the Kashmiri community. Furthermore, this research opens new avenues for further advancements in detecting and preventing cybercrime in Kashmiri and potentially in other languages lacking robust cybercrime detection methodologies.
Advancements in information technology are sources of both opportunity and vulnerability for citizens. Previous research indicates that there are significant challenges for police in investigating cybercrime, that community expectations about police responses are based largely on media representations, and that victims experience high levels of frustration and stigmatisation. This paper examines the views of the Australian community and law enforcement officers about the policing of cybercrime. Results suggest that police personnel are more likely to view cybercrime as serious, and community members are more likely to ascribe blame to victims. Results also indicate a discrepancy between police and community members in their views of the efficacy of police responses. These discrepancies contribute to public dissatisfaction. Therefore, the paper covers some general strategies for shortand long-term cybercrime prevention.
Cybercrime is a current and worsening problem all over the world. Various types of cybercrimes such as hacking, identity theft, harassment, and various forms of financial fraud are rampant. Further, although cybercrimes using information and communication technology (ICT) are widespread, effective measures and legislation to prevent or cope with them are in short supply. These circumstances warrant an analysis from a criminal's perspective of the reasons and methods for committing cybercrimes. Therefore, in this study cybercrimes are classified into three types-integrity-related, computer-related, and content-related-to identify major factors for each type and then propose measures to thwart them. We derived the main crime factors (i.e., cybercrime motives, enablers, methods, channels, suspects, and victims) for each type of cybercrime, then compared and analyzed them through interviews with police officers who specialize in combating them. This study contributes to the expansion of the literature on cybercrimes by deriving the main crime factors for each type of cybercrime from a criminal's perspective. Preventive measures for each type of cybercrime, based on the derived factors, can also contribute to the prevention of and response to actual cybercrimes.
"Cybercrime is one of the most significant security challenges of the 21st century. However, official statistics do not provide insights into its prevalence and nature. Representative cross-sectional field studies may help fill this gap, focusing on differences between urban and rural technology users. We (a) investigated the association between the purpose of computers and other electronic device usage and perceived vulnerability, (b) compared the differences in the purpose of computers or other electronic device use and perceived vulnerability, and (c) compared the perceived cyber victimization between residents of rural and urban areas. We conducted a field study that resulted in a representative sample of the Republic of Slovenia in Europe. We found several significant differences in the purpose of technology use and perceived cyber victimization. Furthermore, the results indicate that the purpose of technology use is somehow associated with perceived vulnerability in cyberspace; however, such associations are different in cyberspace than in the material world."
This chapter presents the UINFC2 Engaging Users in preventing and fighting Cybercrime software platform, showcasing how software tools designed to detect, collect, analyse, categorise and correlate information that is publically available online, can be used to enable and enhance the reporting, detection and removal capabilities of law enforcement and hotlines in response to cybercrimes and crimes associated with the sexual exploitation of children. It further discusses the social, economic and wider impact of cybercrime on a European and global scale, highlighting a number of challenges it poses to modern society before moving on to discuss the specific challenge posed by the proliferation of online child exploitation material and discussing the functionalities of the UINFC2 system as a response mechanism.
Underground forums enable technical innovation among criminals as well as allow for specialization, thereby making cybercrime economically efficient. The success of these forums is contingent on collective action twixt a variety of stakeholders. What distinguishes sustainable forums from those that fail? We begin to address these questions by examining underground forums under an economic framework that has been used to prescribe institutional choices in other domains, such as fisheries and forests. This framework examines the sustainability of cybercrime forums given a self governance model for a common-pool resource. We analyze five distinct forums: AntiChat (AC), BadHackerZ (BH), BlackhatWorld (BW), Carders (CC), and L33tCrew (LC). Our analyses indicate that successful/sustainable forums: 1) have easy/cheap community monitoring, 2) show moderate increase in new members, 3) do not witness reduced connectivity as the network size increases, 4) limit privileged access, and 5) enforce bans or fines on offending members. We define success as forums demonstrating small world effect.
The rationale of the article is contingent on the possible security threats afflicting the digital economy in the context of the cybercrime spreading. The authors emphasize the important role of the law enforcement agencies in the prevention and suppression of computer crimes, determine their priority tasks and propose the possible solutions to them. The research content touches upon the topical issues of the computer forensic analysis in the conditions of the digital economy development in the Russian Federation. The study focuses on the experts' tasks, problems of implementation and demand for various types of the computer forensics, taking into account the tendencies of the criminal attacks on information and telecommunication systems and the equipment. The article justifies the importance of conducting the comprehensive computer forensics in order to obtain the forensically relevant information when investigating crimes committed using the Internet. From the standpoint of the economy digitalization development analysis, the authors offer the options for the forensics practice improvement and organization of the training for the experts in the forensic units. From the standpoint of the economy digitalization development analysis, the authors suggest the solutions for the computer forensics practice improvement and organization of the training for the experts in the forensic units.
Criminals have been using the Internet to distribute a wide range of illegal materials globally in an anonymous manner, making criminal identity tracing difficult in the cybercrime investigation process. In this study we propose to adopt the authorship analysis framework to automatically trace identities of cyber criminals through messages they post on the Internet. Under this framework, three types of message features, including style markers, structural features, and content-specific features, are extracted and inductive learning algorithms are used to build feature-based models to identify authorship of illegal messages. To evaluate the effectiveness of this framework,we conducted an experimental study on data sets of English and Chinese email and online news-group messages. We experimented with all three types of message features and three inductive learning algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed approach can discover real identities of authors of both English and Chinese Internet messages with relatively high accuracies.
Online romance scams represent a growing global phenomenon. This study investigates a corpus of authentic messages of this type written in English, focusing on their structural, discursive, and linguistic features. The analysis shows that errors of judgment are exploited by scammers in order to lead victims to an inability to recognize an attempted fraud, despite the signs present in the message. The data obtained may contribute to the development and production of guidelines to be circulated widely, especially on sensitive sites online (e.g. dating sites), to help end-users to become more knowledgeable about adversarial fraudulent strategies.

Cybercrime scene reconstruction that aims to reconstruct a previous execution of the cyber attack delivery process is an important capability for cyber forensics (e.g., post mortem analysis of the cyber attack executions). Unfortunately, existing techniques such as log-based forensics or record-and-replay techniques are not suitable to handle complex and long-running modern applications for cybercrime scene reconstruction and post mortem forensic analysis. Specifically, log-based cyber forensics techniques often suffer from a lack of inspection capability and do not provide details of how the attack unfolded. Record-and-replay techniques impose significant runtime overhead, often require significant modifications on end-user systems, and demand to replay the entire recorded execution from the beginning. In this paper, we propose (CSR)-S-2, a novel technique that can reconstruct an attack delivery chain (i.e., cybercrime scene) for post-mortem forensic analysis. It provides a highly desired capability: interactable partial execution reconstruction. In particular, it reproduces a partial execution of interest from a large execution trace of a long-running program. The reconstructed execution is also interactable, allowing forensic analysts to leverage debugging and analysis tools that did not exist on the recorded machine. The key intuition behind (CSR)-S-2 is partitioning an execution trace by resources and reproducing resource accesses that are consistent with the original execution. It tolerates user interactions required for inspections that do not cause inconsistent resource accesses. Our evaluation results on 26 real-world programs show that (CSR)-S-2 has low runtime overhead (less than 5.47%) and acceptable space overhead. We also demonstrate with four realistic attack scenarios that (CSR)-S-2 successfully reconstructs partial executions of long-running applications such as web browsers, and it can remarkably reduce the user's efforts to understand the incident.
An increasing number of cybercrimes has presented new global challenges to law enforcement agencies that traditionally operate within designated geographical jurisdictions and patrol territories. The borderless nature of cyberspace has brought substantial opportunities-both legal and illegal-to its users, and many local law enforcement agencies have encountered motivated offenders taking advantage of the globally connected Internet and causing damage locally and transnationally. This study examines a high-profile case of European criminals who hacked into a Taiwanese financial institution-First Commercial Bank (FCB)-and programmed its ATMs to spit out cash netting the thieves $2.6 million US dollars in 2016 summer. Before the incident of FCB, this European criminal group committed more than a hundred similar ATMs hackings, victimizing dozens of financial institutions across several European countries, and profiting over one billion Euros. FCB is the only case revealing specific details about the modus operandi of ATM hacking thus far, in addition to disclosing reactions from law enforcement. By analyzing qualitative data collected from different branches of law enforcement involved in the investigations, this unique case study underscores the importance of national-local law enforcement collaboration in fighting transnational cybercrime. Empirical implications are particularly valuable in the law enforcement context of turf jealousies when defending homeland security.
In the two decades following the widespread use of the Internet, it has grown from a network that linked a few enthusiasts to become the essential element of modern life for millions of people [UNO 10]. In the late modern age, the world has become completely dependent on Internet access and sharing information over the Internet, while in recent years other forms of communication that join and connect people in global cyberspace' have been added. New connectivity options and changed ways of working have brought about new forms of threats, which impact the privacy and security of users when using cyberspace.
Anomaly detection is an important part of countering cybercrime, by detecting e.g., fraud or intrusions. Especially with an ever-growing amount of data (such as logs or transactions) being collected, automated analysis of these data for malicious behaviour becomes essential. In several settings, such analysis might be performed by third parties or be collaborative, to learn from more and diverse experiences by different collaborators. Thus, means to access such often confidential data in a privacy-preserving manner are required. Collaborative Learning and synthetic data are two promising approaches to fulfil this purpose.
"The Fourth Industrial Revolution has propelled global society into a new era of information and knowledge, transforming the economy and society of many countries. The global digitization process impacts more than half of the world population with internet access and the increase in the incidence of crimes in cyberspace, affecting the population mainly online fraud, crimes that attack vulnerable groups such as girls, boys and adolescents, as well as the diversity of cyberattacks with an impact on the availability, integrity and confidentiality of essential data and information systems of public, private and academic institutions. Most of these antisocial behaviors are published on the Deep Internet due to its anonymity, one of these being the TOR browser project (The Onion Router), in order to address this problem, a methodology was developed that allows the authorities in Mexico have a database that allows correlating data published on this network with the investigations they carry out derived from reports of cybercrimes to obtain lines of investigation based on the identification and classification of cybercrime, and using language engineering techniques and of knowledge as the methods of creation of ontologies of Ding, Y; Foo, S; recovery tool for large information files on websites such as wget, security measures for browsing the Deep Internet such as Whonix Gateway, Text Cleaning techniques, extraction and classification features such as Jaccard and Cosine Similarity Calculation, among other."
Introduction: Stats reveal an increasing rate of cybercrimes. Data breaches cost businesses an average of $4.35 million in 2022. This qualitative research explores the realm of cybercrime, focusing on adult perceptions and the underlying factors that might motivate engagement in online activities considered illegal or criminal. Objectives: The primary aim of the study is to explore how individuals conceptualize online crimes and rationalize their involvement in such activities, including illegal downloads and online bullying. Understanding these perceptions is crucial for addressing the broader implications of cybercrime in society. Methodology: The study gathered insights through panel discussions involving master's students from diverse international backgrounds at the University of Tehran. Thematic analysis was employed to dissect and understand the opinions and justifications offered by the participants regarding their views on cybercrime. Results: Findings from the discussions reveal a complex tapestry of attitudes towards cybercrime, encompassing various justifications and rationalizations for participation in illegal online activities. These perspectives provide a nuanced understanding of how cybercrimes are perceived by individuals. Conclusion: The research contributes significantly to our comprehension of individual attitudes towards cybercrimes. The insights gained are invaluable for the development of targeted educational programs, interventions, and legal frameworks aimed at effectively mitigating and addressing the challenges posed by cybercrime.
Although internet has emerged to bridge digital divides and improve how things are done across diverse spheres of life, its explosion has also brought unexpected threats, risks and loss of valuables over a decade. Consequently, there seems to have been plethora of cybercrime investigation models but the proliferation of these models has not substantially reduced the frequency of cyber attacks globally. Given that the recent development in cyberspace seems to follow same trends of how survivable Black Box (Flight Data Recorder) emerged, this chapter proposes a Black Box Forensic Cybercrime Investigation Model (BBFCIM). BBFCIM sets a new agenda for cybercrime investigation process by focusing on survivability and reliability of existing and would-be models rather than evolving as a distinct model of itself. It adopts soft innovative skills in the development of Black Box components to shape proactive cybercrime investigation process through sequential tests on each networking layers.
"Introduction Researchers and public authorities are increasingly exploring the potential of administrative data to generate new insights. This includes recent work leveraging the opportunities of the crime report data collected by the UK's national reporting centre Action Fraud (AF). However, the quality of these data and its implications for data users have not been systematically analysed. Objectives This paper outlines challenges and opportunities of using AF data in cybercrime and fraud victimisation research and practice and makes recommendations to improve the quality of this dataset. Methods The author has undertaken two studies using samples of AF data pertaining to crime reports within the Welsh police forces, between 2014 and 2020. Quality diagnostic checks, reflections and methodological decisions were considered across each study. These were reviewed, key themes were identified and discussed with data users and a broader group of researchers to finalise the recommendations presented. Results The strengths and limitations of AF data are discussed and grouped into themes, closely aligned with four quality dimensions widely used by statistical authorities. This includes an assessment of 1) the impact of under-reporting and 2) the purpose and rules of crime recording, on the relevance of the data to its users; 3) the accuracy and reliability of the data; 4) the consistency of recording and its impact on coherence and comparability; and 5) the accessibility and timeliness of the data. Conclusions Recommendations are made to improve AF data to generate better quality insights across the dimensions of relevance, accuracy & reliability, coherence & comparability and the accessibility & timeliness of this dataset. Additionally, a data catalogue would enable frontline officers and researchers to make the most of this dataset, harnessing it to produce key insights for crime prevention, investigation, and victim support."
This study assesses the Cybercrime Act 2015 and its implications for online press freedom in the liberal authoritarian state of Nigeria. Specifically, the study examines how the character of political leadership in Nigeria leads to wrongful application of the act to undermine the independence of the press. The study shows that Nigeria's online press freedom index has consistently worsened since the introduction of the Cybercrime Act in 2015, and it recommends the promotion of a holistic democratic project that recognises economic and political freedom as being inextricably linked.
Over the past several decades, criminological scholarship has increasingly focused on the problem of cybercrime including technology-enabled offending. Theoretical developments that account for these offences have not grown in tandem, leading to questions as to the nature of cybercriminality relative to traditional forms of offending. Recently, Goldsmith and Brewer proposed the conceptual framework of digital drift, extending elements of Matza's original theories to the virtual environment. While making a useful contribution to the theorization of cybercrime, we argue that further elements of Matza's original work also warrant consideration. In particular, we acknowledge the role of policing and the criminal justice system in affecting offender perceptions and decision-making. As such, this article extends the theorizing around digital drift to incorporate the ways that offender views are shaped in reaction to the law enforcement and industry responses to cybercrime. The implications of this extension are discussed in depth.
As computer and Internet technologies have continued to advance over the last few decades, a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to exploring online behavior. Criminologists, in particular, have been interested in examining cybercrime and online deviance. Contributing to this growing body of scholarship, the current research investigated the effects of gender on cybercrime and whether socialization can account for the gender gap in online offending. Data were collected from a sample of 522 college students and three cybercrime categories were examined: digital piracy, cyberharassment, and hacking offenses. The findings revealed that men were more likely to engage in online offending and that this gender gap was fairly persistent across the socialization variables of self-control and immersion into the cyberenvironment. Specifically, only three gender-invariant findings emerged: men and women commit statistically similar rates of digital piracy when self-control levels are low, and they also engage in similar rates of digital piracy and hacking offenses when Internet use is high. Detailed results, implications for theory and policy, study limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.
"The Internet is a decentralized structure that offers speedy communication, has a global reach and provides anonymity, a characteristic invaluable for committing illegal activities. In parallel with the spread of the Internet, cybercrime has rapidly evolved from a relatively low volume crime to a common high volume crime. A typical example of such a crime is the spreading of spam emails, where the content of the email tries to entice the recipient to click a URL linking to a malicious Web site or downloading a malicious attachment. Analysts attempting to provide intelligence on spam activities quickly find that the volume of spam circulating daily is overwhelming; therefore, any intelligence gathered is representative of only a small sample, not of the global picture. While past studies have looked at automating some of these analyses using topic-based models, i.e. separating email clusters into groups with similar topics, our preliminary research investigates the usefulness of applying authorship-based models for this purpose. In the first phase, we clustered a set of spam emails using an authorship-based clustering algorithm. In the second phase, we analysed those clusters using a set of linguistic, structural and syntactic features. These analyses reveal that emails within each cluster were likely written by the same author, but that it is unlikely we have managed to group together all spam produced by each group. This problem of high purity with low recall, has been faced in past authorship research. While it is also a limitation of our research, the clusters themselves are still useful for the purposes of automating analysis, because they reduce the work needing to be performed. Our second phase revealed useful information on the group that can be utilized in future research for further analysis of such groups, for example, identifying further linkages behind spam campaigns."
The annual cost of Cybercrime to the global economy is estimated to be around $400 billion, in support of which Exploit Kits have been providing enabling technology since 2006. This paper reviews the recent developments in Exploit Kit capability and how these are being applied in practice. In doing so it paves the way for better understanding of the exploit kits economy that may better help in combatting them and considers industry's preparedness to respond.
While we have a good understanding of how cybercrime is perpetrated and the profits of the attackers, the harm experienced by humans is less well understood, and reducing this harm should be the ultimate goal of any security intervention. This paper presents a strategy for quantifying the harm caused by the cybercrime of typosquatting via the novel technique of intent inference. Intent inference allows us to define a new metric for quantifying harm to users, develop a new methodology for identifying typosquatting domain names, and quantify the harm caused by various typosquatting perpetrators. We find that typosquatting costs the typical user 1.3 seconds per typosquatting event over the alternative of receiving a browser error page, and legitimate sites lose approximately 5% of their mistyped traffic over the alternative of an unregistered typo. Although on average perpetrators increase the time it takes a user to find their intended site, many typosquatters actually improve the latency between a typo and its correction, calling into question the necessity of harsh penalties or legal intervention against this flavor of cybercrime.
The present article aimed to explore if susceptibility to cybercrime can be linked to information security awareness and personality factors. A total of 1,054 participants aged between 18 and 84 years took part in an online survey consisting of a recently developed segmentation analysis tool designed to explore an individual's susceptibility to cybercrime. Alongside this, two other scales measuring information security awareness and the personality trait of impulsivity were also included. In total, 60% of the population surveyed presented as being in the higher risk categories for susceptibility to cybercrime. Furthermore, individuals in the higher risk categories for susceptibility to cybercrime also presented poorer information security awareness, as well as having higher levels of trait impulsivity. It was also noted that certain demographic factors also linked to susceptibility to cybercrime, including age and current employment status, with the unemployed and student populations being less well represented in lower risk categories. This work is seen as being critical while designing effective intervention strategies that are designed to target specific at-risk populations, as well as presenting a key tool that could be widely used by organizations to examine risk within their own specific populations.
The aim of the paper is to interdisciplinary approach of economics, criminology, globalization to characterize current problems of crime with cybernetic subtext in the global dimension. This is a constantly discussed subject, both in professional circles and the public, as the professionalisation and internationalization of cyber criminals is a daily security threat to all the macroeconomic and microeconomic subjects of the world economy. Cyberspace is not restricted by the natural boundaries of states or continents, so the pfenomen of cybercrime in the current type of society has become a global problem. The starting point of the economic aspects of cyber crime is the analysis of the rational cyber criminal behavior model. It is decided on the basis of the expected costs and benefits of its activity, expressed in units of cash equivalent. The decision-making problem of cybercriminals is an optimization task with regard to its costs. Another discussed issue is the methods of combating cyber crime and a detailed analysis of the method of increased intensity of combat. It is based on reducing the number of cybercrime committed using the mechanism of increasing the cost of criminals. Criminals are forced out of the market for a commercial variant of the crime, and the rest will at least reduce their production. On the contrary, for a specific version of the community variant of crime, this method leads to increased crime. The last topic is the interaction of network effect software makers, consumers and software pirates.
In response to cross-border cybercrime, investigative organs have adopted cross-border criminal forensic measures such as online public extraction, remote electronic data inspection and real-time monitoring, which may violate the principles of data sovereignty and judicial assistance. While promoting the establishment of a cross-border cooperation mechanism, China should establish a new cross-border electronic evidence criminal forensics model by promoting the procedural justification of cross-border search and monitoring measures. To better regulate cross-border criminal forensics activities, it is necessary to improve the cross-border cybercrime procuratorial organs system to intervene in advance and guide investigations.
With the increase in the number of computer crimes, law enforcement agencies in the field of digital forensics are expected to investigate more cases than before. Due to the complexity of digital forensic tasks, various investigation models have been developed to provide different points of view in abstract processes, specific activities, or practical tools. However, the integration of these points of view is rarely discussed. Hence, this study proposes a four-phase open-source fusion framework to address these issues. Furthermore, this work also evaluates the state-of-the-art open-source forensic tools and suggests the appropriate ones that are efficient in the investigation in each corresponding phase. The toolkits are considered in the context of digital evidence analytics, and help LEAs reconstruct the cybercrime scenario.
The study of topological indices for fuzzy graphs is beneficial for fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems and various connected fuzzy networks. In this paper, we discuss two fuzzy topological indices, namely fuzzy Randic index and fuzzy harmonic index. We establish several upper bounds for these fuzzy indices. We also present the lower bounds of these indices for different fuzzy products, i.e., Cartesian product, cross product and lexicographic product. These results and bounds are established in terms of parameters, like number of nodes, edges, minimum and maximum vertex and edge membership, etc. We also present an algorithm to determine Randic index of vertices of fuzzy graph. Finally, we implement our model of fuzzy Randic index in cybercrime problem for detection of more active criminal who is involved in many crimes with other criminals.
We outline in this article a study of 'adversarial scraping' for academic research, which involves the collection of data from websites that implement defences against traditional web scraping tools. Although this is primarily a research methods article, it also constitutes a valuable systematic accounting of the different defensive techniques used by the administrators of illicit online services. Some of these administrators intentionally implement functionality which attempts to prevent web scrapers from gathering data from their site, and some will unintentionally design their sites in ways that make data gathering harder. This is of particular importance for criminological research, where websites such as cryptomarkets and underground forums are publicly available (and hence there is an ethical case for data collection), but the illicit activity involved means that the administrators of these services limit scraping. We classify different anti-crawling techniques taken by websites and outline our developed countermeasures. Based on this, we evaluate which of these methods do and do not succeed at preventing data gathering from a website, as well as those which impact the scraper but do not necessarily prevent the data from being obtained. We find that there are some defences that, if used together, might thwart scraping. There are also a series of defences that are successful at slowing down scrapers, making historical scraping more difficult. On the other hand, we show that many defences are easy to work around and do not impact scraping.
Cybercrime commonly known as yahoo in Nigeria, and some parts of Africa, is one of the most formidable financial and security problems confronting Nigeria and the world today. The problem has become so significant that international organisations-including the United Nations- and developed countries are investing millions of Dollars and researching into understanding its manifestations and dynamics. Of particular concern is that cybercrime is very dynamic. And in places like Nigeria, it has moved from yahoo yahoo to yahoo plus indicating a high level of advancement in criminal activities law enforcement agencies and victims are yet to comprehend. While many previous researches have done much on cybercrime, our data suggest there is a need for more research as cybercrime continues to transform and this transformative innovation have largely made it difficult for significant success to be made in curbing the crime. Although much has been written on cybercrime, more needed to be known about yahoo plus especially the roles of the meaning, characterization and strategies. The empirical bases of this article are in-depth interviews with 15 yahoo boys and 30 community members in Nigeria-Africa's most populous country and one of the poorest countries in the world.
In this paper we have conducted a comprehensive measurement and analysis on the Dream market, an anonymous online market that uses cryptocurrency as transaction currency. We first collect data between October 30th 2018 and March 1st 2019. Then we use decision tree-based approach to classify goods. Following we analyze the category of goods sold in the market, the shipping place of vendors. By analyzing more than 1,970,303 items, we find the goods sold in Dream Market are mainly drugs and digital goods. We estimate the total sales of all vendors, and find that an average monthly income is $14 million during the measurement period, which means that the market commission income is more than $560,000 per month. Based on these data, we use transaction cost theory to analyze the transaction attributes of illegal transactions, which shows that anonymous online market can reduce transaction cost of illegal transactions. We finally discuss the results analyzed and the intervention policy, as well as recent DDoS attacks and future trends of illegal transactions in anonymous online market.
The ever expanding digital space and government initiatives like Digital India have increased connectivity, digitization, remote employment which empowered us with technology and made our lifestyle easy and fast but as digitization is enhancing, cyberattacks are proportionally growing. In the initial stage of this study, it was observed from the data analysis and it was evident that women are particularly a soft target of many cybercriminals and cyber fraudsters. Women feel insecure in cyberspace, hence there is a need to dive deeper into our understanding and statistics of cybercrimes against women in India. It becomes necessary to determine the factors that have led to the clear surge of such crimes in recent years. In recent studies no such analysis is done focusing on geographical factors and top most cybercrime types committed against women. Therefore, in this article, prediction for cybercrime trends against women was performed using statistical tools and techniques to provide a better insight into the current scenario revolving around cybercrimes and women. A regressive statistical analysis of cybercrime data of all states of India to understand the current trend of cybercrimes, identification of the most vulnerable states of India and specific cybercrime with their percentage in whole, also where cybercrime afflicted women stand in those numbers. Further, for preventive measures a robust guidelines is proposed to combat cybercrimes for a better future.
"Despite growing indications and fears about the impact of cybercrime, only few academic studies have so far been published on the topic to complement those published by consultancy firms, cybersecurity companies and private institutes. The review of all these studies shows that there is no consensus on how to define and measure cybercrime or its impact. Against this background, this article pursues two aims: 1) to develop a thorough conceptual framework to define and operationalize cybercrime affecting businesses as well as its impact, harms, and costs; and 2) to test this conceptual framework with a survey of businesses based in Belgium, which was administered in summer 2016 and elicited 310 valid responses. Consisting of five types, our conceptualization of cybercrime is, unlike others, technology-neutral and fully compatible with the legislation. Drawing on Greenfield and Paoli's Harm Assessment Framework (The British Journal of Criminology, 53, 864-885, 2013), we understand impact as the overall harm of cybercrime, that is, the sum of the harms to material support, or costs, and the harms to other interest dimensions i.e., functional (or operational) integrity, reputation and privacy. Whereas we ask respondents to provide a monetary estimate of the costs, respondents are invited to rate the severity of the harms on the basis of an ordinal scale. We claim that this double track gives a fuller, more valid assessment of cybercrime impact. Whereas most affected businesses do not report major costs or harm, 15% to 20% of them rate the harms to their internal operational activities as serious or more, with cyber extortion regarded as most harmful."
The COVID-19 outbreak and the far-reaching lockdown measures are having direct and indirect effects on complex social domains, including opportunities for crime offline and online. This paper presents preliminary analyses about the short-term effect of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on cyber-dependent crime and online fraud in the UK. Time series analyses from data about crimes known to police between May 2019 and May 2020 are used to explore the extent to which cybercrime has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. More specifically, we examine whether cybercrime has suffered an increase during the months with the strictest lockdown restrictions, as an effect of the displacement of crime opportunities from physical to online environments. Results indicate that reports of cybercrime have increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, and these were remarkably large during the two months with the strictest lockdown policies and measures. In particular, the number of frauds associated with online shopping and auctions, and the hacking of social media and email, which are the two most common cybercrime categories in the UK, have seen the largest increases in the number of incidents. The increase in cyber-dependent crimes has mainly been experienced by individual victims rather than organisations.
The expansion of the access to the Internet around the world has changed society as we know it. Having access to an unlimited source of information has changed the lives of individuals and communities. Even so, this new-found connectivity has created new risks. The Internet has enabled criminals to target data around the world and has put in reach critical infrastructure. Data breaches in companies affect millions threatening the privacy of people. Companies are exposed to big economic losses if they fail to protect their data. And in the military arena nations are preparing for cyberwar. From a defensive point of view is critical to predict and prepare systems against attacks. To help, this study analyses correlations between socio-economic factors and attacks. We want to confirm if there is a link that can help drawing patterns on attacks. To do that we will categorise cyber incidents and run a statistical correlation on them. Correlation does not imply causality but it helps further research on the causes of cybercrime.
The unprecedented changes in routine activities brought about by COVID-19 and the associated lockdown measures contributed to a reduction in opportunities for predatory crimes in outdoor physical spaces, while people spent more time connected to the internet, and opportunities for cybercrime and fraud increased. This article applies time-series analysis to historical data on cybercrime and fraud reported to Action Fraud in the United Kingdom to examine whether any potential increases are beyond normal crime variability. Furthermore, the discrepancies between fraud types and individual and organizational victims are also analyzed. The results show that while both total cybercrime and total fraud increased beyond predicted levels, the changes in victimization were not homogeneous across fraud types and victims. The implications of these findings on how changes in routine activities during COVID-19 have influenced cybercrime and fraud opportunities are discussed in relation to policy, practice, and academic debate.
"Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods are widely adopted across financial domains to support trading activities, mobile banking, payments, and making customer credit decisions. These methods also play a vital role in combating financial crime, fraud, and cyberattacks. Financial crime is increasingly being committed over cyberspace, and cybercriminals are using a combination of hacking and social engineering techniques which are bypassing current financial and corporate institution security. With this comes a new umbrella term to capture the evolving landscape which is financial cybercrime. It is a combination of financial crime, hacking, and social engineering committed over cyberspace for the sole purpose of illegal economic gain. Identifying financial cybercrime-related activities is a hard problem, for example, a highly restrictive algorithm may block all suspicious activity obstructing genuine customer business. Navigating and identifying legitimate illicit transactions is not the only issue faced by financial institutions, there is a growing demand of transparency, fairness, and privacy from customers and regulators, which imposes unique constraints on the application of artificial intelligence methods to detect fraud-related activities. Traditionally, rule based systems and shallow anomaly detection methods have been applied to detect financial crime and fraud, but recent developments have seen graph based techniques and neural network models being used to tackle financial cybercrime. There is still a lack of a holistic understanding of the financial cybercrime ecosystem, relevant methods, and their drawbacks and new emerging open problems in this domain in spite of their popularity. In this survey, we aim to bridge the gap by studying the financial cybercrime ecosystem based on four axes: (a) different fraud methods adopted by criminals; (b) relevant systems, algorithms, drawbacks, constraints, and metrics used to combat each fraud type; (c) the relevant personas and stakeholders involved; (d) open and emerging problems in the financial cybercrime domain."
Developing countries like Iraq have embraced digitalization and technology without proper legal measurement and implementation concerning the adverse outcomes, which has entangled Iraq in a crucial stage to take immediate actions against the negative aspect, i.e., cybercrimes. To address the current status of this issue, the study has investigated the legislative and administrative laws of cybersecurity to explore its limitations and provide suggestions for effective governance. This study has collected data qualitatively from the legislative experts of Iraq. The data was analyzed through NVIVO software, and transcription and thematic analysis were run. The analysis divided the data into four themes of different concepts. The findings have concluded several limitations prevailing and existing in the current laws. The theoretical and practical implications of the study have been discussed in the study.
For the last twenty years, there has been an increase in literature on cybercnnie due to growing awareness of its impact and economic cost. This literature is filled with debate by authors over the correlation between what has been dubbed cybercrime and 'terrestrial crime'. Some have claimed that although cybercrime may be a new and distinctive form of crime in principal it remains essentially like traditional crime. This argument suggests that traditional offenders have merely adjusted their tactics to utilize the advantages that cyberspace offers. However, other scholars argue that the uniqueness of the cyber environment creates key differences between cybercrimes and traditional crimes. These discrepancies can affect the applicability of general criminological theories previously used to explain terrestrial crimes. This research aims to identify the theoretical concerns surrounding the applicability of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) of crime in cyberspace, highlighting the practical issues related to such application. Prior to this, the present study seeks to define cybercrime, as well as provide a comprehensive description of RAT, emphasizing on the correlation between these two concepts.
Crime research has repeatedly shown that small proportions of offenders are responsible for large proportions of crimes. While there is a substantial body of evidence for this 'offending concentration' in connection to traditional offline crime, there is limited research assessing the concentration of offending for cybercrime. This research analyzes victim reports of Bitcoin-related cybercrimes (blackmail, ransomware, sextortion, darknet market fraud, Bitcoin tumbler fraud) to illuminate the extent of cybercrime offending concentration and to identify groups of offenders involved in online crime. Our results indicate that a large proportion of cybercrimes are associated with a small number of very active Bitcoin addresses. However, Bitcoin addresses associated to high numbers of reports are not necessarily those that generate the largest financial benefits.
The central question of this article is whether routine activity theory (RAT) can be used as an analytical framework to study cybercrimes. Both a theoretical analysis and an analysis of empirical studies have thus far failed to provide a clear answer. The multivariate analysis presented in this article tries to avoid some of the limitations of other RAT-based studies. Based on a large sample (N = 9,161), the effects of value, visibility, accessibility, and guardianship on victimization of six cybercrimes have been studied. Analysis shows some RAT elements are more applicable than others. Visibility clearly plays a role within cybercrime victimization. Accessibility and personal capable guardianship show varying results. Value and technical capable guardianship show almost no effects on cybercrime victimization.
Despite the advancement of cloud storage and the benefits it brings to computer users, it cannot be denied that cloud storage is still subject to misuse by malicious users and cyber criminals. This includes the cases where criminals use cloud storage for storing and exchanging illegal material and for committing botnet attacks. In addition, the increase in the number of cybercrimes against cloud services challenges the forensic process of locating and collecting cybercrime evidence in cloud storage. Although a number of researches are proposed to address cloud storage security, several studies and surveys reported that security in cloud computing still pose several concerns and challenges to the researchers. Loss of control over the data stored in cloud storage is one of the security challenges in that cloud. Moreover, location of stored data in the cloud and the multi tenancy of customers on cloud servers are all representing security concerns. At the same time, current cloud storage technology creates challenges for digital forensic practitioners in presenting and interpreting meaning to the obtained evidence to investigators, lawyers, and, ultimately, to the jury. This paper reviews the existing works in locating and collecting cybercrime evidence in cloud storage and provides an in-depth discussion of their limitations.
The study of topological indices for fuzzy graphs is beneficial for fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems and various connected fuzzy networks. In this paper, we discuss two fuzzy topological indices, namely fuzzy Randic index and fuzzy harmonic index. We establish several upper bounds for these fuzzy indices. We also present the lower bounds of these indices for different fuzzy products, i.e., Cartesian product, cross product and lexicographic product. These results and bounds are established in terms of parameters, like number of nodes, edges, minimum and maximum vertex and edge membership, etc. We also present an algorithm to determine Randic index of vertices of fuzzy graph. Finally, we implement our model of fuzzy Randic index in cybercrime problem for detection of more active criminal who is involved in many crimes with other criminals.
Cybercrime is recognized as one of the top threats to UK economic security. On a daily basis, the computer networks of businesses suffer security breaches. A less explored dimension of this problem is cybercrimes committed by insiders. This paper provides a criminological analysis of corporate insider victimization. It begins by presenting reviews of insider criminal threats and routine activities theory as applied to cybercrime. Analysis of the nationally representative Cardiff University UK Business Cybercrime Survey then informs statistical models that predict the likelihood of businesses suffering insider cyber victimization, using routine activities and guardianship measures as predictors.
The extant literature has demonstrated that there is a need for more empirical research on the subject of policing cybercrime. This article makes a contribution and offers a qualitative exploration of the problem of policing cybercrime from an international perspective. It structures the analysis around three main challenges: the knowledge, forensic, and legal challenges. A literature review supports the evidence that these issues are core challenges when policing cybercrime. Through 13 semi-structured interviews with cybercrime specialists from 8 countries, these three challenges are further investigated. A thematic analysis of the interviews, whilst confirming some of the previous literature findings, also outlines novel findings. Interview analysis shows that in some areas little recent progress has been made, in particular the recording of cybercrime. However, in other areas new creative solutions have been implemented, including filling the policing skills gap with civilian specialists. The article concludes by offering recommendations for addressing some of the challenges for policing cybercrime.
This article aims to forecast the information trends related to the most popular cyberattacks, seen as the cyber-crimes' consequences reflecting on the Internet. The study database was formed based on online users' search engine requests regarding the terms Cyberattacks on the computer systems of a financial institution, Cyberattacks on the network infrastructure of a financial institution, and Cyberattacks on the cloud infra-structure of a financial institution, obtained with Google Trends for the period from 16 April 2017 to 4 October 2022. The authors examined the data using the Z-score, the QS test, and the method of differences of average levels. The data were found to be non-stationary with outliers and a seasonal component, so exponential smoothing was applied to reduce fluctuations and clarify the trends. As a result, the authors built additive and multiplicative cyclical and trend-cyclical models with linear, exponential, and damped trends. According to the models' quality evaluation, the best results were shown by the trend-cyclic additive models with an exponential trend for predicting cyberattacks on computer systems and the cloud infrastructure and a trend-cyclic additive model with a damped tendency for predicting cyberattacks on the network infrastructure. The obtained results indicate that the U.S. can expect cybercrimes in the country's financial system in the short and medium term and develop appropriate countermeasures of a financial institution to reduce potential financial losses.
Cybercrime presents a myriad of challenges for law enforcement agencies, including the complexity and global nature of criminal activities, the difficulties in tracing activities within cyberspace, and the perpetual evolution of these unlawful practices. This article employs the conceptual framework of historical and discursive institutionalism to investigate the hurdles faced by the police in governing cybercrime in Spain. The study emphasizes the importance of situating law enforcement within the cybersecurity governance system to comprehend their challenges and adaptations. By analyzing 36 key documents, it argues that cybersecurity policies' origins and evolution were rooted in narratives focused on information protection and enhancing society's trust in digital technologies, narratives distinct from the discourse centered on cybercrime. The Spanish case study enriches the literature on cybersecurity governance by examining how historical evolution and narratives impact the roles of actors involved in the governance system.
With the development of information technology and Internet, the criminal model has been changed. The Internet has become an instrument of crime as a new type of criminal means, which is called cybercrime. Since the implementation methods are different between cybercrime and traditional crime, the crime evidences will also different. And the court judgments will be affected by the evidences, the results of judgment will also be different. Furthermore, the litigation proceedings used in the cybercrime and traditional crime are slightly different. It will affect the results of court judgment whether it is guilt or innocence. In this paper, we describe the common cybercrimes and the results of actual court judgement in Taiwan, collate the common evidence types of cybercrime, propose a cybercrime selection method used for court judgements to collect the judgements, analyze the statistics results, and compare the litigation processes between the traditional crime and cybercrime. According to the above results, we wish the judges process the cybercrime cases will be more careful to avoid misjudgements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
While crimes and cybercrimes have huge impact on both individuals and societies, we argue that the functional effect of cybercrime fear can play a significant role on adhering to the organizational security policy. The purpose of this paper is to set the stage for examining the influence of cybercrime fear on the employees' adherence to information security policies. Based on the fear of crime literature and the theory of planned behavior, we propose a model that integrates the fear of crime dimension from psychology and crime literature, with the adherence to information security policies.
This article offers a socio-technical framework for better understanding youthful attraction to, and engagement in, online transgressions and delinquencies. Specifically, it takes the concept of 'seduction' from the work of Katz, as well as 'affordance theory' and insights from software and human-computer interaction studies, to analyse the affordances of the Internet that tempt and invite youthful transgressions such as digital piracy, viewing illegal pornography and hacking. We argue that Internet affordances not only enable transgressions to occur but can also precipitate them. The implications for youth crime policy are briefly addressed. Policy needs to reckon with the power of these factors in adolescent lives and thus minimize reliance on punitive responses. The article also contributes to the development of the concept of digital drift, by showing how Internet features and affordances foster drift into cyber delinquency.
"Significant cybersecurity and threat intelligence analysts agree that online criminal activity is increasing exponentially. To offer an overview of the techniques and indicators to perform cyber crime detection by means of more complex machine-and deep-learning investigations as well as similar threat intelligence and engineering activities over multiple analysis levels (i.e., surface, deep, and darknets), we systematically analyze state of the art in such techniques. First, to aid the engineering and management of such intelligence solutions. We provide (i) a taxonomy of existing methods mapped to (ii) an overview of detectable criminal activities as well as (iii) an overview of the indicators and risk parameters that can be used for such detection. Second, to find the major engineering and management challenges and variables to be addressed. We apply a Topic Modelling Analysis to identify and analyze the most relevant threat concepts both in Surface and in Deep-, Dark-Web. Third, we identify gaps and challenges, defining a roadmap. Practitioners value and conclusions. The analysis mentioned above effectively provided a photograph of the scientific and practice gaps among the Surface Web and the Deep-, Dark-Web cybercrime and threat engineering and management. More specifically, our systematic literature review shows: (i) the dimensions of risk assessment techniques today available for the aforementioned areas-addressing these is vital for Law-enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime and cyber threats effectively; (ii) what website features should be used in order to identify a cyber threat or attack researchers and non-governmental organizations in support of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) should cover these features with appropriate technologies to aid in the investigative processes; (iii) what (limited) degree of anonymity is possible when crawling in Deep-, Dark Web-researchers should strive to fill this gap with more and more advanced degrees of anonymity to grant protection to LEAs during their investigations.& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Author(s).

The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented global challenge to the whole society. Previously, most of the physical activities were not conducted online and were not exposed to cybercrime. Thus, it necessitates paying attention to this emerging phenomenon and devising strategies for a safe online environment for all stakeholders. The current study presents a historical overview of cybercrime and the cybersecurity system and highlights cybercrimes' legal importance globally and cybercrime regulations during the Covid-19 times, specifically in the Indonesian context. Using a normative juridical approach, this study collected secondary data from various books, journals, regulatory guidelines, institutional reports, research, and the Internet. Additionally, a systematic literature search methodology was used to collect relevant secondary data from the most popular database, i.e., Scopus. Results revealed that although many nations are actively working to control cybercrimes, the issue persists, and many new cyber threats, i.e., scams and phishing, emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic. In such situations, along with the existence of a promising cybersecurity system, cybercitizens should always consider hygienic cyber tips to avoid being victims of cyber coronavirus crimes. Finally, after presenting an overview of the current state of cybercrime legislation on COVID-19, key policy recommendations for developed and developing countries are given, along with future research directions.
Governments need reliable data on crime in order to both devise adequate policies, and allocate the correct revenues so that the measures are cost-effective, i.e., the money spent in prevention, detection, and handling of security incidents is balanced with a decrease in losses from offenses. The availability of multiple contrasting figures on cyber-attacks checks the accurate assessment of the cost-effectiveness of current and future policies for cyber space. What factors contribute to the costing equation is not clearly understood with wide variation in methodologies used. The most relevant literature in this field is reviewed and analysed against quantitative insights provided by the CyberROAD survey to stakeholders. Research gaps are highlighted to determine the issues that need addressing to provide a solid ground for future legislative and regulatory actions at national and international levels.
The current research explored the predictors of how police officers perceived the importance of combatting cybercrime. This is an era in which industrial security is threatened by perpetrators who use advanced techniques to steal information online. Understanding how law enforcement officers view the control of cybercrimes, especially those that steal confidential business information, can inform industrial espionage prevention and help maintain a nation's industrial competitiveness in the world market. We surveyed a convenience sample of South Korean police officers attending training at the Police Human Resources Development Institute (PHRDI) using a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. The results indicated that the officers' perceptions of colleagues' and organizational views on cybercrime control significantly impacted their attitudes. Additionally, officers' perceptions of the seriousness of online theft (in this paper, we use the terms online theft and property cybercrime interchangeably) and their computer proficiency were also found to affect their views on the importance of combatting cybercrimes. We conclude by suggesting that the police take a proactive organizational approach to prevent and respond to online property crimes through education and public awareness programs, which could positively impact the prevention of industrial espionage.
"Criminal pro,ling is a useful technique to identify the most plausible suspects based on the evidence discovered at the crime scene. Similar to offline criminal pro,ling, in-depth pro,ling for cybercrime investigation is useful in analysing cyberattacks and for speculating on the identities of the criminals. Every cybercrime committed by the same hacker or hacking group has unique traits such as attack purpose, attack methods, and target. These unique traits are revealed in the evidence of cybercrime; in some cases, these unique traits are well hidden in the evidence such that it cannot be easily perceived. Therefore, a complete analysis of several factors concerning cybercrime can provide an investigator with concrete evidence to attribute the attacks and narrow down the scope of the criminal data and grasp the criminals in the end. We herein propose a decision support methodology based on the case-based reasoning (CBR) for cybercrime investigation. This study focuses on the massive data-driven analysis of website defacement. Our primary aim in this study is to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed methodology as a proof of concept. The assessment of website defacement was performed through the similarity measure and the clustering processing in the reasoning engine based on the CBR. Our results show that the proposed methodology that focuses on the investigation enables a better understanding and interpretation of website defacement and assists in inferring the hacker's behavioural traits from the available evidence concerning website defacement. The results of the case studies demonstrate that our proposed methodology is beneficial for understanding the behaviour and motivation of the hacker and that our proposed data-driven analytic methodology can be utilized as a decision support system for cybercrime investigation."
It is a well-known fact that the system is as secure as its weakest point. Often, organizations and countries invest in the technologies, forgetting that it is impossible to assure information security without raising awareness among users. Therefore, in this study, the cybercrime awareness rate of users in two Central Asian Countries was investigated. As a target group, students of two public universities from each country were chosen. Results of quantitative research showed that in Kazakhstan, gender and age of respondents affect the cybercrime awareness rate, while in Kyrgyzstan, none of the factors had an impact on this rate. Although there was a statistically significant difference in cybercrime awareness of users in terms of the country of residence, students in two Central Asian countries showed a little difference in information security knowledge, which is, in its own term, mostly depends on the computer literacy rate of students.
Discussions on underground forums provide valuable insights to hackers' practices, interests and motivations. Although Internet of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities have been extensively explored, the question remains how members of hacker communities perceive the IoT landscape. In this work, we present an analysis of IoT related discussions that are potentially cybercriminal in nature. In particular, we analyse forum threads that discuss the search engine Shodan. The source of these posts is the CrimeBB dataset provided by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre (CCC)(1). We analyse 1051 thread discussions from 19 forums between 2009 and 2020. The overall aim of our work is to explore the main use cases of Shodan and highlight hackers' targets and motivations. We find that Shodan is versatile and is actively used by hackers as a tool for passive information gathering providing easier access to hackable targets. Our results suggest that Shodan plays a prominent role in various specific use cases including remote control of target devices, building botnets, Distributed Denial of Service attacks and identifying open databases.
Cybercrime has exponentially increased in recent years as an unavoidable byproduct of greater internet use, generally, and presents a wide range of criminal threats to large companies and individuals alike. While cyber offenses (e.g., cyberharassment, cyberstalking, identity theft, and intellectual property theft) and their address have been examined across diverse academic disciplines including criminology, electrical engineering, sociology, and computer science, minimal consideration has been given to the role of e-government in combating cybercrime - a somewhat ironic oversight given the computerized context of both. After reviewing the nature of cybercrime, this chapter considers e-government policies addressing cybercrime awareness, prevention, and victimization services. Discussion centers on the prospects for cybercrime theoretical research program development toward best practices public policy.
In recent times, cloud computing has become one of essential computing paradigms. Several companies and organizations that aim of using a cloud computing technology worry about the migration of their work to the cloud computing. This is due to the data security issues where cybercrimes are representing a real problem for them because of the huge damage that can cause. This lead researchers and scientists to thinking about provide new procedures and strategies to fight and trace criminals and attackers. Besides investigating crimes related to the cloud environment in forensically sound manner, the process of performing cybercrime investigation in the cloud environment is known as cloud forensics. This process is facing complex challenges due to the dynamic nature of cloud computing. In this paper, a cloud forensic strategy is proposed for assisting digital investigators and experts for investigation of cybercrimes in effective and efficient manner. The proposed strategy is based on cloud computing platform that providing enormous processing and storage capabilities. This strategy can be as guided to the digital investigators and practitioners to follow it in performing of investigation of cybercrimes.
In recent times, the topic of content-based cybercrime has gained significant attention. It is the requirement of today's era for social media companies to meet the challenges faced in differentiating the oppressive content in both a precise and proficient manner, thereby securing their clients. This article proposes a novel cuckoo inspired stacking ensemble framework that is the integration of Cuckoo Search and several machine learning models. The proposed framework automatically seeks for near-optimal combinations of classification techniques along with their tuning parameters for efficiently solving the problem of content-based cybercrime detection. Four datasets obtained from Formspring, ASKfm, and Twitter are used for testing purposes. The experimental results showcased significant improvement in the performance of classification on all the datasets in comparison to state-of-art classification models. The success rate of the proposed model with the excellent recall is 0.984 via 10-fold cross-validation demonstrates its high efficiency and effectiveness.
"Purpose Cybercrime is the greatest threat facing law enforcement agencies in England and Wales. Although these crimes are transnational by nature, the burden of response has been placed on line officers. Not all officers, however, believe they are capable of responding to calls involving cybercrime. The current study, using latent class analysis (LCA) on a large sample of English and Welsh officers, finds two types of officers: those prepared (39 percent) and those unprepared (61 percent). Using logistic regression to predict who falls into either classification, the authors find that training and age are the best predictors of latent membership. Implications for policy and future research are discussed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors used LCA to determine the number and character of unobserved categories of officers in how they deal with cybercrime. Findings The LCA indicated there are two distinct categories of police in the English and Welsh constabulary: those prepared (39 percent) and those unprepared (61 percent). Training and age were the two key determinants of this classification. Research limitations/implications - LCA is an exploratory analysis technique that requires additional validation to confirm the findings of any one study. Practical implications - The salience of training in helping officers feel prepared to deal with cybercrime cases as well as victims was demonstrated. A full 60 percent of the officers in this study fell in the unprepared category, which continues to highlight the limitations of local police to handle cybercrime cases; nevertheless, almost 40 percent of officer could be considered ready when responding to cybercrimes. Social implications - As the harm cybercrime brings to our financial and social well-being, law enforcement agencies will be required to improve their response capabilities. Most current cybercrime responses address technical issues related to online fraud and abuse, but officers often perceive the problem as outside their legal and geographic jurisdiction. Knowing how officers perceive cybercrime as well as their own capabilities will allow us to begin changing enforcement policies, training capacity and individual response efficacy. Originality/value This study involved a sample of English and Welsh constables and sergeants to classify their cybercrime readiness. The analysis and particular data are unique to the study of cybercrime."
The wide acceptance of social networking sites motivates students to use it for entertainment, finding and chatting with friends, sharing photos and videos, post happenings and events in real-time. Presently, millions of students connect to social networking site every day. This makes the criminal elements in the society trick the students by using their information available on the social networking sites to commit crime against them. This research investigated the types of crimes that are committed to students on social networking sites. Also, the researchers investigated the ways and techniques used by these criminals to commit crime against the students. At the same time, the research also investigated the various ways and techniques the students can use to detect, prevent and also to mitigate the impact of such crimes against them. Literature review showed that mostly kidnapping, sexual harassment, bullying, credit card fraud and threatening crimes that are committed to students on social networking sites can be avoided. The various ways and techniques used by the criminal to commit crimes against the students such as identity theft, phishing, spam etc. were also identified. Similarly, the various techniques like parental controls used in Facebook, TheOneSpy monitoring app used in Whatsapp that are used to protect the students were discussed. At the same time, computer forensic data analysis techniques used to detect crime against the students was analyzed. The researchers hope that this paper would be a guideline to students, parents and teachers in protecting the students against the menace of social networking sites.
Cybercrime is a pressing concern for governments and businesses around the globe, but little is known about what policy interventions work to prevent and mitigate threats to organizations. Thus, empirical studies on cybercrime prevention policies and tools are needed to understand their effectiveness and to improve implementation and evaluation. This article analyzes whether two UK government schemes aimed at encouraging and helping businesses to adopt cybersecurity controls and policies ('Cyber Es-sentials' and '10 Steps to Cyber Security') are associated with safer organizational behavior and whether adopting the recommended measures is related to lower levels of cybercrime victimization and its im-pacts. Bayesian model averaging is employed on a representative sample of 5,872 businesses from four rounds (2018-2021) of the UK Government's Cyber Security Breaches Survey. The results show that awareness of the Government schemes is associated with more cyber secure practices, but we do not find evidence of lower likelihood of victimization or negative consequences for companies that implement the recommended measures. Findings are discussed in relation to policy, practice and future research.(c) 2023 The Author.

Cybercrime research suggests that, analogous to traditional crime, victims are more likely to be offenders. This overlap could be caused by shared risk factors, but it is unclear if these are comparable to traditional risk factors. Utilizing a high risk sample of computer-dependent cyber-offenders and traditional offenders (N = 535) we compare victimization, offending, and victimization-offending between cybercrime and traditional crime. Cybercrime results show a considerable victim-offender overlap and correlates like low self-control and routine activities partly explain differences in victimization, offending, and victimization-offending. Some cybercrime correlates are related to the digital context, but show similar patterns for cybercrime and traditional crime.
"This article analyses the emergence of a European Union policy on cybercrime from the perspective of comparative federalism. To this end, it draws on insights from federal polities to explain how policy-makers in the United States, Switzerland and the European Union have responded to the challenge posed by criminality on the internet and the impact of different federal structures on policy outcomes. Two claims are put forward: first, we expect to find similarities with regard to interactions among the different levels of government in all three units of analysis; second, we argue that differences in the capabilities of the centre help to account for the variance in policy outcomes. The main conclusion drawn is that although outcomes may vary in some notable respects, the dynamics of policy-making exhibit similarities that make comparison of the European Union with other federal polities particularly revealing."
Wildlife trafficking is driving many species to extinction and is overwhelming law enforcement efforts to stop it. At least a 2-fold increase in the number of traffickers who are put out of business is needed to help avoid these extinctions. A cybersecurity-based solution described in this article consists of a large international confederation of criminal investigators collecting intelligence on persons involved in wildlife trafficking, analyzing it, and then recommending to law enforcement (a) cybercriminals to detain, (b) cybercriminals to surveil, and (c) where and when to intercept cybercriminal-initiated wire transfers and shipments of wildlife products. Wildlife traffickers nowadays often use the internet to commit their cybercrimes. Prosecuting such crimes is challenging. Indeed, one of the top five challenges in cybersecurity is to develop methods for pursuing cybercriminals and bringing them to justice through the acquisition of digital evidence that links specific individuals to specific illegal acts. The proposed confederation finds two lists of wildlife cybercriminals to remove. The first is found by computing centrality measures on the statistically estimated (reconstructed) current social network of wildlife cybercriminals to identify those criminals whose removal would, according to social network theory, maximally disrupt the syndicate's operations. This list contains criminals identified as kingpins, and/or information brokers. The second list consists of those m criminals whose removal results in the largest simulator-computed drop in poaching of the trafficked species over the next year. Database access control is a form of information security (InfoSec), or data security-a chief component of cybersecurity. Here, a distributed form of information security is developed for keeping a confederation's criminal intelligence database secure from unauthorized access and insider threats. This procedure uses only peer-to-peer transactions. The illegal trade in rhino horn is used to illustrate how this confederation would use criminal intelligence from several countries to first build a simulation of the political-ecological system that contains the trafficking operation, and then use this statistically fitted simulator to identify those traffickers to remove, wire transfers to block, and wildlife product shipments to seize. All software to implement this federated database and its access control procedure is freely available.
Development of technologies brings many positive aspects that enhance the quality of citizen's life. In addition to the benefits, the development of technology brings about also new threats and risks. For this reason, the issue of cyber security and personal data protection is at present at the forefront. Since June 2018, the European Union regulation has been enacted to increase the level of protection of personal data and to strengthen the rights of the citizens of the European Union in this area. To increase cyber security, the Slovak Republic adopted a Cyber Security Act in 2018 which sets minimum requirements for ensuring cyber security. By this law, the Slovak Republic strives to protect its citizens against the threats that are on the Internet. Children, young people, and seniors are the most vulnerable to these threats. Their computer literacy and the possibilities of protection against threats on the Internet are minimal. Thus, the level of cyber security must be examined, including the analysis of the awareness of risk group and formulation of possibilities to educate them. Uploading and subsequent uncontrolled sharing of personal information, sensitive information, intrusive photos, and videos on the Internet can lead to cyberbullying, which poses the greatest threat to children and young people. The paper deals with the survey conducted among elementary school pupils in topic of cyber security awareness and threats of the Internet. The aim of the paper is to propose preventive activities and measures to cyberbullying protection and raise cyber security awareness.
Crime is a major social and legal problem in the world we live in. Crime changes with time and circumstances. Criminals use new technologies to facilitate and maximize criminal activities. With increased use of Computers and Internet, there has been an explosion of new crime called the Cybercrime which is also known as 'Internet crimes' or 'e-crime'. Cybercrime is the most complicated problem and it has become the major concern for the global community. It is hard to detect. The nature of cybercrime shows that investigations are often technically complex, requiring access to specialist skill. For detection of cybercrime many investigation techniques and methods are there in the system. Also many investigation models have been proposed. Till date the investigation models proposed by various researchers have some or the other shortfalls. An improvised cybercrime investigation model with detail phases has been proposed in this paper.
The Internet is used by international insurgents, jihadists, and terrorist organizations as a tool for radicalization and recruitment, a method of propaganda distribution, a means of communication, and ground for training. Although there are no known reported incidents of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure as acts of terror, this could potentially become a tactic in the future. There are several methods for countering terrorist and insurgent information operations on the Internet. In this paper, the Terrorist Attack dataset using three-layer neural network trained and it is evaluated LBK method with the classification. According to the results which are obtained through three-layer neural network approaches to the methods it has better compare performance.
In parallel with the exponentially growing number of computing devices and IoT networks, the data storage and processing requirements of digital forensics are also increasing. Therefore, automation is highly desired in this field, yet not readily available, and many challenges remain, ranging from unstructured forensic data derived from diverse sources to a lack of semantics defined for digital forensic investigation concepts. By formally describing digital forensic concepts and properties, purpose-designed ontologies enable integrity checking via automated reasoning and facilitate anomaly detection for the chain of custody in digital forensic investigations. This article provides a review of these ontologies, and investigates their applicability in the automation of processing traces of digital evidence. This article is categorized under: Digital and Multimedia Science > Artificial Intelligence Digital and Multimedia Science > Cybercrime Investigation Digital and Multimedia Science > Cyber Threat Intelligence
Computers and the Internet have become a vital part of modern life across the world, affecting communications, finance, and governance. At the same time, technology has created unparalleled opportunities for crime and deviance on- and off-line. Criminological research has expanded its focus over the last two decades to address the various forms of technology-enabled crime and the applicability of traditional theories to account for offending. There is, however, a need for careful consideration of the state of the field in order to identify issues requiring further study and analysis. This study examines the current literature on virtually all forms of cybercrime and the theoretical frameworks used to address these issues. In turn, we hope to give direction to refine our understanding of criminological theory and social policies to combat these offenses.
Botnets, networks of infected computers controlled by a commander, increasingly play a role in a broad range of cybercrimes. Although often studied from technological perspectives, a criminological perspective could elucidate the organizational structure of botnets and how to counteract them. Botnets, however, pose new challenges for the rather anthropocentric theoretical repertoire of criminology, as they are neither fully human nor completely machine driven. We use Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to provide a symmetrical perspective on human and non-human agency in hybrid cybercriminal networks and analyze a botnet case from this perspective. We conclude that an ANT lens is particularly suitable for shedding light on the hybrid and intertwined offending, victimization and defending processes, leading to the new concept of 'cyborg crime'.
Over the past decade, reports of cybercrime have soared across the globe. Criminologists agree that the increase in cybercrime stems from technological advancements that have changed all facets of societal interactions. While it is agreed that technology has shaped cybercrime, there is less understanding about the dynamics of cybercrime. In particular, some researchers have explored whether these offenses are simply traditional types of crime that are now carried out through different strategies, while others have argued that cybercrimes are, in fact, new types of crime. This ambiguity potentially limits prevention and intervention strategies. In an effort to build our understanding about cybercrime within a criminological framework, in this study we use labeling theory as a guide to examine the patterns, characteristics, and sanctions associated with a sample of cybercrimes with an aim towards identifying how these offenses are socially constructed in comparison to traditional crimes, white-collar crimes, and international crimes. In doing so, our hope is to further determine how cybercrime can be understood within current criminological thinking.
To enhance competition and choice in the domain name system, ICANN introduced the new gTLD program, which added hundreds of new gTLDs (e.g..nyc,.io) to the root DNS zone. While the program arguably increased the range of domain names available to consumers, it might also have created new opportunities for cybercriminals. To investigate that, we present the first comparative study of abuse in the domains registered under the new gTLD program and legacy gTLDs (18 in total, such as.com,.org). We combine historical datasets from various sources, including DNS zone files, WHOIS records, passive and active DNS and HTTP measurements, and 11 reputable abuse feeds to study abuse across gTLDs. We find that the new gTLDs appear to have diverted abuse from the legacy gTLDs: while the total number of domains abused for spam remains stable across gTLDs, we observe a growing number of spam domains in new gTLDs which suggests a shift from legacy gTLDs to new gTLDs. Although legacy gTLDs had a rate of 56.9 spam domains per 10,000 registrations (Q4 2016), new gTLDs experienced a rate of 526.6 in the same period-which is almost one order of magnitude higher. In this study, we also analyze the relationship between DNS abuse, operator security indicators and the structural properties of new gTLDs. The results indicate that there is an inverse correlation between abuse and stricter registration policies. Our findings suggest that cybercriminals increasingly prefer to register, rather than hack, domain names and some new gTLDs have become a magnet for malicious actors. ICANN is currently using these results to review the existing anti-abuse safeguards, evaluate their joint effects and to introduce more effective safeguards before an upcoming new gTLD rollout.
Globally, millions of people play video games online and interact without limits. In recent years, video games have gained popularity thanks to the recent covid-19 pandemic and have been used as a pastime against lockdowns. This environment is extremely easy to use, suitable for all ages, and without specific filters or barriers preventing access. Gaming online is, therefore, an essential part of video games, where users play with friends and explore the environment in cooperation. Children make up a large portion of the population using these platforms, and this environment has not always proved safe for them. Therefore, this contribution explores the safety of the gaming environment by reviewing the current security measures available in the industry and comparing them with the results of a survey carried out among children under 18.
WHOIS acts as a registry for organisations or individuals who own or take responsibility for domains. For any registry to be functional, its integrity needs to be assured. Unfortunately, WHOIS data does not appear to meet basic integrity requirements in many cases, reducing the effectiveness of law enforcement and rightsholders in requesting takedowns for phishing kits, zombie hosts that are part of a botnet, or infringing content. In this paper, we illustrate the problem using a case study from trademark protection, where investigators attempt to trace fake goods being advertised on Facebook. The results indicate that ICANN needs to at least introduce minimum verification standards for WHOIS records vis-a-vis integrity, and optimally, develop a system for rapid takedowns in the event that a domain is being misused.
Harmful cyberactivities pose an increasing threat to cybersecurity. As the legal response, the legislator steadily criminalised cyberactivities by amending the criminal code in 1997, 2009 and 2015. The article describes this process of criminalisation and analyses its features. First, cyberactivities have been categorised and dealt with differently. Second, not only the core acts the act of intruding into computer information systems, the act of damaging data in computer information systems and the act of committing other crimes by using the computer as a tool but also the activities of assisting in or preparing for committing those core acts have been criminalised. This reflects the nation's prevention-oriented attitude towards cybercrime.
In an increasingly digital world, our social interactions are increasingly moving online. Differential association and social learning theories suggest that we learn both moral definitions and the how-to of crime from those we associate with. In this paper we examine whether online or offline social learning leads to more self-disclosed forms of cyber-offending. Using a national online sample of 1,109 participants, we find both online and offline social learning are important correlates to cyber-offending. In addition, we predict that lower self-control will interact with social learning to further increase the likelihood of cyber-offending. Overall, we find that both social learning and self-control, individually and as an interaction, have a large effect-size in predicting cyber-offending.
Nowadays, people are heading towards an era where the use of personal devices such as Personal Digital Assistant, laptops and wireless networks is increasing. Users operate their personal devices to gain benefit from resources and services offered by the Internet. Sometimes, these Internet activities are susceptible to cybercrimes and their consequences can be as harmful as common physical crime. Cyber-criminals use fake geographical locations to commit frauds and easily get away without eroding their anonymity. The geographical location information should be mandatory to gain access control. Authentication of user's geographical location (geolocation) can be helpful in enhancing network security and control access to resources. In this paper, IP address is used to authenticate user's graphical location and some of its extended properties which can be used as a weapon to avoid users from entering fake geographical locations while using Internet services, so as to improve safety and decreasing cybercrimes. The proposed model takes proactive investigations to uncover cybercrimes and cyber-criminals who are actively engaged in cybercrime.
The revolution in the Information Technology (IT) field has led to a significant increase in the number of people connected to and utilizing the Internet. However, it has also introduced severe security risks: valuable information such as passwords, financial accounts, and other confidential data are considered attractive targets for attackers. Cyber-attacks against this infrastructure can not only lead to data leakage but can also have significant financial implications and even lead to loss of life. Consequently, to defend against such attacks, and considering humans have a key role in these technologies, it is important to increase cyber-security awareness. This paper focuses on measuring the current level of cyber-security awareness in Saudi Arabia, in terms of cyber-security practices, level of awareness, and incident reporting, by means of an online questionnaire with 1230 participants. The questionnaire results showed that 31.7% used public Wi-Fi to access the Internet,51% used their personal information to create their passwords, 32.5% did not have any idea about phishing attacks, 21.7% had been victim of cybercrimes while only 29.2% of them reported the crime, which reflects their levels of awareness. The paper concludes by offering recommendations based on analysis of the results topromote the level of awareness.
"Cybercrime is notoriously maintained and empowered by the underground economy, manifested in black markets. In such markets, attack tools and vulnerability exploits are constantly traded. In this paper, we focus on making a quantitative assessment of the risk of attacks coming from such markets, and investigating the expected reduction in overall attacks against final users if, for example, vulnerabilities traded in the black markets were all to be promptly patched. In order to conduct the analysis, we mainly use the data on (a) vulnerabilities bundled in 90+ attack tools traded in the black markets collected by us; (b) actual records of 9 x 10(7) attacks collected from Symantec's Data Sharing Programme WINE. Our results illustrate that black market vulnerabilities are an important source of risk for the population of users; we further show that vulnerability mitigation strategies based on black markets monitoring may outperform traditional strategies based on vulnerability CVSS scores by providing up to 20% more expected reduction in attacks."
In the context of the digitization of delinquent activities, perpetrated via the internet, the question of the most appropriate means of crime prevention and crime repression is once again being raised. Studies performed on police investigations have highlighted the over-determining nature of circumstantial factors in crime as a condition for their elucidation for more than fifty years. The emergence of mass delinquency, such as cybercrime, has thus strongly altered the role of investigation as a useful mode of knowledge production. This obsolescence has appeared gradually and can be summarized in four stages, which generates a suspicion about the social relevance of the investigation. It seems that the holistic approach of criminal intelligence is more adapted to the fight against new forms of crime. The investigation becomes a precision instrument assigned to functions that become more specific. This article considers this paradigm shift by the approaches to knowledge management of crime control. Cybercrime is then emblematic of this shift. This study is based on the criminological review and the delinquency analysis led by the central criminal intelligence service of the national gendarmerie. Its premise may likely guide the strategy of French law enforcement agencies.
Given the limited resources and capabilities of states to maintain cyber security, a variety of co-production efforts have been made by individuals or by collectives, of varying degrees of organization and coordination. This article identifies different forms of citizen co-production of cyber security and notes the risk of unintended consequences. Safeguards and principles are proposed in order to facilitate constructive citizen/netizen co-production of cyber security. Although co-production of security can contribute to social control, only those activities within the bounds of the law should be encouraged. Activities of private citizens/netizens that test the limits of legality should be closely circumscribed.
With the advent of Internet technology and World Wide Web WWW), the whole world has become a global village. In this globally connected world, information system becomes the unique empire without tangible territory. Cybercrime is any illegal action which performs knowingly or unknowingly to not disturb or disturb the system to get information using technology. Cybercrime is one of the negative results of globalization. No system is fully secured in this global village. It is unrealistic to divide information systems into segments bordered by state boundaries. So it is required to build a legal system for this global village. But till now this type of law does not come into its existence. As we know, India has third largest number of Internet users in the world. This paper is a study of cyber safety in India through modeling and analysis. We also studied cyber-insurance companies in India.
The peculiarity of the modern economy is related to its informational character which affects the sharp increase of cyber incidents in the field of information security that are widespread and becoming threatening and are relevant to a broad range of private, corporate, as well as state interests. The problem of forming an effective information security system is exacerbated by the spread of cybercrime as a leading threat to information security, both in Ukraine and throughout the world. Thus, World Economic Crime Survey shows that almost every third organization faces economic offenses, of which about a third are the cybercrimes. The paper analyzes the data of two main indicators of the country's cybersecurity: Global Cybersecurity Index and the National Cybersecurity Index. According to the first one, some indicators of the Index in contemporary Ukraine became problematic. These are as follows: the absence of sectoral cybersecurity centers, the lack or low standards of cybersecurity of organizations and professional standards in this field, Internet safety for children, and the practical implementation of activities. The results of the analysis of the main indicators of the National Cybersecurity Index make it possible to state that the leading shortcomings in the field of cyber defense for Ukraine are: the lack of protection of digital services, the lack of crisis management in the field of cyber crisis management, the lack of effective military cyber operations. Summarizing the foregoing, the most acute problems of ensuring the proper level of cyber security of Ukraine are identified, which are as follows: the lack of appropriate specialists in the field of cybersecurity, the lack of unification of the categorical apparatus in the legislation of the country in the field of cybercrime, the lack of standards of cybersecurity in organizations and professional standards in this field, the absence of sectoral cybersecurity centers, the lack of recognized national comparative analysis and reference for measuring cybersecurity, and finally, the severity of identification, investigation and disclosure of cybercrime. In order to overcome certain shortcomings, the conceptual ways of solving the problem of ensuring cybersecurity have been proposed and characterized, which mainly consist in improving the legal and organizational support for the information and cyber security of Ukraine.
On 17 November 2021 the Second Additional Protocol to the Convention on enhanced cooperation and disclosure of electronic evidence was adopted by the Council of Europe. Through this Protocol it is hoped to strengthen judicial cooperation mechanisms including direct cooperation with service providers and joint investigation teams. Considering this development, this chapter mainly focuses on how the Council of Europe and its Member States primarily used soft law as an effective tool to influence policy as regards transborder access to online evidence in criminal matters. Starting with the 2001 Cybercrime Convention that does not explicitly provide for unilateral transborder access to data, this chapter encourages the reader to witness an intentional evolution from its original provisions to the adoption of soft law instruments such as different recommendations, and more importantly, guidance notes, which have eventually led to the momentum of adopting a Protocol. The chapter reflects on the agenda being pushed through these soft law instruments: to eventually expand on the interpretation of 'domestic reach' vis-a-vis electronic evidence in criminal matters. While laudable in terms of promoting efficiency, the law enforcement-centric greenlighting has its obvious pitfalls, one of which is the want of contribution to the promotion of better standards and protections for data protection and other relevant rights.
The internet mafia trope has shaped our knowledge about organised crime groups online, yet the evidence is largely speculative and the logic often flawed. This paper adds to current knowledge by exploring the development, operation and demise of an online criminal group as a case study. In this article we analyse a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) stresser (also known as booter) which sells its services online to enable offenders to launch attacks. Using Social Network Analysis to explore the service operations and payment systems, our findings show a central business model that is similar to legitimate e-commerce websites in the way product, price and costumers are differentiated. It also illustrates that its organisation is distributed and not hierarchical and the overall income yield is comparatively low, requiring further organisational activity to make it pay. Finally, we show that the users of the service (mainly offenders) are not only a mixed group of actors, but that it is also possible to discriminate between different levels of seriousness of offending according to the particular service they purchased.
This Article explains why and how computer technology complicates the related processes of identifying internal (crime and terrorism) and external (war) threats to social order of responding to those threats. First, it divides the process-attribution-into two categories: what-attribution (what kind of attack is this?) and who-attribution (who is responsible for this attack?). Then, it analyzes, in detail, how and why our adversaries' use of computer technology blurs the distinctions between what is now cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and cyberwarfare. The Article goes on to analyze how and why computer technology and the blurring of these distinctions erode our ability to mount an effective response to threats of either type. Finally, it explores ways in which we can modify how we currently divide responsibility for identifying and responding to the three threat categories among law enforcement and the military, respectively. The goal here is to identify techniques we can use to improve attribution and response processes for emerging cyberthreats.
The reform of the Crime Survey of England and Wales (a national victim survey) has exposed a very high number of individuals who fall victim to computer misuse cybercrimes such as hacking, computer viruses and ransomware. These crimes receive very little attention from the criminal justice system and very few are brought to justice, partly because of the nature of them (global crimes), but also because of a lack of capability among the police. This paper draws on official statistics, an empirical survey and interview research with computer misuse victims. The paper juxtaposes the low priority and lack of resources given to this crime by political and police leaders against many victims' perceptions and experiences of the crime as equivalent if not more serious than physical counterparts such as burglary, where there is greater interest. The increasing prominence of the virtual world in human life and the impacts of these crimes call for a reappraisal of the official assessment of seriousness in order to raise the priority and increase the capacity of criminal justice towards such offences.
Most of cyberscam-related studies focus on threats perpetrated against the Western society, with a particular attention to the USA and Europe. Regrettably, no research has been done on scams targeting African countries, especially Nigeria, where the notorious and (in)famous 419 advanced-fee scam, targeted towards other countries, originated. However, as we know, cybercrime is a global problem affecting all parties. In this study, we investigate a form of advance fee fraud scam unique to Nigeria and targeted at Nigerians, but unknown to the Western world. For the study, we rely substantially on almost two years worth of data harvested from an online discussion forum used by criminals. We complement this dataset with recent data from three other active forums to consolidate and generalize the research. We apply machine learning to the data to understand the criminals' modus operandi. We show that the criminals exploit the socio-political and economic problems prevalent in the country to craft various fraud schemes to defraud vulnerable groups such as secondary school students and unemployed graduates. The result of our research can help potential victims and policy makers to develop measures to counter the activities of these criminal groups.
'Cybercrime' is an umbrella concept used by criminologists to refer to traditional crimes that are enhanced via the use of networked technologies (i.e. cyber-enabled crimes) and newer forms of crime that would not exist without networked technologies (i.e. cyber-dependent crimes). Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term 'cybersecurity' typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of 'high' and 'low' policing (Brodeur, 2010) to suggest it would be useful to consider 'crime' and 'security' on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of 'low' policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of 'high' policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber-crime and cyber-security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.
Rogue websites support their operations through advertising, where advertising networks facilitate the placement of advertising banners paid for by advertisers who seek the most relevant eyeballs. While mainstream advertisers risk harm to their brands by being associated with illicit activities on the internet, they also risk harms to users through the colocation of ads for high-risk activities, such as gambling, pornography, and scams. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of high risk and mainstream advertising being served to New Zealand consumers. We explore the ethical challenges facing advertisers and advertising networks in potentially facilitating cybercrime and harms to users, in the context of theories of marketing ethics. These theories can be used to explore policy and individual responses to guide ethical conduct in marketing.
This study investigates the predictors of four types of cybercrime victimization/experiences: online harassment, hacking, identity theft, and receiving nude photos or explicit content. The effects of victimization opportunity and low self-control are examined as the primary independent variables in logistic regression analyses of data collected from a large sample of undergraduates enrolled at two universities in the United States. Results suggest that opportunity is positively related to each of the four types of online victimization, and that low self-control is associated with person-based, but not computer-based, forms of cybercrime. These findings speak to the utility, and also the limitations, of these perspectives in understanding cybercrime victimization risk among college students, and to the potentially criminogenic nature of the Internet.
The development of internet technologies is paralleled by the higher number of cyberattacks and cyber crimes in cyber-environment. Also, the growth in internet transactions has increased the number of cyber crimes, due both to the ingenuity of cyber criminals, but also to the lack of knowledge of users that make online transitions of how to protect themselves. There is no secret that cyber-weapons are tools of the modern war, so users of the internet should know how to deal with such attacks, preferably to prevent them but in case they happen, they should know what to do. Even though there are plenty of effects of cyber-crime effects on users' personal lives, the focus in this paper is on how cyber criminality affects business and forces owners and managers of various firms to invest in cyber protection. In the context of WannaCry ransomware attacks most companies around the world fear that they might become victims of this type of ransomware, considering the size and importance of affected organizations: NHS (UK's National Health Service), Automobile Dacia (Romania's biggest car producer), Deutsche Bahn AG (German national railway company), and many other organizations including universities and ministries. This exploratory study aims at determining if the Romanian managers and business owners are aware of the threats of cyber crime and what measures they take for protection. Also, the authors want to analyze if the companies chosen for this study have ever been victims of any cyber attacks and what were the costs for the shareholders. The results of this study will be useful for many organizations, and hopefully, they will put into practice the recommendations given at the end of this paper so that such cyber attacks will produce fewer victims in the future.
The aim of this chapter is to raise awareness of some of the legal issues around open source investigations of cybercrime and cyberterrorism. The issues raised relate to different stages of the investigation process and highlight instances within each where various types of legislation may affect the activities carried out, or the progress of a case. Rather than attempt to provide an in-depth legal analysis, the author uses UK and European law to illustrate difficulties that may be encountered or factors that may need to be considered in this particular type of investigation. General issues of data protection and human rights are outlined and addressed and more specific topics such as lawful actions, disclosure and digital evidence are explored. The chapter also considers the reasons behind the legal issues and suggests some ways that problems may be overcome.
"Purpose Retailers are implementing technology-enabled mobile checkout processes in their stores to improve service quality, decrease labor costs and gain operational efficiency. These new checkout processes have increased customer convenience primarily by providing them autonomy in sales transactions in that store employee interventions play a reduced role. However, this autonomy has the unintended consequence of altering the checks and balances inherent in a traditional employee-assisted checkout process. Retailers, already grappling with shoplifting, with an estimated annual cost of billions of dollars, fear that the problem may be exacerbated by mobile checkout and concomitant customer autonomy. The purpose of this paper is to understand the effect of mobile checkout processes in retail stores on cybercrime in the form of shoplifting enabled by a technology transformed the retail environment. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an online survey of a US sample recruited from a crowdsourced platform. The authors test a research model that aims to understand the factors that influence the intention to shoplift in three different mobile checkout settings - namely, smartphone checkout settings, store-provided mobile device checkout settings, and employee-assisted mobile checkout settings - and compare it with a traditional fixed location checkout setting. Findings The authors found that, in a smartphone checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs and peer influence had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters; in a store-provided mobile devices checkout setting, experiential beliefs had a negative effect on shoplifters' intention to shoplift and the effect was weaker for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters. The results also indicated that in an employee-assisted mobile checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters. Originality/value This study is the among the first, if not first, to examine shoplifters' intention to shoplift in mobile checkout settings. We provide insights into how those who may not have considered shoplifting in less favorable criminogenic settings may change their behavior due to the autonomy provided by mobile checkout settings and also provide an understanding of the shoplifting intention for both prospective and experienced shoplifters in different mobile checkout settings."
Objective Aiming to reduce distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by alerting the consciences of Internet users, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of four warning banners displayed as online ads (deterrent-control, social, informative, and reorienting) and the contents of their two linked landing pages. Methods We implement a 4 x 2 quasi-experimental design on a self-selected sample of Internet users to measure the engagement generated by the ads and the pages. Engagement is measured on the ads as the ratio of clicks to impressions and on the pages as percentage of page scrolled, average session duration, video interaction rate, and URLs click rate. Results Social ads generate significantly more engagement than the rest with low to medium effect sizes. Data reveal no differences in engagement between both landing page designs. Conclusions Social messages may be a better alternative for engaging with potential cyber offenders than the traditional deterrent messages.
This study investigates the victim-perpetrator overlap for financial cybercrimes: auction fraud, virtual theft, and identity fraud. Conducting a cross-sectional study among Dutch youth aged 10 to 18 (N = 6,299), the results show that the victim-perpetrator overlap for financial cybercrime is considerable. Perpetration is strongly motivated by retaliation. The findings from the multinomial regression model show that low self-control and high on-line disinhibition are positively and significantly associated with victimization and perpetration. The findings demonstrate that the overlap between financial cybercrime victimization and perpetration is partially explained by retaliation, low self-control and on-line disinhibition, suggesting that state-dependency and individual heterogeneity explanations should be supplemented by explanations funded in the dynamics of the on-line environment.
The concept of organised cybercrime has been the subject of much debate over the last decade. Many researchers who have applied scholarly definitions of organised crime to cyber-criminal groups have concluded that such groups are not organised criminal groups and do not engage in organised crime. This paper adopts a different perspective to argue that certain cyber-criminal groups involved in ransomware can and should be considered organised crime if a more contemporary and flexible framework for conceptualising organised crime is adopted. We make this argument using three primary domains of organised crime first described by von Lampe: criminal activities, offender social structures, and extra-legal governance. We narrow in on the concepts of violence and extra-legal governance in particular as they have been interpreted to hold significant differences for criminal groups operating in physical and digital domains. The paper argues that it is time to move on from criminological debates regarding whether organised cybercrime can exist to focus on the many rich questions that researchers can take from organised crime scholarship and apply to cyber-criminal groups. We put forward a reconceptualisation of organised cybercrime towards this end.
Over the last few years the market for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks has changed from a pay-per-attack model executed by botnets, to a subscription service of booters and stressers where subscribers launch their own attacks through a web-based front end. The DDoS attack strength of booters and stressers has significantly increased to rival that of the largest botnets, making them an ideal resource for attacks. The size of attacks offered depends on reflection and amplification (DRDoS) attacks where vulnerable servers are used to reflect attacks towards their victim. This increases the volume of attack traffic, while masking the source of the attack from the victim. To better understand this new form of cybercrime as a service, this study provides a comparative analysis of 155 unique reflective attacks performed by 21 DRDoS service providers against a real target. The underlying infrastructure of reflection servers was analyzed across the different providers, along with the type of attacks advertised relative to the actual type of attacks launched. The findings demonstrate there are distinct differences in the quality and capacity of service providers, and the language in posted advertisements does not necessarily conform to the realities of their real-time attacks. Implications for the disruption and mitigation of booter services are discussed in detail.
"The popularity of online social networks has created massive social communication among their users and this leads to a huge amount of user-generated communication data. In recent years, Cyberbullying has grown into a major problem with the growth of online communication and social media. Cyberbullying has been recognized recently as a serious national health issue among online social network users and developing art efficient detection model holds tremendous practical significance. In this paper, we have proposed set of unique features derived from Twitter; network, activity, user, and tweet content, based on these feature, we developed a supervised machine learning solution for detecting cyberbullying in the Twitter. An evaluation demonstrates that our developed detection model based on our proposed features, achieved results with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.943 and an f-measure of 0.936. These results indicate that the proposed model based on these features provides a feasible solution to detecting Cyberbullying in online communication environments. Finally, we compare result obtained using our proposed features with the result obtained from two baseline features. The comparison outcomes show the significance of the proposed features.

This study provides a partial test of the relationship between actor motivations and target suitability using a routine activity framework to understand a form of cybercrime called web defacements. Specifically, the relationships between the visibility, inertia, value, and accessibility of the target in online spaces relative to the unique nonmonetary motivations of the attacker were examined. This study utilized a sample of 138,361 web defacements performed against websites hosted within the Netherlands IP space from January 2011 to April 2017. Seven multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each self-identified motive for the attack, clustered by attacker to minimize the size of standard errors. The findings demonstrated partial support for aspects of routine activity theory to account for differences in offender motivation, suggesting web defacements are similar to other forms of cybercrime. At the same time, motivations differentially shape target selection.
Today, the internet is being used in everybody's daily life thanks to rapid development of science and technology including information and communications technology. The cyberspace has also been used as a den for cybercriminals, whose recent number remarkably increases getting things worse and worse. Cybercrime is technically distinguished from traditional one, which makes it very hard to investigate cybercrime. In particular, a number of technical and legal issues arising in the collection and analysis of digital evidence have great influence in cybercrime investigation. The paper explores general concept of electronic evidence, basic requirements for collecting and analysing digital evidence and general procedures and methodologies thereof.
The manuscript is devoted to the peculiarities of the application of criminal legal measures against cybercrimes under martial law. During the research, we found an opportunity to formulate the author's recommendations for solving the most complex problems of law enforcement, as well as to propose changes to the Criminal Code of Ukraine, aimed at eliminating the shortcomings of the analyzed Law, the adoption of which will contribute to the achievement of greater effectiveness of the relevant criminal law prescriptions.
Blockchain forensics (the use of scientific methods to manipulate data to create useful and informative descriptions of the manipulated data) takes data from the blockchain to interpret the flow of digital assets. Investigators use sophisticated data manipulation and visualization tools to identify the travel history of stolen assets. With these capabilities, chain hopping, round-tripping, and all attempts to blur transfer trails by cyber criminals become smoke screens with no effect. This paper establishes a framework for investigating financial crimes on the blockchain, starting with a brief explanation of blockchain forensics, types of financial crimes committed by criminals using the blockchain, and how they can be mitigated using OSINT's (OSINT, 2022) investigation process of data collection, data preservation, data processing, and data presentation. This paper also presents a community-based approach to financial crime investigations on the blockchain that involves the public and victims themselves contributing valuable intelligence that can be used to trace and track criminals by authorities and security agencies in the global fight against cybercrime.
The BitTorrent client application is a popular tool to distribute the large files over the Internet. However, the utility can be used for the illegal distribution of some files. Such an activity is considered as a cybercrime. In order to aid the forensics investigator to fight against the cybercrimes we carried out the research, during which we investigated the evidences left by BitTorrent client application in the local computer operating under Windows 8.1. During the experiment, we studied the evidences left by the BitTorrent client in the Windows registry and in the BitTorrent client configuration files. We investigated as well the possibilities to remove the evidences of the use of the BitTorrent application in order to conceal such a fact. The experiment revealed that the evidences are left either in the Windows registry or in the BitTorrent configuration files or both depending on the removal mode of the BitTorrent client application. The BitTorrent configuration files can reveal only whether the cybercrime was committed.
"Cybercrimes have increased with the increased use of computers. Measures have been developed at the national level to address the cybercrime issues; however, due to the nature of the crime, there is a need to adopt global frameworks. Various nations have developed internal legal measures to prevent cybercrime. The success of the measures can be fully effective through global integration. The international conventions have been developed to bring nations together and ensure that they join hands in fighting cybercrime. This paper addresses the history and introduction of cybercrime and their implications at the global level. Also, it analyzes the various measures used in addressing the crime and the challenges faced. Based on the analysis, the future of cybercrime can be easily analyzed to determine based on the effectiveness of the existing measures and policies governing cyber criminology and justice systems globally."
As a sequel to the liberalization of the Nigerian telecommunication sector in late 1990s, Nigeria experienced tremendous growth in telecommunications usage and internet penetration because of the proliferation of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Cybercafes. Consequently, fraudsters started using the internet, instead of the regular mails and fax to perpetrate crimes on cyberspace. International and domestic reports adjudged Nigeria as major global hub of cyber criminal activity, being one of the countries with the highest rates of cybercrime perpetration in the world. The Nigerian government became alarmed with the misuse of the cyberspace by the fraudsters and based on the quest to tackle the menace inaugurated in 2003 a Presidential Committee and subsequent initiatives to investigate the activities of these fraudsters on cyberspace and fashion out a legal and regulatory framework to circumvent the menace of cybercrime. Unfortunately, it took the Nigerian government over a decade to enact a cybercrime legal and regulatory framework after being exposed to the severe negative implications for national economic development, national security, international relations and also human rights and human security. This paper examines Nigeria's legal and regulatory response to cybercrime. It espouses an analysis of the adequacy of the legal and regulatory frameworks in existence to curtail cybercrime in Nigeria. (C) 2017 Felix E. Eboibi. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Governments needs reliable data on crime in order to both devise adequate policies, and allocate the correct revenues so that the measures are cost-effective, i.e., the money spent in prevention, detection, and handling of security incidents is balanced with a decrease in losses from offences. The analysis of the actual scenario of government actions in cyber security shows that the availability of multiple contrasting figures on the impact of cyber-attacks is holding back the adoption of policies for cyber space as their cost-effectiveness cannot be clearly assessed. The most relevant literature on the topic is reviewed to highlight the research gaps and to determine the related future research issues that need addressing to provide a solid ground for future legislative and regulatory actions at national and international levels.
Purpose The teenager community is the most affected community by cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Increasing social networks and facilitating teenager access to the Internet have increased the probability of cybercrimes. On the other hand, entertainment such as mobile and computer games is top-rated among teenagers. Teenagers' tendency to cybercrime may be influenced by individual, parent, social, economic and political factors. Studying the impact of social networks, mobile games and parents' religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is the primary goal of this paper. Design/methodology/approach The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a considerable change in the world and the lifestyle of all people. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was also affected by the special conditions of this virus. Changes in ICT and rapid access to it have empowered individuals and organizations, and people have increased civic participation and interaction through ICT. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created new challenges for the government and citizens and may cause new crimes. Cybercrime is a type of crime that occurs in a cyber environment. These crimes range from invasions of privacy to crimes in which the offender vaguely paralyzes the macroeconomic. In this research, 265 students of high schools and universities are used for collecting data by utilizing a survey. Measuring actions have been done in all surveys employing a Likert scale. The causal pattern is assessed through a constructional equation modeling procedure to study the scheme's validity and reliability. Findings The outcomes have indicated that social networks have no significant relationship with teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Mobile games have a mild effect on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era, and parents' religious attitudes significantly impact teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications Current research also has some restrictions that must be noticed in assessing the outcomes. First, sample research was selected from high schools and universities in one city. So, the size of the model is small, and the generalization of results is limited. Second, this research may have ignored other variables that affect the tendency of teenagers' to cybercrime. Future researchers intend to investigate the parents' upbringing system's impact on teenager's trend to cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Future research can also examine practical factors such as parental upbringing, attitudes toward technology development and virtual addiction in the COVID-19 era. Originality/value In this study, teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is investigated, and a procedure is applied depending on a practical occasion. This article's offered sample provides a perfect framework for influencing parents' social networks, mobile games and religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era.
Each medium we know of is defined by 1) the grammar which defines it and 2) the regulatory approach which definer it. Yet Cyberspace has introduced new harms and new crimes which have never before existed while some crimes have pre-existing antecedents. Regulation over the Internet may be based upon new harms. Rather than physical harm per se, the realm of psychological violation may provide the basis for a cause of action, yet we still speak in terms of physical or corporeal impact. What is the nature of punishment when liability or guilt is found to Exist and who metes out such punishment? This article proposes a typology of criminal behavior in cyberspace.
In recent years, cyber-racketeering has become a prevalent means of cyberattack, severely jeopardizing nations, organizations, and individual users. However, because previous research has been focused on individual crimes, insider security threats, and compliance, the serious consequences of organized cybercrimes have received little attention. To investigate organized cyber-racketeering, we explore how organized cybercriminals apply organizational techniques to systematically commit cyberattack on individuals and businesses. Based on 80 court cases of successfully prosecuted cybercrimes, this article is one of the first to scientifically examine organized crime syndicates that are engaged in cyber-racketeering. We use the grounded theory approach to investigate organized cyber-racketeering. To ensure the scientific rigor and realism of this study, we examine these court cases to develop a process theory based on the results of interpretive and iterative analyses conducted from multiple perspectives on organized cyber-racketeering. We establish a framework for organized cyber-racketeering to shed light on its characteristics and the crucial role of Internet technology (IT) in the implementation and operation of cyber-racketeering activities. The proposed framework consists of motive, organization, learning and development, and execution. This article contributes both to enhancing the understanding of how organized cybercriminals operate and profit from cyber-racketeering using information and communications technology (ICT) and to improving countermeasures that may be taken by practitioners.
The rapidly rising usage of telecommunication and information networks which inter-connect modern society through computers, smart phones and other electronic devices has led to security threats and cyber-crimes (CC) activities. These cybercrime activities has ultimately resulted in CC attack classification as a serious problem in network security domain while machine learning has been subjected to extensive research area in intrusion classification with emphasis on improving the rate of classifier's accuracy or improving the data mining model performance. This study is another attempt, using rough set theory (RST), a rule based decision making approach to extract rules for intrusion attacks classification. Experiments were performed on publicly available data to explore the performance of four different algorithms e.g. genetic algorithm, covering algorithm, LEM2 and Exhaustive algorithms. It is observed that RST classification based on genetic algorithm for rules generation yields best performance as compared to other mentioned rules generation algorithms. Moreover, by applying the proposed technique on publicly available dataset about intrusion attacks, the results show that the proposed approach can fully predict all intrusion attacks and also provides prior useful information to the security engineers or developers to conduct a mandating action.
"Since a past decade, social media networking has become an essential part of everyone's life affecting cultural, economic and social life of the people. According to internetlivestats.com, in March 2019 the Internet users reached 4 168 461 500, i.e., 50.08 % penetration of world population. According to Statista, in 2019 there are 2.22 billion social media networking users worldwide, i.e., 31 % of global social media networking penetration and it is expected that in 2021 this number will reach 3.02 billion. These social networking sites are attracting users from all walks of life and keeping these users' data in the cloud. Today's big challenge is related to an increase in volume, velocity, variety and veracity of data in social media networking, and this leads to creating several concerns, including privacy and security; on the other hand, it also proves as a tool to prevent and investigate cybercrime, if intelligently and smartly handled. The law enforcement agencies are putting their utmost efforts to prevent cybercrime by monitoring communications activities over the Internet. In this paper, the authors discuss recommendations and techniques for preventing cybercrime."
For the past 10 years, Thailand has been one of the top 10 countries targeted by cyber criminals. In order to address this pressing issue of computer and cybercrime, Thailand enacted the Computer Crime Act (Version 2) of 2017 to better reflect the changing nature and types of computer crime and created the CyberCrime Investigation Bureau to be directly responsible for such crime. Very little empirical research has been conducted in Thailand on this topic. The data in this study are from in-depth interviews of 20 experts and two focus groups of 20 experts each. The data from the interviews and the first focus group focused on the obstacles facing computer crime officials in dealing with computer crime. The second focus group discussed and analyzed the findings and then offered recommendations for future police policies and practices. The recommendations address not only the main obstacles found in the five main areas of police policies (international cooperation, law enforcement officials, victims, technology, and legal aspects), but also offer proactive police practices to be considered, such as human rights violation precautions and police recruitment and career paths for computer crime personnel.
With the rapid development of social informatization, the Internet has become an important channel for global information dissemination. The wireless network space and the real space are intertwined and have a significant impact on the political, economic, and cultural aspects of international society. For example, it can effectively solve the problem of information exchange between cities, regions, and countries. Wireless network crime and wireless network space security issues involve the development of information technology in various countries and, more importantly, involve all aspects of national security. In the age of science and technology, the current situation of cybercrime can be expressed by data as follows: the online crime rate is high. According to relevant statistics, nearly 5 million Internet users are involved in various cases every year due to the use of the Internet. This article starts with the digital forensics of wireless network crime and wireless network security management systems and discusses the composition, characteristics, existing problems, and future development directions of the current wireless network security management system. By comparing the wireless network security laws of China and the United States, using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-Gibbs model and the k-means algorithm to analyze the data, this article provides guidance for future research on wireless network space governance. The combination of digital forensics analysis based on cybercrime and space governance can improve the level of public security work. At present, the world has made some progress in cyberspace, but it still faces severe challenges. In the face of new situations and new measures, it is necessary to strengthen legislation, improve relevant systems, and strengthen supervision capacity. At the same time, it is necessary to establish perfect technical means and safeguards to ensure that this goal can be achieved.
"Although older people rarely report being victims of financial cybercrime, there is evidence that older online users are at increased risk. This realist review identified factors leading to older adults' victimisation and reviewed the theory and evidence for interventions to reduce victimisation risks. We developed an initial programme theory from a scoping review and expert stakeholder consultations. We searched electronic databases, references and websites for literature meeting inclusion criteria. We analysed 52 primary and secondary data sources, seeking stakeholder views to develop and refine the programme theory and generate Context-Mechanism-Outcome Configurations (CMOCs) explaining how, why and in what circumstances older adults become financial cybercrime victims; and extrapolated this to consider rational intervention strategies. Our programme theory comprised 16 CMOCs describing how: social isolation, cognitive, physical and mental health problems; wealth status, limited cyber security skills or awareness, societal attitudes and content of scams led to victimisation. Our refined programme theory provides a novel framework to guide future intervention design. Only interventions to enhance older internet users' awareness and skills have been trialled to date. Other theoretically plausible interventions include: offender management programmes, tailored security measures, society-wide stigma reduction and awareness-raising with groups who support older people."
"Using a systematic review of literature, this study identifies the potential impact of blockchain solutions for augmenting supply chain resilience (SCR) to cybercrime. This rich literature synthesis forms the basis of a novel theoretical framework that provides guidance and insight for blockchain adopters and vendors as well as delineate palpable benefits of this novel technology. An interpretivist philosophical design and inductive reasoning are adopted to conduct the systematic review of literature. A total of 867 papers were retrieved from Scopus database between the years of 2016 and 2020 and subsequently analysed via abductive reasoning, grounded theory and a thematic meta-analysis; where the latter was achieved using a scientometric approach and software tools such as VOS viewer and NVivo. Scientometric analysis revealed the most prolific countries, sources, publications and authors who reside at the vanguard of blockchain developments and adoption. Subsequent grounded theory analysis identified six main clusters of research endeavour viz: case study, challenges and opportunity, traceability, smart contract blockchain and IoT and data security. From 28 SCR metrics identified within literature, five were found to have been positively impacted by blockchain technology solutions, namely: visibility, collaboration, integration, risk management and information sharing. Prominent applications of blockchain technology in practice were traceability systems and smart contracts which are often implemented separately or in combination and primarily in food supply chains. This research constitutes the first study to critically synthesise extant literature for evaluation of blockchain solutions' implication on SCR metrics. New perspectives obtained provided a basis for the novel theoretical framework for implementation that will be valued by software developers and adopting organizations, whilst creating new direction for researchers interested in blockchain technology."
In this explorative study we provide empirical insight into how organized crime offenders use IT to launder their money. Our empirical data consist of 30 large-scale criminal investigations into organized crime. These cases are part of the most recent, fifth data sweep of the Dutch Organized Crime Monitor (DOCM). We do not focus on cybercrime alone. Instead, we explore the financial aspects of criminal operations in a broad range of types of organized crime, i.e. from 'traditional' types of organized crime, such as offline drug smuggling, to cybercrime. Regarding the spending of criminal proceeds (consumption and investment), the analyses show several similarities and no major differences between traditional crime and cybercrime. When it comes to concealing criminal earnings (money laundering), we do see important differences. Financial innovation, such as the use of cryptocurrencies, seems to be limited to cases of IT-related crime. One of the most striking similarities between cybercrime and traditional crime is the offenders' preference for cash. In the analysed cases, malware and phishing offenders as well as online drug traffickers change their digital currencies for cash, at least in part.
"Cybercrime continues to be a detrimental problem in South Africa and continues to change in nature and sophistication. Innovations and technological advancements aimed at moving the world towards a digital age increase the risks of cybercrime. Concurrently, as the risk of cybercrime increases so does the challenge to police it. The policing of cybercrime is generally an afterthought for several organisations and individuals in South Africa. This type of crime has no regional, national or international boundaries, unlike ?traditional crime? which has physical boundaries and limits in relation to jurisdiction. This contributes towards the challenge of detecting, investigating and combating it. Cyber criminals have intercepted vital and essential government, personal and business information online. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the obstacles/challenges that hamper the effective and efficient policing of cybercrime in Durban, South Africa. A qualitative research approach was adopted, to explore the challenges of policing of cybercrime in the study area. The findings collected through semi-structured interviews with a total number of twenty (20) participants comprising of SAPS Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) officials, members of Bowline Security and members of the Durban community; suggest that there is a shortage of SAPS officials who are knowledgeable in handling cybercrime related cases. Policies and strategies to police cybercrime in Durban are insufficient because of the lack of resources, to adequately implement policy and promote cooperative strategic partnerships. Together, these findings suggest that all relevant stakeholder organisations should assist in minimising the challenge of policing of cybercrime."
Last decade can be characterized by the rapid integration of smart applications and digitization of all aspects of our life. Cheap, portable and easy to deploy hardware and software components lead to the integration of tiniest Internet of Things (IoT) components in almost every digital household product that is currently on the market. Bringing data processing to the Edge and moving operations into the Cloud, companies try to operationalize novel utilization of IoT. Given altruistic goals to improve quality of life, reduce the amount of manual labour and provide more sustainable technologies, such smart solutions became an increasingly attractive target for adversarial actors. Attack scenarios that were considered as highly unlikely 10 years ago have been implemented and demonstrated on several occasions, including Mirai botnet. Distributed computations, variety of legal standards, cross-border data sharing brings novel obstacles in cybercrime investigation. However, it does not mean that the data and pieces of digital evidence from the IoT ecosystem cannot improve the pro-active response of law enforcement agencies. This paper addresses issues and discusses opportunities of IoT technology to enhance public safety and security in the long run.
Intelligent software packages have become fast-growing in popularity for large businesses in both developed and developing countries, due to their higher availability in detecting and preventing cybercrime. However, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are showing prominent gaps in this adoption due to their level of awareness and knowledge towards cyber security and the security mindset. This is due to their priority of running their businesses over requiring using the right technology in protecting their data. This study explored how SMEs in Wales are handling cybercrime and managing their daily online activities the best they can, in keeping their data safe in tackling cyber threats. The sample collected consisted of 122 Welsh SME respondents in a collection of data through a survey questionnaire. The results and findings showed that there were large gaps in the awareness and knowledge of using intelligent software, in particular the uses of machine learning integration within their technology to track and combat complex cybercrime that perhaps would have been missed by standard cyber security software packages. The study's findings showed that only 30% of the sampled SMEs understood the terminology of cyber security. The awareness of machine learning and its algorithms was also questioned in the implementation of their cyber security software packages. The study further highlighted that Welsh SMEs were unaware of what this software could do to protect their data. The findings in this paper also showed that various elements such as education and the size of SME made an impact on their choices for the right software packages being implemented, compared to elements such as age, gender, role and being a decision maker, having no impact on these choices. The study finally shares the investigations of various SME strategies to help understand the risks, and to be able to plan for future contingencies and preparation in keeping data safe and secure for the future.
This article explores the social and market dynamics of Darkode, an invitation-only cybercrime forum that was dismantled by the FBI in July 2015 and was described by a U.S. Attorney as the most sophisticated English-speaking forum for criminal computer hackers in the world. Based on a leaked database of 4,788 discussion threads, we examine the selection process through which 344 potential new members introduced themselves to the community in order to be accepted into this exclusive group. Using a qualitative approach, we attempt to assess whether this rigorous procedure significantly enhanced the trust between traders, and therefore, contributed to the efficiency of this online illicit marketplace. We find that trust remained elusive and interactions were often fraught with suspicion and accusations. Even hackers who were considered successful faced significant challenges in trying to profit from the sale of malicious software and stolen data.
Cybercrimes are increasing in Malaysia. According to a report the crimes jumped by 88 per cent in 2011 with 15,218 cases compared with 8090 in 2010. This report has caused a lot of concern from the Government and the public. At a glance, these crimes are like 'diseases' spreading throughout the country and causing damage to people, the economy and the country. Although various efforts have been taken and some are still ongoing, total prevention of cybercrime is very difficult. Combating the threat is very challenging since Malaysia is still lacking in many of the tools required including manpower and technology. But the efforts will continue. This paper discusses some of the efforts taken by the Government and other organisations to deal with these problems followed by an analysis on the application of cyberlaws and how these measures work together with the traditional law in tackling cybercrime cases.

"Underground forums provide useful insights into cybercrime, where researchers analyse underlying economies, key actors, their discussions and interactions, as well as different types of cybercrime. This interdisciplinary topic of study incorporates expertise from diverse areas, including computer science, criminology, economics, psychology, and other social sciences. Historically, there were significant challenges around access to data, but there are now research datasets of millions of messages scraped from underground forums. The problems now stem from the size of these datasets and the technical nature of methods and tools available for data sampling and analysis at scale, which make data exploration difficult for non-technical users. POSTCoG has been developed to solve this problem. We first provide a survey of prior work into underground forums; this was used to understand the requirements and functionalities valued by researchers, and to inform the design of a data exploration tool. We then describe POSTCoG, a web application developed to support users from both technical and non-technical backgrounds in forum analyses, such as search, information extraction and cross-forum comparison. The prototype's usability is then evaluated through two user studies with expert users of the CRIMEBB dataset. POSTCoG is made available for academic research upon signing an agreement with the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre."
There are reports that criminal networks advertise on social media to recruit new members. In this paper, we will focus on money mules and examine how they become involved in cybercrime on Instagram. Money mules are used to hide the financial trail of a crime and are thus indispensable for cybercriminal networks. Yet, there is a dearth of research on this group. Based on keywords derived from the literature, 43 Dutch Instagram accounts were identified that are most likely used to recruit money mules. We analyzed the content of said accounts in order to map the recruitment techniques used by criminals online. Insights from previous literature on offline recruitment were used to provide an initial framework for the analysis. Thereafter, results were considered in the light of situational crime prevention. In this article, we will argue that while Instagram indeed offers possibilities for criminals to recruit money mules, different situational strategies can be applied to prevent this. This study underlines the relevance of social media in criminological research and encourages future studies to explore this innovative method further.
From online banking to social networking sites, the advent of the Internet has revolutionized the manner in which society carries out their online routine activities. Although the Internet continues to be an invaluable resource, it also provides a unique medium for offenders to engage in crime and delinquency. Although criminologists have begun to explore the application of traditional theories into virtual environments, less is known about trends in the application and growth of cybercrime at the macro-level. Expanding on the core elements of Cohen and Felson's seminal work, we hypothesize that increases in rates of cybercrime are the result of technological social changes occurring post-commercialization of the Internet. A variety of data are presented to substantiate our hypothesis, along with a discussion of an online household activity ratio that holds promise in explaining trends in financial cybercrime victimization.
Besides the many positive effects of the use of information technologies, it also generates many problems. It is especially of great importance to determine the level of knowledge and awareness of individuals on the cybercrime. No studies have been conducted on this issue in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Based on this, it was necessary to determine the knowledge level of adolescents who are frequent users of digital technologies regarding the cybercrimes and their attitudes toward them. This study is a descriptive survey model. The working group is composed of 407 adolescents in the TRNC. The data collection tool was Concepts of Informatics and Student Opinion Survey on Cyber Crimes developed by Gozler and Tasci (2015). The 5 point Likert scale questionnaire consists of 16 items. Frequency, percentage and mean analysis was applied during the data analysis. It is clear that cybercrime awareness in Northern Cyprus has to be increased.
In this continuously moving and progressing word of technology the need of cyber security is increased interchangeably. The role of every individual is very important in securing cyber former consider to this as an additional dimension and also focus person has a potential target. By considering this, the discussion on cyber security become important and it has important implication because it focusses on the ethical part of society. It's not easy to deal with this issue as it addresses wide range of problems from cybercrime to online harassment to online frauds to overcome this issue several frameworks are introduced. In this paper we will review the techniques to deal with cyber issues, the areas where cybercrime are happening repeatedly, cybercrime as a global and national issue, sectors affected by cybercrime by studding this we will come to know that what are the challenges the society and corporate sector are facing related to cyber security along with the economy and politics. After knowing the challenges only, we can find out its solution, this problem as a whole has covered a large area so that we do have much scope to do research over it. Here we will review and analyze the limitation, challenges, techniques of securing cyber word.
The unfamiliarity of their surroundings and dependence on internet connections make international travellers particularly vulnerable to cybercrime. Travel medicine clinicians should be aware of the cybersecurity threats facing travellers and be able to recognize particularly vulnerable travellers. This article outlines these threats and provides advice to mitigate them.
While technological innovations over the last thirty years have markedly improved the ways in which people communicate and gather information, these advances have also led to computer crimes and related deviance becoming permanent fixtures in our society. In an effort to curtail internet offending, it is important for academics and practitioners alike to better understand why some individuals engage in cybercriminality. Criminologists have utilized several theories to investigate this type of deviance, including low self-control theory. However, the vast majority of this prior research has focused on a narrow scope of offending, namely digital piracy. The current study utilizes a sample of 488 undergraduate students to evaluate the theory's generality hypothesis by examining the extent to which low self-control predicts online deviance in general and beyond digital piracy more specifically. Study results support the generality hypothesis in that low self-control is related to non-digital piracy online deviance. Specific findings, policy implications, and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
The increasing number of online transactions and other internet activities give rise to the proliferation of online scam. The Philippine National Police - Anti Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) reported an increasing number of complaints from a double digit figure in 2013 to a triple digit figure in 2017. The challenge of addressing this problem in the Philippines is shared by other developing countries in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. Since 2013 when the PNP-ACG was established, cybercrime data continue to be accumulated but were not given much attention and significance in research. Previous studies highlight the importance of taking advantage of data mining. However, the absence of empirical studies on cybercrime analytics in the country connotes the lack of exploitation of data mining in facilitating cybercrime investigations. This study exploits Weka text mining tool in order to draw insights by classifying a given online scam dataset. Online scam unstructured data were considered as dataset containing a total of 14,098 mainly Filipino words. J48 Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Sequential Minimal Optimization were used to build classification models. All these three classifiers or algorithms were compared in terms of performance and prediction accuracy. The results show that J48 achieves the highest accuracy and the lowest error rate, followed by Naive Bayes and then the SMO classifier. Also, the responses during validation reveal that J48 is preferred over the other classifiers as it easy to understand and apply in cybercrime investigations. This demonstrates how text mining can assist the PNP-ACG in analyzing online scam criminal data as it also highlights the importance of employing data mining tools in the legal and criminal investigation domains in the Philippines. Further work can be carried out in the future using different and a more inclusive cybercrime datasets and other classification techniques in Weka or any other data mining tool, and other data mining tasks such as crime prevention and prediction, clustering, finding leads, trends and patterns of criminal activities, among others.
The evolution of mobile cellular communication has been growing rapidly from 1G to 4G. Unfortunately, with this technology comes an increasing risk of cellular cybercrime. This research proposed a novel methodology to reveal the cybercrime adversary's location by using radio cellular forensics. Several tests were conducted to validate the proposed methodology. This research also presented the digital evidence in a forensically sound manner to support the forensics investigators. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed methodology can be used as a reference for investigators, analysts, and police in cybercrime cases.
The purpose of the article is to study the legal regulation of cybersecurity in the context of digital transformation in modern Ukrainian society. To achieve this goal, the author uses the scientific methods of analysis, abstraction, synthesis, and content analysis, which made it possible to study the relevant scientific literature and determine the views of scholars on the problems of cybercrime and counteraction to it. The results show that the legal framework lags behind modern methods of cybercrime. Changes in legislation, including Ukrainian legislation, are sometimes partial, which does not help to solve the problem. A separate problem is the negative reaction of civil society to the introduction of additional restrictions on the functioning of the digital sphere in general. At the same time, the Ukrainian legal system already needs to be guided by European standards of cybersecurity, which would confirm the country's European integration aspirations. However, even this does not allow formulating a universal legal framework for combating cybercrime, as countering cybercrime with the use of state institutions, as in the example of the Kremlin regime's current policy, requires careful analysis due to the emergence of new challenges for law enforcement systems.
The primary purpose of this study was to examine the demographics and risk and needs associated with cyber-dependent offenders serving a term of community supervision in order to understand how they might be supervised most effectively. This study examined the risk and needs assessment results for 813 cyber-dependent offenders supervised by federal probation in the United States. Descriptive statistics were used to provide a portrait of the demographics and review their risk and needs scores. The analysis uncovered that cybercrime offenders on federal supervision were more often white, male, and 38.2 years old on average. In regards to risk and needs assessment, most cybercrime offenders scored as low risk to reoffend suggesting they require minimal supervision and services. Because most cybercrime offenders were low risk, they had few criminogenic needs yet the types of needs they had suggest this population might require different services than probation typically provides for offenders. This study addresses a neglected topic in the correctional rehabilitation literature and offers insight into a cybercrime subject with limited official data.
The objective of this study is to establish that individuals associated with diplomatic missions, such as diplomats and administrators, are not exempt from the jurisdiction of their home country's legal system. Therefore, the legal system of their home country can hold individuals occupying diplomatic positions accountable for any errors ascribed to them, in accordance with the stipulations delineated in the Civil Service Law and pertinent administrative rules. This accountability persists even if they are not subject to the laws of the host country, in accordance with the recognised rules of diplomatic judicial immunity. This study additionally investigates the difficulties and consequences of cybercrime, particularly in the setting of diplomatic missions. In order to accomplish this goal, the current study has utilised a methodological framework based on the discipline of jurisprudence. This entailed collecting data from several primary and secondary sources. The study utilised a blend of descriptive and comparative analytical approaches to investigate the legislation of many Arab countries and the French legal system. The study's conclusions suggest that national laws establish committees and bodies with explicit responsibilities for overseeing, disciplining, and enforcing sanctions. These procedures function based on the principle of gradualism, which regulates the legislative structure for administrative responsibility in diplomatic and consular missions. Competent authorities must abstain from any actions that could be interpreted as an abuse of power or a deviation from established protocols. Concurrently, we carefully attended to the unique attributes of these works in the field of diplomatic service. Moreover, it is important to mention that the host countries have the power to start legal actions against diplomatic agents in situations related to cybercrime, following their own domestic laws. The study concluded by defining the administrative tasks carried out by diplomatic missions, which are within the jurisdiction of the administrative judiciary. This control is established to ensure the efficient implementation of administrative activities and obligations within the host nation. This paper proposes several recommendations, emphasising the significance of promptly bestowing authority upon the administrative judiciary to attain beneficial outcomes.
This paper examines the impact of cybercrime and hacking events on equity market volatility across publicly traded corporations. The volatility influence of these cybercrime events is shown to be dependent on the number of clients exposed across all sectors and the type of the cyber security breach event, with significantly large volatility effects presented for companies who find themselves exposed to cybercrime in the form of hacking. Evidence is presented to suggest that corporations with large data breaches are punished substantially in the form of stock market volatility and significantly reduced abnormal stock returns. Companies with lower levels of market capitalisation are found to be most susceptible. In an environment where corporate data protection should be paramount, minor breaches appear to be relatively unpunished by the stock market. We also show that there is a growing importance in the contagion channel from cybersecurity breaches to markets volatility. Systematic weakness in the existent mechanisms for cybersecurity oversight and enforcement could be improved through the ring-fenced incentivisation of both current and ex-hackers. Their expertise is central to the identification of weak corporate cybersecurity practices.
There is a growing interest in using mathematical models to understand crime dynamics, crime prevention, and detection. The past decade has experienced a relative reduction in conventional crimes, but this has been replaced by significant increases in cybercrime. In this paper, we use deterministic modelling to describe the spread of cybercrime across a cyber-network by describing the heterogeneity of interactions between individuals using a nonlinear interaction between individuals in the network, and we allow criminals to operate either internally or externally to the cyber-network. We are able to determine the impact of the location of the criminal relative to the cyber-network which is being attacked. The model structure incorporates key elements of a social network structure thereby allowing for limited rates of victimisation. Both model structure and our observations are novel and provide a new contribution to the theoretical discussion of cybercrime dynamics, offering potential avenues to consider control strategies. Using steady-state analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we find that the location of criminals relative to the network does not impact the system qualitatively, although there are quantitative differences. Cyber-networks that are more clustered are likely to experience greater levels of cybercrime, but there is also a saturation effect that limits the level of victimisation as the number of criminals attempting to undertake crimes on given network increases. We discuss model limitations and describe how the model might be used with datasets to translate the theoretical findings into a useful tool in the fight to detect and eradicate cybercrime activity.
In today's fast changing world, cybercrimes are growing at perturbing pace. At the very definition of it, cybercrimes get engendered by capitalizing on threats and exploitation of vulnerabilities. However, recent history reveals that such crimes often come with surprises and seldom follow the trends. This puts the defense systems behind in the race, because of their inability to identify new patters of cybercrime and to ameliorate to the required levels of security. This paper visualizes the empowerment of security systems through real-time data mining by the virtue of which these systems will be able to dynamically identify patterns of cybercrimes. This will help those security systems stepping up their defense capabilities, while adapting to the required levels posed by newly germinating patterns. In order to confine within scope of this paper, the application of this approach is being discussed in the context of selected scenarios ofcybercrime.
Unlike traditional crime, cyberspace crimes are relatively new and constantly changing and law enforcement practices have not kept pace with the sophistication of emerging cybercrime. To fulfil their public safety mission of effectively addressing criminal activity, police as cyber investigators, need to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and capabilities to effectively manage a cybercrime investigation. To be successful in this area, criminal justice practitioners must be trained and educated to a level of competency to effectively respond, process, and present legally sufficient evidence for proving a cybercrime beyond a reasonable doubt. This study examined multiple sources of agency reports on cybercrime and cyber investigations to describe the growing cybercrime threat and discuss the contemporary challenges of cybercrime investigations created by the convergence of operational and jurisdictional demands.
The manosphere is a constellation of masculinist social media communities loosely unified by an anti-feminist worldview. Although extant journalism and social media scholarship successfully delineate the manosphere as a significant social problem by associating it with misogynist cybercrime and cyberhate, the resulting narrative simplistically pathologizes manosphere discourse while leaving its misogyny undertheorized. In this article, I complicate this emerging narrative by demonstrating how a certain central manosphere discourse qualitatively overlaps with a broader neoliberal ideology. I do so by further developing a critical discourse analysis of quasi-representative manosphere documents drawn from The Red Pill, a sub-forum of Reddit.com. Although this forum is explicitly devoted to discussing heterosexual seduction strategies, I find that it also produces a discursive means for fiscally conservative men to reconcile their pro-capitalist economic beliefs with apparent evidence of capitalism's destructive tendencies and contradictions. This forum's anti-feminist discourse implicitly parallels Marxian theory while explicitly supporting free market capitalism and denigrating women, thereby providing men with a linguistic and conceptual framework to scapegoat women for economic problems while leaving neoliberal ideas and assumptions unchallenged.
The TENSOR and SAINT projects, funded under the European Commision's financial instrument Horizon 2020, are developing cutting edge technologies and technical tools to fight serious and organised crime on the web. These projects are examined as a showcase to highlight the fact that technological advancements do not always adhere to Legal and Ethical Requirements. Compliance with a complex framework, consisting of European Union Regulations, Directives, National Laws, International Regulations and policies is mandatory for all cybercrime fighting solutions. The necessity of a harmonized regulatory framework for Law Enforcement Agencies across all member states is emphasized, especially in cases of cross-border cooperation. Current operational procedures of European cyber security practitioners are examined for similarities, legal adherence and effectiveness to suppress evolving cybercrime.
Cybercrime is considered an issue of both local and global concern. Therefore, this study focuses on the local experience in cybercrime control of different countries, including the Republic of Turkey. The article discusses issues in cybersecurity policy and analyzes the legislative framework of the Republic of Turkey on cybercrime issues. The findings underlie the continuing education policy for cybersecurity employees. The study concludes that Turkey handles the current cybercrime situation with efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent times, the number of cybercrimes against cloud systems and services is rapidly growing. Although, there are numerous protection systems such as firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention system, and anti-viruses that are developed to protect cloud infrastructures and services from severe attacks, but still the risk of criminal activities exists. This lead to attract the attention of researchers and scientists around the world to digital forensic which is a science to aid law enforcement officers and digital investigator to identify, collect and analyze digital footprints or evidence which are collected from a crime scene. One of the significant sources of as a digital evidence in the cloud is log data because they frequently connect events in certain time. The process of log data forensics mitigates the investigation process by identifying the malicious behavior and reveal the hidden malicious activities. Cloud log analysis can help to reconstruct cybercrime events which occurred in the cloud. Traditional log data analysis procedures and tools can be adapted to cloud through using new fast on memory computing platforms such as Apache Spark. Spark is a general-purpose cluster-computing engine, which is very fast and reliable. This paper presents analysis approach for batch and stream log data using Apache Spark. The results show that Spark can be used as a fast platform for handling the diverse large size of log data and extract useful information that can assist digital investigators in the analysis immense amount of generated cloud log data in a given frame of time. Furthermore, the results can make provision to reconstruct and generate a timeline related to historical past sequence events occurred during a cloud crime as well as identify the malicious user's IP address, date and time, with a number of accesses.
Chapter Four delves deeply into human actors involved in underground cyber markets in order to better understand how they function and what social dynamics shape the behavior of users. In particular, this chapter focuses on markets where individuals sell cybercrime as a service, including malware, hacking services, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and personal data. Through describing the structure and social ecosystem, the chapter provides insight into how actors deceive one another in order to gain competitive or economic advantage. Later, the chapter discusses trust dynamics and subcultural norms within underground cybercrime markets, particularly within the context of transactions. The chapter concludes by examining salient intercultural deception techniques among underground market interactants, such as virtual false flags, sock puppets, persuasive technology, and impersonation.
"This work addresses fundamental questions about the nature of cybercriminal organization. We investigate the organization of three underground forums: Blackhat World, Carders and L33tCrew to understand the nature of distinct communities within a forum, the structure of organization and the impact of enforcement, in particular banning members, on the structure of these forums. We find that each forum is divided into separate competing communities. Smaller communities are limited to 100-230 members, have a two-tiered hierarchy akin to a gang, and focus on a subset of cybercrime activities. Larger communities may have thousands of members and a complex organization with a distributed multi-tiered hierarchy more akin to a mob; such communities also have a more diverse cybercrime portfolio compared to smaller cohorts. Finally, despite differences in size and cybercrime portfolios, members on a single forum have similar operational practices, for example, they use the same electronic currency."
Economic forms of cybercrime affect millions of people around the world. Preparatory crimes such as spam, scam and malware are increasingly enacted by cybercriminals. However, literature has shown that some people are more vulnerable than others to these types of attacks and this may be a circumstance that varies cross-nationally. Using a comparative research design, behaviors that are associated with a higher probability of victimization by economic preparatory crimes are identified. The results obtained from two samples, one Spanish and one Australian, show that despite similar victimization prevalence, the correlates of routine activities vary substantially. While 6 of the 11 behaviors analyzed were similar, other substantial differences were found. The greatest risk for Spanish participants is online shopping, while for Australians it is downloading files. Differences were also found for use of antivirus, pirated software, contacting strangers and taking part in video conferences. Based on the current research, it is concluded that cyber victimization should focus on identifying nuances in the daily activities performed by online users, rather than on broader constructs such as interaction or visibility. Further, preventive strategies must take into account differences in routine behaviors across different geographical areas.
The current capabilities of many law enforcement agencies are tightly constrained despite the heightened level of awareness and concern for the role recent technology has in facilitating cybercrime and instances of online victimization. More specialized computer forensics and digital evidence training programs are necessary to meet the needs of local and state law enforcement agencies. Based on the context, this paper discusses an interdisciplinary approach to addressing this dilemma while providing in-depth computer forensics and cybercrime investigation training that is both informative and pragmatic to future law enforcement officers. Using pre- and post-test results, this study assesses students' technical background levels, reflecting comprehensive course learning objectives and pre-training levels of applied digital forensic investigation knowledge. Results suggest that students' technical abilities and knowledge of different investigative tools significantly improved after the program. In particular, the program not only strengthened students' knowledge of digital forensic investigation, but also helped students achieve higher t-test scores. We expect our study results to provide recommendations for cyber programs in other higher education institutions. The findings will serve as a guide for enhancing the current capacities of other higher education institutions to better serve their students in areas of computer forensics and digital evidence. In the long term, these efforts will lead to more effective cybercrime investigation and successful prosecutions, ultimately reducing cybercrime victimization.
This paper investigates the financial market effects of recent cybercriminality in cryptocurrency markets. Hacking events are found to increase both the price volatility of the targeted cryptocurrency and broad cross-cryptocurrency correlations. Further, cybercrime events significantly reduce price discovery sourced within the hacked currency relative to other cryptocurrencies. Finally, abnormal returns in the hours prior to the cybercrime event, revert to zero when news is publicly announced. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Cybercrime has been regarded understandably as a consequent compromise that follows the advent and perceived success of the computer and internet technologies. Equally effecting the privacy, trust, finance and welfare of the wealthy and low-income individuals and organizations, this menace has shown no indication of slowing down. Reports across the world have consistently shown exponential increase in the numbers and costs of cyber-incidents, and more worriedly low conviction rates of cybercriminals, over the years. Stakeholders increasingly explore ways to keep up with containing cyber-incidents by devising tools and techniques to increase the overall efficiency of investigations, but the gap keeps getting wider. However, criminal profiling-an investigative technique that has been proven to provide accurate and valuable directions to traditional crime investigations-has not seen a widespread application, including a formal methodology, to cybercrime investigations due to difficulties in its seamless transference. This paper, in a bid to address this problem, seeks to preliminarily identify the exact benefits criminal profiling has brought to successful traditional crime investigations and the benefits it can translate to cybercrime investigations, identify the challenges posed by the cyber-scene to its implementation in cybercrime investigations, and proffer a practicable solution.
"Firms that aim to acquire a competitive advantage over their closest rivals frequently engage in anti-competitive and unfair commercial activities. Multiple firms rely on competition laws to safeguard their customers legally. The business competition legislation helps enterprises/SMEs build their market and business strategies more efficiently; nevertheless, not all firms implement an in-house compliance program that could benefit from the competition law. They are uninformed of the prerequisite tactics and practices that can contribute to competitive advantage and long-term viability. This article aimed to explore the scope and aims of Indonesia's competition strategy in light of the country's expanding trade and investment regime (Lloyd, 2000). The study evaluated the Indonesian competition laws and regulations in the context of a normative competition law theory framework and the execution of competition law provisions. Cases assessed by the Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) were also mentioned as evidence of alleged competition law violations. The study employed a documentation survey and exploratory research methodology to determine the applicable national, and international business competition laws and the underlying regulations companies must adhere to in terms of labor and wages, competition, trade tariffs, health and safety, the environment, and data protection. The research will have a positive social influence on the working relationships between SMEs and their stakeholders. The Commerce Competition Supervisory Commission's restricted authority may impact Indonesia's antitrust laws, especially those about the online industry (buying and selling). This article discusses and analyzes the competition laws in effect in Indonesia to safeguard consumer and societal interests."
The global Coronavirus pandemic has not only a social impact, by causing infections and deaths, but it has also shaped the economy at a global scale, having the potential to close entire cities or regions by installing quarantine, bankrupt small or unsustainable business, rise to commercial shortage certain industries, while causing a dramatic fall for others. The current paper illustrates how the coronavirus pandemic influenced different sectors causing the transition of certain activities to the virtual space. Cyberspace is not immune to these fast changes: public and private organization are now being forced to implement remote working solution for their employee. In this sense, the internet usage has increased exponentially. Thus, understanding the impact of the online transition and analysing the potential threats and their causes, is a crucial task for organisations in order to not be vulnerable to cyberattacks. As more and more users, with no basic knowledge in cyberdefence, are using public networks to pass sensitive information, cybersecurity has become more important than ever. Therefore, the current research outlines a set of cyber due diligence and cyber due care strategies that represent good practices for organisations in the context of crises.
Cybercriminals increasingly use sophisticated tools and advanced methods to attack bank systems. Cyber black markets for hacking tools or services are gaining widespread attention as more advanced persistent threat attacks are relevant to such markets. The recent cyber-attacks on banks or financial institutions have increased the technical expertise of cybercriminals. This study reviews ATM threats and highlights the cybercrime investigation of ATM heist. An incident investigation strategy from ISO/IEC 27043:2015 is proposed to embed cyber-attack phases and detect ATM heist. It demonstrates how this strategy can provide investigators with exceptional abilities to interpret evidence. By integrating an effective cybercrime investigation strategy, investigators can minimize the cost of collecting evidence in a forensically sound manner.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most secure platform for making human existence easier and more comfortable. IoT has made a big contribution to a variety of software programs. The rapid proliferation of smart devices, as well as their trust in data transfer and the use of Wi-Fi mechanics, has increased their vulnerability to cyber-attacks. As a result, the cost of cybercrime is rising every day. As a result, investigating IoT security threats and possible countermeasures can assist researchers in creating acceptable ways to deal with a variety of stressful scenarios in cybercrime research. The IoT framework, as well as IoT architecture, protocols, and technology, are all covered in this assessment research. Various protection issues at each tier, as well as correction strategies, are also detailed. In addition, this article discusses the use of IoT forensics in cybercrime investigations in a variety of areas, including cybercrime research, Artificial intelligence, system learning, cloud computing, fog computing, and blockchain technology all play a role in this discussion. Finally, some open research on challenging situations in IoT is detailed to enhance cybercrime investigations, providing a cutting-edge course for future research.
Research SummaryThis study utilized a quantitative analysis of 246 cyberattack incidents reported in the Extremist CyberCrime Database to identify significant predictors of nation-state-sponsored cyberattacks relative to those performed by non-nation-state-sponsored ideological actors. Clarke and Newman's Situational Crime Prevention framework for terrorism was used to identify differential opportunities to successfully affect targets on the basis of tools, weapons, and the ability to access targets in online settings. The analysis noted nation-state-sponsored attacks were less likely to use high-visibility attack methods and more likely to utilize attack methods leading to data breaches. In addition, they were more likely to target state governments and military entities relative to ideological actors.Policy ImplicationsNation-state attacks are more difficult to identify or mitigate while in process, requiring a more robust national cybersecurity policy framework to be implemented that moves beyond current practices. There is a need to better utilize all aspects of government, from legislation to grant funding, in order to deter cyberattacks from continuing into the future.
The exponential development in online social media allows users around the globe the possibility to share and communicate information and ideas freely in different formats of data via internet. This emerging media has become a dominant communication tool and it has been used as a communication channel in several events, especially The Arab Spring and BOSTON'S attack etc. In order to develop useful profiles of different cybercriminals, text mining techniques is an effective way to detect and predict criminal activities in microblog posts taking account the problems of data sparseness and semantic gap. The hashtags used on Twitter (e.g., #arabspring, #BostonAttack) contains outstanding indicators to detect events and trending topics especially to target and detect suspicious topics and eventual illegal events. Similarity approach is used in text analysis to detect suspicious posts in microblog publications. The evaluation of our proposed approach is done within real posts.
This PhD. Student works on researching nature and typification of cybercrime, how it affects the infrastructures that provide services to citizens. Strategic infrastructures are object of study. In addition, of these, the so-called critical infrastructures. The relationship between critical infrastructures with Smart Cities and these both with Smart G rids to achieve the goals in the best efficient way of governance. This doctoral thesis, also studies the reaction of the states to protect themselves from cybercrime and these infrastructures.
The ubiquity of cyber-incidents across individual and organizational realms suggests the inability of stakeholders to contain its pervasiveness. Reports across law enforcement, industry, and academia have corroborated this suggestion, with estimations of more explosive figures in the next couple of years. Insufficient investigative techniques, amongst others, have been identified as the stumbling block to effectively containing cybercrimes. Criminal profiling has recently been suggested by researchers as an investigative technique that could bring the immense value it has rendered in traditional crime investigations to cybercrime investigations. However, there have been a lot of difficulties encountered in the bid to apply this technique to cybercrime investigations, and researchers generally prefer to use more straightforward techniques. This paper seeks to highlight the technicalities of cybercrime that make the application of criminal profiling to its investigations such a difficult and dreadful undertaking. Recommendations are also provided about a probable solution to encourage more activity in this wanting area.
This exploratory study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social isolation and potential cybersecurity risks of Alzheimer's and other dementia caregivers. Through interviews and focus groups with caregivers, we examined the isolation and risks of Alzheimer's caregivers relative to their caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic in Virginia. The results illustrated the general isolation, frustration and vulnerability of dementia caregivers - frustration with and vulnerability to the virus, lack of resources and supports, and to cybercrime. Most caregivers expressed frustration with losing supports and services during the pandemic, not knowing what services were available or how to access them, and wanting virtual supports on their terms (e.g. where and when they needed them, how often, etc.). Virtual supports that did not meet their needs also increased their vulnerability to stress and isolation. While many caregivers understood their risks for cybercrime, they perceived themselves as lacking some technological knowledge needed to remain safe thus adding to stress and caregiving burden. The results show the need for training/education and general information about how to protect those who may be caring for others from cybercrime. Screening tools to identify those at risk for cybercrime would also be useful.
"Repeat victimization has been widely studied from the perspective of environmental criminology for several decades. During this period, criminologists have identified a set of repeat victimization premises that are observed for many crimes; however, it is unknown whether these premises are also valid for cybercrime. In this study we rely on more than 9 million Zone-H data records from 2010 to 2017 to test whether these premises apply for the cybercrime of website defacement. We show that the phenomenon of repeat victimization is also observed in defaced cyber places (i.e. websites). In particular, we found that repeats contributed little to crime rates, that repeats occurred even several years after the original incident, that they were committed disproportionately by prolific offenders, and that few offenders returned to victimize previous targets. The results suggest that some traditional premises of repeat victimization may also be valid for understanding cybercrime events such as website defacement, implying that environmental criminology theories also constitute a useful framework for cybercrime analysis. The implications of these results in terms of criminological theory, cybercrime prevention, and the limitations derived from the use of Zone-H data are discussed."
With the advancement of technology and smartphones, most of the transactions are performed online. This increased dependence on online transactions has resulted in the perpetration of cyber-crime. Any crime committed using electronic gadgets can be termed as Cybercrime. Cybercrime revenues are estimated at 1.5 trillion dollars for the year 2018. Lack of awareness in Cybercrime vigilance and reporting leads to many such crimes going unreported. This paper gives an insight into types of Cybercrime and reporting mechanism. A model has been proposed which would remove the bottlenecks of existing mechanism and lead to effective cyber-crime investigation. The paper would be of immense help to the stakeholders such as online users, investigative agencies and cyber-crime researchers.
In this paper, the decision-making processes of victims during ransomware attacks were analysed. Fortyone ransomware attacks using qualitative data collected from organisations and police officers from cybercrime units in the UK were examined. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that victims carefully analyse the situation before deciding whether to pay a ransom. This research confirms that victims often weigh the costs and benefits of interventions before making final decisions, and that their decisions are based on a range of reasons. As ransomware attacks become more prevalent globally, the findings should be highly relevant to those developing guidance and policies to prevent or minimise ransom payments.

Uncovering attacks on data and computer systems and those responsible for them is one of the contemporary problems that the authorities involved in criminal proceedings have to deal with. Where this sort of cybercrime is concerned we can expect not only high levels of latency but also a low clearup rate for crimes on file. This paper demonstrates this using the example of the Czech Republic, by providing an analysis of all cases of this type of cybercrime dealt with by courts between 2008 and 2016. It focuses in particular on proceedings concerned with illegal access and data and system interference. The cybercrimes that are brought to court in the Czech Republic is not representative of the cybercrime committed in the Czech Republic either in terms of its type or its extent. The cases dealt with by the courts are primarily connected with personal relationships and the Internet. The most frequent type of case thus concerns the misuse of passwords for accessing social networking sites or e-mail inboxes. We were also surprised to find that the courts had begun to apply facts relevant to cybercrime cases in cases involving the manual manipulation of gambling machines. The Czech Republic has evidently not yet found a way of demonstrating criminals' guilt in more complex cybercrime cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"This paper provides the first exploration of the online distribution of fake Australian COVID-19 vaccine certificates. Drawing on a collection of 2589 posts between five distributors and their community members on the alt-tech platform Gab, this study gathers key insights into the mechanics of illicit vaccine certificate distribution. The qualitative findings in this research demonstrate the various motivations and binding ideologies that underpinned this illicit distribution (e.g. anti-vaccine and anti-surveillance motivations); the unique cybercultural aspects of this online illicit network (e.g. 'crowdsourcing' the creation of fake vaccine passes); and how the online community was used to share information on the risks of engaging in this illicit service, setting the appropriate contexts of using fake vaccine passes, and the evasion of guardians in offline settings. Implications for future research in cybercrime, illicit networks, and organised crime in digital spaces are discussed."
Up-to-date studies and surveys regarding IT security show, that companies of every size and branch nowadays are faced with the growing risk of cybercrime. Many tools, standards and best practices are in place to support enterprise IT security experts in dealing with the upcoming risks, whereas meanwhile especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) feel helpless struggling with the growing threats. This article describes an approach, how SMEs can attain high quality assurance whether they are a victim of cybercrime, what kind of damage resulted from a certain attack and in what way remediation can be done. The focus on all steps of the analysis lies in the economic feasibility and the typical environment of SMEs.
Money mules play an essential role in the execution of financially-motivated cybercrimes. The bank accounts of money mules, who are often young individuals, are used to hide and launder stolen money, allowing members of cybercriminal networks to maintain their anonymity. In order to better understand the pathways that lead to cybercrime, this explorative study aims to map the experiences and perceptions of Dutch young people related to money muling. To this end, an online survey was administered among more than 3,000 individuals, aged between 16 and 25. Our analysis showed that almost ten percent of the respondents have been approached by money mule recruiters at some point. Most were contacted online via social media platforms, such as Snapchat and Instagram, but also offline, by their peers at school or by acquaintances or friends. Less than one percent of the respondents confessed to have actually been a money mule. The respondents' awareness about the risks connected to money muling was rather low and they seemed to underestimate the consequences of being a money mule, which makes them vulnerable to recruiters. Some young people also find it normal to be approached by recruiters and acceptable for others to use their bank accounts.
In our highly digitalized society, cybercrime has become a common crime. However, because research into cybercriminals is in its infancy, our knowledge about cybercriminals is still limited. One of the main considerations is whether cybercriminals have higher intellectual capabilities than traditional criminals or even the general population. Although criminological studies clearly show that traditional criminals have lower intellectual capabilities, little is known about the relationship between cybercrime and intelligence. The current study adds to the literature by exploring the relationship between CITO-test scores and cybercrime in the Netherlands. The CITO final test is a standardized test for primary school students - usually taken at the age of 11 or 12 - and highly correlated with IQ-scores. Data from Statistics Netherlands were used to compare CITO-test scores of 143 apprehended cybercriminals with those of 143 apprehended traditional criminals and 143 non-criminals, matched on age, sex, and country of birth. Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses were used to compare CITO test scores between cybercriminals, traditional criminals, and non-criminals. Additionally, a discordant sibling design was used to control for unmeasured confounding by family factors. Findings reveal that cybercriminals have significantly higher CITO test scores compared to traditional criminals and significantly lower CITO test scores compared to non-criminals.
Cybercrimes can result in very significant and far reaching adverse effects. As threats evolve continuously and perpetrators become increasingly sophisticated, fighting cybercrime is a growing challenge for stakeholders. Legal measures play an essential role in the fight against cybercrime. In the first part of this paper, we look into categories of cybercrime and outline the security attributes associated with computer systems. The second part of the paper discusses the Romanian criminal law measures aimed at preventing and combating cybercrime. We conclude this paper with recommendations.
Computer crimes and digital investigations comprise a substantial part of criminal policy, law and practice as information becomes the cornerstone of global economy. Innovative ways of attacking, exploiting and interfering with computer and communication technologies are regularly emerging, posing increasing threats to the society, economy and security. It is essential that in tackling cybercrime the right legal framework of offences is in place and that there is clarity in how the powers that are used to investigate cybercrime interact with the offences designed to catch cyber criminals. This paper reviews the current legal framework to cyber dependent crimes in the UK, including its recent amendments, and highlights areas that remain problematic and in need of attention from policymakers.
"Phishing, the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity via electronic communication, has quickly evolved beyond low-skill schemes that relied on casting a wide net. Spear phishing attacks target a particular high-value individual utilizing sophisticated techniques. This study aims to describe the current state of phishing, the expected technological advances and developments of the near future, and the best prevention and enforcement strategies. Data comes from interviews with approximately 60 information technology security professionals, hackers, and academic researchers. Routine Activity Theory provided an operational framework; while it is an imperfect fit for most crimes, it provides enough explanatory power for cyber-crimes. Interviewees mainly agreed: First, technological advances increase the proliferation of phishing attacks, but also aid in their detection. It has never been easier to conduct a simple attack, but a good attack requires more effort than ever before. Second, phishing is directly responsible financial fraud and, indirectly, as the primary attack vector for ransomware. Third, newer types of attacks utilizing technology, like deepfakes, will make the problem worse in the short-term. Fourth, prevention will come from machine learning and public education akin to WIFI security improvement via the combination of encryption and password awareness."
"Cryptoviruses are the one of the most important threats to cybersecurity nowadays. Cryptoviruses penetrate into computer systems through vulnerabilities and encrypt important files using symmetric key-based encryption algorithms with variable key length (Rijndael and Blowfish). Global cryptoviral attacks began last year: WannaCry in May, NotPetya in June; BadRabbit in October (Kaspersky Lab, 2017). Viruses spread automatically and forced information owners to pay a fee for the description. Mentioned viruses were created on the basis of the virus developments of the US National Security Agency (EternalBlue, DoublePulsar), stolen by the hacker group TheShadowBrokers. Counteraction to such global cybercrimes is possible only with joint efforts of most countries. The unification of criminal legislation on cybercrime of all participating countries including the criminal codes of Russia and Slovenia is required. At the present time, such cybercrime as cryptovirus extortion is not found in the legislation or in the law enforcement practice of most countries."
Botnets currently pose the most serious threat to the digital ecosystem, providing an infrastructure that enables bank fraud, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), and click fraud. During the past few years, three main approaches have been used to fight botnets. First, police organizations have periodically arrested prominent hackers and scammers, hoping such high-profile operations would have a deterrent effect. Second, Microsoft has performed a number of takedowns, using an innovative blend of legal and technical means that attempt to disrupt botnet operations and reduce their profitability. Third, some countries - Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany - encourage harm reduction strategies that rely on public-private partnerships involving internet service providers, anti-virus companies, and regulatory authorities. This article describes these three approaches (incapacitation, disruption, and harm reduction), the challenges they face, and their respective effectiveness in protecting the digital ecosystem from large-scale online harm.
A recent emerging trend in the underground economy is malware dissemination as a service. Complex botnet infrastructures are developed to spread and install malware for third-party customers. In this research work, a botnet forensic investigation model is proposed to investigate and analyze large-scale botnets. The proposed investigation model is applied to a real-world law-enforcement investigation case that involves investigation of a large-scale malware dissemination botnet called BredoLab. The results of the forensic investigation show the effectiveness of the proposed model in assisting law-enforcement to conduct a successful forensic analysis of BredoLab botnet and its related resources.
The Internet has become an increasingly attractive location for collecting data about cyber threats, driven by the abundance of quality data available and accessible online. As such, researchers and practitioners have turned to automated data collection technologies (ADCT), including 'web crawlers' and 'web scrapers', to study these threats. The rapid proliferation of ADCT has meant directions for their ethical and legal operation have been slow to adapt, with no clear guidelines regulating their use for research. This article identifies the relevant ethical and legal frameworks guiding the deployment of ADCT in Australia for cybersecurity research. This is accomplished through a systematic review of research within this context, coupled with ethical and jurisprudential analysis. We argue that the use of ADCT can be both ethical and legal, but only where mitigating measures are implemented. We provide a series of practical directions to guide researchers and practitioners when navigating this novel terrain.
Cybercrime tackling is a major challenge for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). Traditional digital forensics and investigation procedures are not coping with the sheer amount of data to analyse, which is stored in multiple devices seized from distinct, possibly-related cases. Moreover, inefficient information representation and exchange hampers evidence recovery and relationship discovery. Aiming at a better balance between human reasoning skills and computer processing capabilities, this paper discusses how semantic technologies could make cybercrime investigation more efficient. It takes the example of online banking fraud to propose an ontology aimed at mapping criminal organisations and identifying malware developers. Although still on early stage of development, it reviews concepts to extend from well-established ontologies and proposes novel abstractions that could enhance relationship discovery. Finally, it suggests inference rules based on empirical knowledge which could better address the needs of the human analyst.
While traditional crime rates are decreasing, cybercrime is on the rise. As a result, the criminal justice system is increasingly dealing with criminals committing cyber-dependent crimes. However, to date there are no effective interventions to prevent recidivism in this type of offenders. Dutch authorities have developed an intervention program, called Hack_Right. Hack_Right is an alternative criminal justice program for young first-offenders of cyber-dependent crimes. In order to prevent recidivism, this program places participants in organizations where they are taught about ethical hacking, complete (technical) assignments and reflect on their offense. In this study, we have evaluated the Hack_Right program and the pilot interventions carried out thus far. By examining the program theory (program evaluation) and implementation of the intervention (process evaluation), the study adds to the scarce literature about cybercrime interventions. During the study, two qualitative research methods have been applied: 1) document analysis and 2) interviews with intervention developers, imposers, implementers and participants. In addition to the observation that the scientific basis for linking specific criminogenic factors to cybercriminals is still fragile, the article concludes that the theoretical base and program integrity of Hack_Right need to be further developed in order to adhere to principles of effective interventions.
The Internet and computer-mediated communications (CMCs) have drastically changed the way that individuals communicate and share information across the globe. Over the last two decades, financial institutions, private industry, and governments have come to rely on technology in order to access sensitive data and manage critical infrastructure, such as electrical power grids. As a consequence, the threat posed by cybercriminals has increased dramatically and afforded significant opportunities for terrorist groups and extremist organizations to further their objectives. The complex and intersecting nature of both crime and terror make it difficult to clearly separate these issues, particularly in virtual environments, due to the anonymous nature of CMCs and challenges to actor attribution. Thus, this study examines the various definitions for physical and cyberterror and the ways that these activities intersect with cybercrime. In addition, the ways that terrorists and extremist groups use the Internet and CMCs to recruit individuals, spread misinformation, and gather intelligence on various targets are discussed. Finally, the uses of computer hacking tools and malware are explored as a way to better understand the relationship between cybercrime and terror.
The aim of the current study was to analyze the cybercrimes and violations of intellectual property law on the indigenous Papuans in Indonesia, particularly when technology and innovations are spreading fast in Papua. The study makes a thorough literature review in this regard in order to ensure a maximum outreach to information present on the factors and characteristics that enhance cybercrimes and that lead to violations of intellectual property laws. A qualitative non-empirical legal research approach was used in this study, according to which extraction of information and data was done from various legal documents, cases and laws from Papua, Indonesia. The current laws, regulations and policies protecting intellectual property laws against cybercrime were also analyzed, discussed and their shortcomings were presented and defined. A few recommendations were also provided for the betterment of the security of intellectual property laws against cybercrime in Papua, Indonesia. There is a requirement of novel comprehensive cybercrime law that significantly focuses on all different methods in which the intellectual property rights are now violated.
Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is a non-punitive method for reducing crime through the design of the built environment. The relevance of CPTED strategies, however, is less clear in the context of computing environments. Building upon prior research indicating that computing environments may change computer users' behaviors, this study tests the effectiveness of CPTED-based approaches in mitigating system-trespassing events. Findings from this randomized controlled field trial demonstrate that specific CPTED strategies can mitigate hacking events by reducing the number of concurrent activities on the target computer, attenuating the number of commands typed in the attacked computer, and decreasing the likelihood of hackers returning to a previously hacked environment. Our findings suggest some novel and readily implemented strategies for reducing cybercrime.
"Without a comprehensive cybercrime law, it is difficult for any country to prevent cybercrimes. Cybercrimes are committed using Internet and information technology related tools. This paper highlights how a few constructs such as conventional views of cybercrime; information about the types of cybercrime available at community level; role of the cyber police and use of information technology for its investigation can assist in framing constitutional laws to prevent cybercrimes in Indonesia. In a qualitative framework, using document survey as the research tool, this study describes how the constitutional law should control and guide the transmission of the conventional view about cybercrimes at the community level. It also suggests measures to interpret and assist in the investigation of any problems and inequalities, with the help of cyber police and information technology aids. The results and findings reveal that the current Indonesian laws related to prevention of cybercrimes are inadequate and require over-hauling. There is a need to judge how cyber criminals execute crimes and prepare legal clauses and provisions accordingly to curb them. The study findings will be a good source of reference for lawmakers and other experts who could be benefited with the recommendations of this study"
Cyber black markets for hacking tools or services are gaining widespread attention as more advanced persistent threat attacks are relevant to such markets. In July 2016, the ATM heist of Taiwan First bank is based on well-known Carberp malware family, which is available for sharing, sale or cooperation on such markets. This study reviews organizational cybercrime activities and ATM threats, and proposes an ICT governance framework in online ATM heist management. This framework further points out capable people, efficient process, effective technology, and data governance. This framework is potentially useful for cybercrime prevention.
The increasing use of a variety of devices that can access the Internet has contributed to the overall growth of Internet use. The growth of Internet use also leads to a general increase in cybercrime concerns as well as the number of users' victims of this permanent threat. This reality is also very present in Portugal where there is a sense of lack of control and combat of this kind of cyber-threats. In this context, it is important to know some indicators associated with cybercrime, in order to take the best measures/actions in a reasoned way, to combat this phenomenon. This article presents the results of a study carried out in 2017 by the European Commission, whose analysis helps to understand the Portuguese positioning in the concerns and experiences about cybercrime, in relation to the average of the European Community citizens. Analysing this study, it was possible to perceive that the Portuguese's concerns about cybercrime are in line with the average of the European citizens, although the percentage of Portuguese experienced these attacks is, for now, below average. Based on these results, it is possible to identify some public policies that aim to mitigate this phenomenon.
Criminological inquiry consistently identifies a gender difference in offending rates, which are also evident among certain forms of cybercrime. The gender difference in cybercrime offending is particularly large within computer hacking, though few have specifically addressed this issue through applications of criminological theory. The current study attempted to account for the gender disparity in hacking through a test of power-control theory, which considers the role of class and family structure. This analysis also incorporated an extension of power-control theory through the influence of low self-control. Using data from the Second International Self-Report of Delinquency study (ISRD-2), logistic regression analyses were estimated, producing partial support for both theories to account for hacking. Implications for theory and research were explored in detail.
This review article highlights the current state of cybercrime scholarship published by criminologists in the areas of computer hacking, malware, fraud, and various economically motivated offenses. Areas for future study are identified and explored in detail.
At the fortieth anniversary of reform and opening-up, the socialist market economy reform has entered a deep-water area. With the rapid development of economy and society, the demand for material and cultural resources has been expanding, coupled with the explosive growth of information brought by the rapid development of the Internet, complex social life has brought psychological and material impacts on young people who are far from mature. Under the new situation, juvenile delinquency has entered an unprecedented stage. The total number of juvenile delinquency has been rising, and the proportion of juvenile delinquency in the total number of criminal of fences in China has remained high, which has attracted wide attention from all walks of life. Therefore, this paper chooses domestic juvenile delinquency as the research object under the new situation.
India has witnessed an exponential growth of internet users in the recent years and the cybercrime which resulted as unavoidable byproduct of greater internet usages, has also witnessed an exponential growth. User's Internet habits play an important role in cybercrime victimization. In the present study, a cross- sectional study was done among various sections of internet users in the district of Gautambuddh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. Cyber awareness, cybercrime victimization, exposer to motivated offenders (internet hours per day), online security measure awareness, popularity of social media platforms, sources of online information and online habits of the internet users were examined for ascertaining the presence of gendered differences (if any). Cyber awareness in females was found to be significantly more than the males in seven items out of the twelve items of the cyber awareness construct. Majority of the respondents felt that women were soft target of cybercrimes. Males outnumbered the females significantly in watching pornographic content online. Males were found significantly exposed more to internet than the males. Females were found to be significantly less aware than males as far as online security measures were concerned. Males were found to be using social media sites significantly more than the females. Gendered differences were also found between accessing the sources of online information.
Cybercrime and cybersecurity are like two sides of the same coin: They are opposites but cannot exist without each other. Their mutual relation generates a myriad of ethical issues, ranging from minor to vital. The rapid development of technology will surely involve even more ethical concerns, like the infamous example of a fitness tracking company allegedly paying $10 million worth of ransom. Every cybersecurity solution, tool, or practice has to be ethical by design if it is to protect people and their rights. To identify the ethical issues that cybersecurity/cybercrime might bring about in the future, we conducted the first broad and comprehensive horizon-scanning study since the COVID-19 pandemic arose. As we began this project, nobody had the slightest idea that the coming months would bring the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the reality we had known was about to change dramatically. As it soon became apparent, the deadly coronavirus brought completely new cybersecurity/cybercrime ethical dilemmas to light, and some of the ones known before were transformed or shifted. This article presents the results of our horizon-scanning study concerning the ethical dilemmas that emerged amid the COVID-19 pandemic. (c) 2021 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

"The purpose of the article is to study the theoretical foundations and applied recom-mendations for the development of international law in the context of economic and legal analysis of financial measures to combat cybercrime in the global environment. Based on the results of the research, it was found that the development of international law is under the influence of significant destabilizing factors of a legal, political, eco-nomic and social nature and has a significant impact on the financial and economic system of the country because a specific share of cybercrimes is related to the commis-sion of offences in the financial and economic system. The low level of effectiveness of international law in regulating legal relations financial and economic nature in cyber-space was revealed. The intensification of economic crime has been proven in the virtual environment has been proven. As a result of research carried out by the countries of the European Union and Ukraine regarding the identification of trends in the interna-tional legal regulation of the system of financial measures against cyber risks and mod-ern cyber threats, as well as the formation of methods and measures for combating economic cybercrime, it was established that among the countries selected for analysis, three groups are distinguished, characterized by common signs: highly developed coun-tries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Por-tugal, Finland, Sweden), where the high indicators of ensuring the protection of cyber-space against criminal encroachments of a financial and economic nature are positioned, however, there are certain problems that need to be solved; developing countries (Slo-venia, Estonia, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, France, Slovakia, the Czech Re-public), where high indicators of cyberspace protection are positioned, however, there are certain problems that need to be solved; developing countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Ukraine), in which there are significant prob-lems of ensuring cyber security and economic and legal regulation of systemic counter-action to cyber risks and cyber threats, arising in the financial and economic sphere. Ways to strengthen the influence of international law on the system of financial coun-termeasures against cybercrime are proposed, namely: improvement of international law norms on increasing the level of cyber security of the financial and economic sphere of the state based on the innovative development of information technologies and the convergence of artificial intelligence technologies; strengthening of international legal regulation of economic aspects of activity and protection of producers of information and communication technologies; strengthening the protection of information flows containing information on the implementation of financial and economic transactions in cyberspace"
This paper contributes to current debates on the policing of Internet fraud by introducing the Saudi Arabian experience. Drawing on field research in the capital city, Riyadh, it assesses the extent to which the Saudi policing response to Internet fraud fits in with contemporary debates on cybercrime control within a late-modern penal framework as theorised in Western literature. It is argued that the only way in which Saudi cybercrime control strategies can be aligned with those followed by Western authorities is in relation to the state's expressive gestures'. In contrast, there is little evidence of plural policing involving networks of calculation deploying instrumental ordering practices and risk-prediction technologies. In addition to the limited relevance in an autocratic society such as Saudi Arabia of the ideological, socio-economic and political conditions that facilitated the emergence of plural policing in Western societies, the Saudi police organisation also appeared unready to engage in networked policing of Internet fraud.
The aim of the article is to analyze current trends in the development of cyber insurance. The following methods of scientific research were used in the preparation of the article: generalization, correlation analysis, comparative analysis. The authors analyze in detail the main trends in the spread of cybercrime. The correlation analysis between the number of registered cybercrimes in a particular country and its GDP, the number of business entities, indicated the lack of correlation between the studied indicators. It states that the most common types of cybercrime are: hacking, unauthorized access, accidental exposure, insider and physical theft. The sectoral analysis of the distribution of cybercrime has revealed a decrease in the share of financial companies while increasing the share of health care companies. It is noted that cyber insurance is one of the effective preventive measures that minimize the negative effects of cybercrime intervention. The article presents segmentation of the cyber insurance market by geography and size of insurance companies. The results of the analysis showed the dominance of US companies in the cyber insurance market. It is stated that the sectoral distribution of cybersecurity policy purchasers in general follows the trends of the sectoral distribution of cybercrime. The volume of cyber insurance, expenses of insured legal entities is analyzed. The main trends in the development of cyber insurance have been identified. The factors that hold back the development of cyber risk insurance have been identified. The main ones include the following: high level of information entropy in the process of cyber risk assessment, lack of a single standard for filling insurance services in the field of cyber insurance. It is noted that in the medium term the cyber insurance market is prospective for insurance companies. This is caused by the increasing scale of cyber threats and the costs associated with cyberattacks.
In a landmark nondecision last term, five Justices of the United States Supreme Court would have held that citizens possess a Fourth Amendment right to expect that certain quantities of information about them will remain private, even if they have no such expectations with respect to any of the information or data constituting that whole. This quantitative approach to evaluating and protecting Fourth Amendment rights is certainly novel and raises serious conceptual, doctrinal, and practical challenges. In other works, we have met these challenges by engaging in a careful analysis of this mosaic theory and by proposing that courts focus on the technologies that make collecting and aggregating large quantities of information possible. In those efforts, we focused on reasonable expectations held by the people that they will not be subjected to broad and indiscriminate surveillance. These expectations are anchored in Founding-era concerns about the capacity for unfettered search powers to promote an authoritarian surveillance state. Although we also readily acknowledged that there are legitimate and competing governmental and law enforcement interests at stake in the deployment and use of surveillance technologies that implicate reasonable interests in quantitative privacy, we did little more. In this Article, we begin to address that omission by focusing on the legitimate governmental and law enforcement interests at stake in preventing, detecting, and prosecuting cyberharassment and healthcare fraud.
Network disruption has become commonplace in Ethiopia in the past few years. Be it for preventing exam leaks, the spread of disinformation, or to fight off cyber-attacks, the government has repeatedly disrupted communication networks. However, the legal basis with which the government often shuts down the Internet or disrupts other means of digital communications remains unclear. Despite a recent attempt by the Federal Attorney General to offer some legal justification, the legality of network disruptions under Ethiopia law is questionable. This short article considers the legality of network disruptions under Ethiopian law. Having rejected the legal justifications of the Attorney General, this article argues that the current cybercrime legislation offers a rather sound legal basis for certain forms of network disruption in Ethiopia. It further considers the pertinence of rules dealing with network disruption introduced in the cybercrime Bill (2020). The article suggests that the Bill's network disruption rules are mostly progressive, but there remains the need for a freestanding legal framework equipped with appropriate safeguards against arbitrary practices.
The objective of this paper is to assess the validity and reliability of a questionnaire proposed for measuring fear of crime. Following extensive theoretical research in the field, the questionnaire was operationalised and defines fear of crime in three components: cognitive, affective and behavioural. It extends the measurement of the traditional fear of crime in the physical environment to the fear of cybercrime. The data were collected from 207 citizens of the city of Ljubljana. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability was assessed by Cronbach alpha and by Composite reliability. The measurement instrument exhibited good measurement characteristics. All three components of fear of crime had two dimensions - ordinary and cybercrime. To date, no consensus on the instrument to be used to measure fear of crime has been reached by researchers. Several measures that are used pertain to ordinary crime only - they omit the fear of cybercrime, lack information on validity and reliability, and tend to measure just the affective component of fear of crime. The proposed questionnaire attempts to overcome these shortcomings.
This reply to Valverde seeks to examine what she means by speaking of the logics of security. After critiquing the elements she uses to characterize such projects it then applies her approach to the examples of fighting cybercrime and creating global social indicators.
The relative glut of data on cybercriminal forums has led to a growing understanding of the functioning of these virtual marketplaces. But with a focus on illicit online trading, less attention has been paid to the structures of groups that carry out cybercrimes in an operational sense. In economic parlance, some such groups may be known as firms. This concept has been a significant part of the literature on more traditional forms of organised crime, but is not widely discussed in the cybercrime discourse. The focus of this article is, by way of a case study of the Gozi malware group, to explore the applicability of the concept of firms to the novel environment of cybercrime.
In this article we approach the problem of attributing a cyberattack to real world actors, and the social context of the problem. The basic premise is that while it is socially acceptable to assign attribution of cybercrime after the act, society expects law enforcement to attribute the possibility of cyberterrorist acts to perpetrators in advance, and to disrupt them in the making. This blends the cyberattack attribution problem with the much wider problem of fighting terrorism and organized cybercrime, far beyond the limits of cyber understood as the fifth domain of warfare. The main contribution of the paper is identifying research gaps and attributing complexities derived from key problems such as offline criminal activity, as well as practical difficulties in researching cybercrime and cyberterrorism. To get to those conclusions, we analysed the attribution problem from the point of view of the perpetrator, using the SWOT methodology, which gave us insight on tactics of cyberattacks that give the most protection against attribution and prosecution, which led us to identifying current research gaps.
Objectives: Investigate the relationship between thoughtfully reflective decision-making (TRDM) and computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and computer-focused cybercrime victimization. Method: Survey data collected from samples of 1,039 employees and 418 students at a large private university were analyzed using ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression to test the effects of TRDM on computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and victimization. Results: TRDM reduces computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and computer-focused cybercrime victimization across measures and samples. The sensitivity analyses also indicated that TRDM is a more robust predictor of cyber deviance involvement than victimization. The results from moderation analyses showed that, whereas protective effects of TRDM are invariant across genders, they are less salient among older employees for the scenario-based measure of cybercrime victimization. Conclusions: Individual-level cognitive decision-making processes are important in predicting computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and victimization. These results can inform the development of targeted institutional and criminal justice policies aimed at reducing computer-focused cybercrime.
Cybercriminals are commonly assumed to engage in cybercrime for monetary rewards. Like traditional offenders, they must launder their illicit proceeds to obscure the permanent trails in online environments. The mainstream narrative argues that these offenders engage in complex money laundering schemes because of the use of new technologies. However, empirical research on the money laundering activities associated with cybercrime has been scarce. To address this knowledge gap, the present study analyzes money laundering transactions from 182 Bitcoin addresses belonging to 56 members of the Conti ransomware group using blockchain analysis. The results show that offenders are quite unsophisticated when laundering their illicit proceeds. Most of the addresses transact directly with an entity (52%) and concentrate 80% or more of the illicit proceeds in one singular service (69%). In terms of destinations, exchanges and dark web services are the preferred choices, being involved in 71% and 30% of the transactions respectively. Conversely, the use of mixers is more limited (8%). There are significant differences in money laundering strategies used by offenders based on the amounts of illicit proceeds to launder. Implications for research and policy are discussed.
The central question of this article is: To what extent and how do the needs of victims of cybercrime deviate from the needs of victims of traditional offline offenses? In total, 19 victims and 22 experts were interviewed. Our study shows that victims of online offenses have the same needs as victims of traditional offenses: ranging from emotional or financial needs to information needs. However, victims? needs are often not met. Victims state that in most cases, they are not acknowledged as a victim, that no statement is recorded by the police, or no investigation is started.
Previous research suggests a link between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and criminal behaviour. The present study explored the relationship between ADHD symptoms and cyberdeviance. 170 participants completed an online questionnaire measuring computer crime behaviour, ADHD symptoms, and impulsivity. A statistically significant relationship was found between Cyberdeviance, ADHD symptoms and impulsivity. Regression analysis showed that hyperactivity and gender (male) could predict self-reported computer crime. Our findings suggest a role of individual differences in cybercrime, thus leading to the development of potential interventions and preventive mechanisms.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, before the power of online social networking became apparent, several studies speculated about the likely structure of organised cybercrime. In the light of new data on cybercriminal organisations, this paper sets out to revisit their claims. This paper examines the structure of organised cybercrime by analysing data from online underground markets previously in operation over the Internet. In order to understand the various structures of organised cybercrime which have manifested, theories are drawn from social psychology, organised crime and transaction cost economics (TCE). Since the focus is on how uncertainty is mitigated in trading among cybercriminals, uncertainty is treated as a cost to the transactions and is used as the unit of analysis to examine the mechanisms cybercriminals use to control two key sources of uncertainty: the quality of merchandise and the identity of the trader. The findings indicate that carding forums facilitate organised cybercrime because they offer a hybrid form of organisational structure that is able to address sources of uncertainty and minimise transaction costs to an extent that allows a competitive underground market to emerge. The findings from this study can be used to examine other online applications that could facilitate the online underground economy.
This is a brief comment on a meeting held at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which discussed ways of improving transnational access to data by law enforcement through the Cybercrime Convention. In particular, the possible introduction of a new protocol, and a guidance note on art. 32(b), were considered. It is argued that there are serious concerns with both proposals. Moreover, the meeting revealed a surprising lack of knowledge as to current levels of cooperation between law enforcement and foreign service providers. (C) 2013 Micheal O'Floinn.

In modern era digital devices are the part and parcel in everyday life. Easy access to internet across the globe has totally changed the pattern of life. Web has become the main source of acquiring knowledge and information. Email is replacing the postal mail system. Use of computer is a mandatory from primary education sector to government level enterprise. Facebook, twitter, whatsapp, viber are becoming main way to social communication. All these developments made life of people easier and comfortable but at the same time crimes associated with technologies have also emerged especially in a developing country like Bangladesh. Cybercrime has become a vital issue. This study conveys an in-depth survey about the awareness of cybercrime amongst the people of Bangladesh. Both online and offline version of the survey were created to conduct this study. The study finds that there is a patchy awareness level and it is not satisfactory. The general people are unaware of standard practices for cybersecurity. The government and respective organizations is not vibrant regarding cybercrime related issues. A proper guideline is required. Also it needs to be updated on timely manner. Additionally, Pearson's Chi-squared test was conducted for in-depth analysis. Finally, it can be said that there exists an urgency to implement a prototype for cybersecurity to combat with cyber threats.
"Cybercrime has rapidly grown in prevalence and potential for harm and disruption for victims. Studies have examined the adverse psychological impact of cybercrime for victims; however, the specific effects for victims of hacking are unexplored. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts of hacking victimization through exploration of the experience of victims of hacking. The study employed an in-depth phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of 11 victims of hacking. Semi-structured interviews were used as a tool for data collection, and thematic analysis of the data revealed four main themes: emotional impact; an increased sense of vulnerability; a sense of violation; and coping strategies. The findings highlight that hacking may have significant consequences for victims, and further, that hacking may represent an intrusion into a victim's digital space. Recommendations are discussed for providing support to victims through measures aimed at increasing victim's self-efficacy, sense of control over their digital environment, and increasing community awareness about the potential adverse impacts for victims of hacking."
This study seeks to understand romance scam from the offenders' perspective and how they rationalize their motivations, opportunities and abilities towards the commission of the crime. To this end, we adopt the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability framework and the Rationalization dimension of the Fraud Triangle Theory. The study employed a qualitative methodological approach to analyze the opportunities presented by emerging technologies to cyber fraudsters amid socio-economic drivers. One is the interplay of various socio-economic factors being a major driving force behind the commission of cybercrime. These include peer recruitment and training, poverty, unemployment, low level of education and low income. The uniqueness of this study stems from the fact that it deviates from previous studies to investigate cybercrime from the perspective of the perpetrators. Again, this study is arguably one of the first to put all three dimensions of the MOA framework and the rationalization dimension of the Fraud Triangle to study romance scammers' behaviors.
Situational Crime Prevention (SCP) is a criminological approach that is shown to reduce crime opportunities drawing from five different strategies comprising 25 techniques. With the global increase in cybercrime, practitioners and researchers are increasingly investigating opportunities for applying SCP strategies and techniques to prevent cyber-focused and cyber-enabled crimes. Recent research proposes ways that SCP can be applied to cybercrime. Yet most of this research utilizes only a few of the SCP techniques and the linkages between the SCP techniques and opportunities for reducing cybercrimes are rarely made explicit. In this paper we evaluate the relevance of the full spectrum of SCP techniques to cybercrime and explicate how computer scientists, cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers and practitioners apply SCP principles to prevent and control cyber-enabled crime. Through a focused systematic review of 352 articles across computer science, criminal justice and criminology literature using the PRISMA method, this paper clarifies terminologies, explores the rise of cybercrimes, and explains the value of SCP for responding to cybercrimes. We provide a review of the current research undertaken to apply SCP to cybercrimes and conclude with a discussion on research gaps and potential future areas of research. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Cybercrime is all about the crimes involved with the environment where ever a network is involved and the steps implemented to control or overcome this cyber-security. The work culture of all the sectors are moving towards digitalization and cloud based systems in order to increase the work efficiency with more accuracy, In addition to this a majority of individuals are fond of using social networking sites and email servers in many ways directly or indirectly. Cybercrime is a type of crime where technical expertise is required not only to crack it but in order to make a user secure or to apply any preventive majors. In this paper we have described about the basics of this dreadful crime, recent research & development in the field of cyber security, the types of crimes and a small survey with an IT company. Our aim with this research is to check the awareness level of cybercrime and security majors and to suggest necessary steps which can really be helpful in making the cyber environment secure, robust and trustworthy.
Efforts by governments, over the years, to curb cybercrime- yahoo-yahoo- in Nigeria have not yielded much positive results. The restrictive measures put in place by cyber security operatives, law enforcement agencies and the government have only largely resulted in operational dynamism of cybercriminals including introduction of spiritual/fetish dimensions to cybercrime- yahoo-yahoo- which has come to be known as yahoo-plus. The empirical basis for this paper was from in-depth interviews with 15 yahoo boys and 30 community members' in Ajibode, Apete and Ring road regarding the community reactions and obstacles to curbing yahoo plus in Nigeria with Ibadan as case study. Findings' suggest that yahoo boys get help from many places to perpetrate their crimes. Sources of help include the families, musicians, celebrities, religious leaders., politicians, police officers and bank officials. These sources of help to yahoo boys are obstacles to curbing yahoo boys- including yahoo plus activities, in Nigeria.
Nowadays it is crucial for maintaining security defence on devices against cybercrimes over the Internet. None of the existing systems proved to be flawless, though various approaches have been used to counter cybercrime activities. This paper proposes a real time model for identifying and collecting cybercrime evidences. In particular, the proposed model comprises three main components, rules-based IDS for cybercrimes monitoring and identifying their features. Database for collecting and storing features of new cybercrimes and BASE for result viewing in real time. Features installed on Raspberry Pi, were dedicated for data collection process. The proposed model is efficient in identifying and collecting network cybercrimes evidences in real time based on the result demonstrated.
Along with the increasing use of online communication during the current Covid-19 pandemic, people have become more active in the social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, whether it be through by posting their content online or by reading the posts of others. Undoubtedly, it has a negative impact in the form of cybercrimes, especially when public understanding of cyber law is still low. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identifying cybercrime on social media posts, with case studies on Indonesian cybercrime law. The main challenge in solving the problem is the use of informal language and non-standard writing. Therefore, we exploit the informative value of terms in that post by paying attention to standard patterns in Indonesian grammar and writing structure with a classifier based on the voting ensemble learning model. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperformed baselines, with an accuracy of more than 90%. Thus, it proves the effectiveness of the approach in generalizing the content of social media posts according to the category of cybercrime law.
Cybercrime also called Computer crime, is any crime that involves a computer and a network. As individuals and businesses increase their reliance on technology, they are exposed to the growing cybercrime threats. Using the computers for our day-to-day transactions is quite common now a days. For example, we pay our life insurance premium, electricity bills, reserve flight or train or bus tickets, order book or any other product online using personal computer, smart phones, public browsing centers etc. The number of users doing online transactions are growing rapidly ever since, because of the convenience it gives to the user to transact business without being physically present in the area where the transaction happens. Criminals committing cybercrime are also growing day-by-day with the increased number of users doing online transactions. Cybercrime covers a wide range of different attacks such as Cyber extortion, Cyber warfare, spreading Computer viruses or Malware, Internet fraud, Spamming, Phishing, carding (fraud), child pornography and intellectual property rights violation etc. Because of increased cyber-attacks these days, the online users must be aware of this kind of attacks and need to cautions while doing online transactions. In this context, the paper will review the growth of cybercrimes in India and measures taken by the government of India to combat the cybercrimes.
Research on cyber-co-offending tends to focus on either the organizational structure of organized cybercrime or social learning processes among individuals. This paper provides a new perspective on co-offending by examining the extent to which individuals co-offend for different types of cybercrime compared to traditional crime. Additionally, differences in the type of co-offender (friends, family, or others) and relationships between ITknowledge and cyber-co-offending are examined. This paper is based on individual self-report survey data from a judicial sample of Dutch adult cyber-dependent offenders and traditional offenders. It includes information on 466 different crimes (51.50% cybercrime) self-reported by 164 individuals. Results indicate that cybercrime and traditional crime show similar patterns of co-offending. The majority of offenders prefer to commit their crimes alone, but some types of crime are more often committed with co-offenders than other types of crime. For cybercrime results suggest that limitations in an offender's IT-knowledge may be a reason to seek co-offenders with strong IT-skills.
"People are the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain when viewed in the context of technological advancement. People become vulnerable to trickery through contemporary technical developments such as social media platforms. Information accessibility and flow have increased rapidly and effectively; however, due to this increase, new electronic risks, or so-called cybercrime, such as phishing, scams, and hacking, lead to privacy breaches and hardware sabotage. Therefore, ensuring data privacy is vital, particularly in an educational institute where students constitute the large majority of users. Students or trainees violate cybersecurity policies due to their lack of awareness about the cybersecurity environment and the consequences of cybercrime. This paper aims to assess the level of awareness of cybersecurity, users' activities, and user responses to cybersecurity issues. This paper collected data based on a distributed questionnaire among trainees in the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC) to demonstrate the necessity of increasing user awareness and training. In this study, quantitative research techniques were utilized to analyze the responses from trainees using tests such as the Chi-Squared test. Proof of the reliability of the survey was provided using Cronbach's alpha test. This research identifies the deficiencies in cybersecurity awareness among TVTC trainees. After analyzing the gathered data, recommendations for tackling these shortcomings were offered, with the aim of enhancing trainees' decision-making skills regarding privacy and security using the Nudge model."
Research SummaryEuropean law enforcement agencies have begun to use targeted online ad campaigns to raise cybercrime awareness among at-risk populations. Despite their rapid proliferation, there is little research to support their efficacy and effectiveness. This study uses a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design to evaluate the effect of seven campaigns deployed in 2021 and 2022 on the volume of (distributed) denial-of-service or (D)DoS-attacks recorded in six European countries: Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Portugal. The results show mixed effects, suggesting that the campaigns are not clearly effective in reducing DDoS-attacks in the short term.Policy ImplicationsLaw enforcement has partly justified the use of targeted online ad campaigns on the premise that they reduce DDoS-attacks. However, this study shows that the evidence in this regard is inconclusive. If public support for the use of such campaigns is to be secured in the long term, law enforcement will likely need to rely on stronger arguments. The effect of this type of campaigns needs to be further investigated.
Cybercrime or the computer-related crime is the most widespread form of transnational crime, which is in its social and economic characteristics significantly different from traditional and organized crime. Cyberspace offers countless opportunities for economic development, social interaction, and political cooperation, but also provides tools for illegal surveillance, personal data collection, influencing democratic processes, committing crimes, and exchanging numerous ways and methods of warfare. This paper provides an overview of legal documents in the Republic of Serbia related to information security, data security, and deviant behavior in cyberspace, with special emphasis on the analysis of the Strategy for Information Society Development and Information Security in the Republic of Serbia for 2021-2026. Using the criminological approach, this paper focuses on legislation concerning existing criminal offenses related to cybercrime and various forms of other criminal activities, but also on the international cooperation that Serbia achieves in the field of information and cyber security.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of technology-facilitated crimes against children worldwide has increased substantially and become one of the most serious crime problems. Due to these considerations, there is a lack of large-scale systematic reviews investigating Cybercrime in and of itself could be challenging to investigate in comparison to traditional ones due to the elusiveness of the cyber realm. Specifically, investigating internet crimes against children comes with specific challenges. These offenses target vulnerable children who are less likely to realize their victimization, lowering the probability of reporting to the proper authorities. With these obstacles in mind, this research study utilizes data information regarding the characteristics of online CSAM users and their practices to inform law enforcement, parents, and the public for preventative and strategic purposes. Furthermore, this study diagnoses the significant challenges of investigating technology-facilitated crimes against children by examining how the current criminal justice system responds to these incidents. The policy recommendations discussed offer a holistic lens for highlighting this critical issue and implementing practical and proactive training solutions for law enforcement and the public.
In Geekonomics. The Real Cost of Insecure Software, David Rice argues that market forces drive most software manufacturers to pay scant attention to security. This paper reviews Mr. Rice's arguments taking into account the irruption of the Internet of Things (IoT). First, the document explores if the economic and societal forces driving the behaviors that result in insecure software will be modified by the IoT and, if so, how. Afterward, it investigates if the outcomes generated by insecure software, including the proliferation of safety risks and cybercrime, and the potential remedies outlined by Mr. Rice to correct said outcomes will remain or be altered by the IoT. The inquiry leads to the conclusion that, on both counts, the analysis presented in Geekonomics is still valid.
BACKGROUND: Recent legislation empowering providers to embrace the electronic exchange of health information leaves the healthcare industry increasingly vulnerable to cybercrime. The objective of this systematic review is to identify the biggest threats to healthcare via cybercrime. OBJECTIVE: The rationale behind this systematic review is to provide a framework for future research by identifying themes and trends of cybercrime in the healthcare industry. METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic search through the CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases to gather literature relative to cyber threats in healthcare. All authors reviewed the articles collected and excluded literature that did not focus on the objective. RESULTS: Researchers selected and examined 19 articles for common themes. The most prevalent cyber-criminal activity in healthcare is identity theft through data breach. Other concepts identified are internal threats, external threats, cyber-squatting, and cyberterrorism. CONCLUSIONS: The industry has now come to rely heavily on digital technologies, which increase risks such as denial of service and data breaches. Current healthcare cyber-security systems do not rival the capabilities of cyber criminals. Security of information is a costly resource and therefore many HCOs may hesitate to invest what is required to protect sensitive information.
Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency that has experienced proliferating popularity over the past few years, is the common denominator in a wide variety of cybercrime. We perform a measurement analysis of CryptoLocker, a family of ransomware that encrypts a victim's files until a ransom is paid, within the Bitcoin ecosystem from September 5, 2013 through January 31, 2014. Using information collected from online fora, such as reddit and BitcoinTalk, as an initial starting point, we generate a cluster of 968 Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker. We provide a lower bound for CryptoLocker's economy in Bitcoin and identify 795 ransom payments totalling 1,128.40 BTC ($310,472.38), but show that the proceeds could have been worth upwards of $1.1 million at peak valuation. By analyzing ransom payment timestamps both longitudinally across CryptoLocker's operating period and transversely across times of day, we detect changes in distributions and form conjectures on CryptoLocker that corroborate information from previous efforts. Additionally, we construct a network topology to detail CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure and obtain auxiliary information on the CryptoLocker operation. Most notably, we find evidence that suggests connections to popular Bitcoin services, such as Bitcoin Fog and BTC-e, and subtle links to other cybercrimes surrounding Bitcoin, such as the Sheep Marketplace scam of 2013. We use our study to underscore the value of measurement analyses and threat intelligence in understanding the erratic cybercrime landscape.
This study tests the effects of behavioral and cognitive measures of self-control on computer-focused cyber deviance and cyber victimization with survey data from 1,036 adult employees. We examine moderating effects of cyber deviant peers and gender in the relationship between self-control, and cyber deviance and victimization. Cognitive and behavioral measures of self-control are negativity associated with cyber deviance, whereas only behavioral self-control predicted reduced cyber victimization. Moderation analyses show that cyber deviant peer associations condition the relationship between self-control, and both cyber deviance and victimization. Gender moderation models reveal no consistent significant effects. The results have implications for the understanding of cognitive predictors of computer-focused cybercrime and victimization, as well as institutional cybercrime prevention policies. Our findings can inform the future integration of self-control and social learning theories in cyberspace.
Fraud has been identified as one of the most prevalent property crimes in the Internet era and underreporting represents one of the most pressing challenges to prevention and policing. Like fraud itself, the issue is not new and therefore traditional findings and approaches designed to foster reporting may also be applicable to online fraud. This study performs a series of regression models to analyse data on fraud victims from two editions of the representative Catalan Public Security Survey. The aim is to identify and compare socio-demographic, context and crime event determinants of online and offline fraud reporting, as well as the reasons for not reporting. Thus, the article contributes to the literature regarding cybercrime and traditional crime a/symmetries. The findings show that, surprisingly, online fraud is reported at a higher rate than offline fraud, mainly owing to the greater odds of being considered a crime by the victim. In general, fraud reporting appears to involve a rational component because financial and non-financial harms and the expected utility of reporting are more relevant to the decision than socio-demographic factors. In addition, the most common reasons for not reporting refer to the opportunity costs of doing so. The demographic predictors of online reporters show only slight differences from their offline counterparts, but more associations are found regarding the reasons for not reporting. Finally, the implications for policy are discussed.
In this paper we present the discussion about the future ideas, needs and trends for cyber security technologies. Our focus is on the future technologies which should be developed in order to further enhance the protection of the cyberspace. Similarly to our work in the FP7 CAMINO project, we follow the comprehensive approach looking at broad range of possible technologies and problems. We termed our approach as THOR since we considered the following dimensions: Technical, Human, Organisational and Regulatory. In this paper we also discuss the idea of the comprehensive approach, since we believe only holistic view on cyber security can improve protection from the cyber threats.
Cyber terrorism is the premeditated, politically motivated assault on information, computer systems, computer programmes, and data that results in violence against property, the government, and the general populace. In the age of globalisation, the use of steganography as a form of internet terrorist communication - Red Fort case, E-mail threats in Taj Mahal case, and Supreme Court E-mail Threat case. The use of the internet by terrorists to organise and execute the September 11 World Trade Centre attack reflects the current state of affairs and provides the answer to the question, Is the internet the new boon or bane of science?In India, cyber laws prohibit any crime committed with the aid of technology, where a computer is a tool for cybercrime. Cybercrime rules prevent citizens from sharing sensitive information with strangers online. Since the establishment of cyber laws in India, the IT Act 2000 was enacted in 2000 and updated in 2008 to cover all sorts of cyber offences in India. Without a doubt, India's Cyber security or Cyber laws give protection against cybercrime. However, prevention is always preferable to treatment.Cyber law and cyber crimes have also become more complicated in today's technologically advanced society. Internet and technology were developed for research purposes and to make human life easier, but as the number of people using the internet in India expanded, the necessity for Cyber Laws became apparent. Due to the anonymous nature of the internet, it is simple to commit cybercrimes. Consequently, numerous individuals could abuse this component so extensively. Therefore, India has a need for cyber law.
"Internet fraud remains a problem in Ghana and thus attracts the attention of teachers, researchers, civil society organisations, the state and policymakers. Existing studies on Internet fraud focused on the reasons, combat strategies, cyber spiritualism, the impact of Internet fraud on individuals and the country, and the inadequate legal frameworks for handling such cybercrimes. Despite efforts by the government and other interest groups in fighting the menace, the phenomenon continues to increase among youth in Ghana. Applying Paul Willis' theory of ethnographic imagination, this study examined how Internet scammers-Sakawa boys-in the northern region of Ghana use their bodies and other cultural materials to express their identity and make meaning. The study reveals that Sakawa boys express their identities and make meaning using language-slang and jargon; conspicuous consumption of material goods; ostentatious lifestyle; techno-religiosity; and gender cyber-fraud collaboration. Thus, it offers a basal understanding of emic dimension of relationship between children and youth in cybercrime, unsuspected victims, and preventive measures. The study also gives theoretical contributions to research in understanding the broader socio-cultural milieu of children and youth in crimes and possible practical measures towards containment."
Reports of cybercrime have escalated over the past decade. While these crimes have increased, our understanding about the dynamics surrounding cyber offenders has not kept pace. Few studies have considered the characteristics of serious cyber criminals in comparison to other types of criminals. To fill this void in the literature, we examine a sample of cybercriminals appearing on the FBIs Most Wanted List and compare the characteristics of these offenders to other most wanted offenders. Results suggest that the most wanted cyber offenders are similar to other offenders in that it is a male-dominated offense category, but they are different from other offenders in that they are younger and more likely to exhibit certain types of physical and lifestyle characteristics. Implications for policy and future research are provided.
The techniques of device fingerprinting are used by many researchers for the purpose of user tracking or software licensing and user authentication. As most of the current fingerprinting approaches are using the software related parameters of the device which can be easily modified by the user. These existing solutions are not suitable for device fingerprinting from the perspective of network forensic investigation. The main objective of forensic investigation is to collect the evidences of the cybercrime in forensically sound manner to prove the role of criminal in the crime. To prove the crime in the court of law the reliable and relevant evidence against the criminal is very important. The most crucial evidence is the true identity of the device used for doing the cybercrime. To uniquely identify the real source of the crime device fingerprinting is the paramount solution. The up-to-date analysis is required to construct the new techniques for fingerprinting the physical devices, which will satisfy all the legal requirements and can be used as evidence in the court of law to prove the crime. The major objective of this paper is thus to provide a detailed analytical review of features and techniques of feature extraction that is used in existing device fingerprinting techniques.
Ransomware operations have evolved from relatively unsophisticated threat actors into highly coordinated cybercrime syndicates that regularly extort millions of dollars in a single attack. Despite dominating headlines and crippling businesses across the globe, there is relatively little in-depth research into the modern structure and economics of ransomware operations. In this paper, we leverage leaked chat messages to provide an in-depth empirical analysis of Conti, one of the largest ransomware groups. By analyzing these chat messages, we construct a picture of Conti's operations as a highly-profitable business, from profit structures to employee recruitment and roles. We present novel methodologies to trace ransom payments, identifying over $80 million in likely ransom payments to Conti and its predecessor - over five times as much as in previous public datasets. As part of our work, we will publish a dataset of 666 labeled Bitcoin addresses related to Conti and an additional 75 Bitcoin addresses of likely ransom payments. Future work can leverage this case study to more effectively trace - and ultimately counteract - ransomware activity.
The objective of this study is to demonstrate that individuals affiliated with diplomatic missions, including diplomats and administrators, are not immune to the jurisdiction of their home country's legal system. Consequently, individuals in diplomatic positions may be held responsible for any mistakes attributed to them in accordance with the provisions outlined in the Civil Service Law and relevant administrative regulations. This accountability remains applicable even if they are exempt from the jurisdiction of the host country's laws, as per the established principles of diplomatic judicial immunity. This study also examines the challenges and implications of cybercrime, specifically within the context of diplomatic missions. To achieve this objective, the present study has employed a methodological framework rooted in the field of jurisprudence. This involved gathering data from a variety of primary and secondary sources. The study employed a combination of descriptive and comparative analytical methodologies to examine the legislation of several Arab countries as well as the French legal system. The findings of this study indicate that national legislation establishes committees and entities that are specifically responsible for oversight, discipline, and the enforcement of penalties. These mechanisms operate in accordance with the principle of gradualism, which governs the legal framework for administrative accountability within diplomatic and consular missions. Consequently, competent authorities are obligated to refrain from engaging in any actions that could be construed as an abuse of authority or a departure from established procedures. Simultaneously, due consideration was given to the distinctive characteristics of these works within the realm of diplomatic service. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the host countries possess the authority to initiate legal proceedings against diplomatic agents in cases involving cybercrimes in accordance with their respective domestic legislation. The study concluded by providing a definition of the administrative work conducted by diplomatic missions, which are under the jurisdiction of the administrative judiciary. This control is implemented to ensure the effective execution of administrative functions and responsibilities within the host nation. This study presents various recommendations, highlighting the importance of granting immediate powers to the administrative judiciary in order to achieve favourable results.
Mobile devices are a huge influence for young people. About eighty-five percent of Mexico's population (around 96 millions) have a smartphone. A little less than sixty-five percent of Mexican users are below 35 years old. Young people are immerse in todays digital economy and it's difficult to be aware of good and bad stuff online. This paper aims to explain what are the most common cybercrime happening to undergraduate students. This research was done in Northeast Mexico with students of the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas.
"Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency, is often involved in illicit activities such as scamming, ransomware attacks, illegal goods trading, and thievery. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin ecosystem has not yet been mapped and as such there is no estimate of the share of illicit activities. This paper provides the first estimation of the portion of cyber-criminal entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our dataset consists of 854 observations categorised into 12 classes (out of which 5 are cybercrime-related) and a total of 100,000 uncategorised observations. The dataset was obtained from the data provider who applied three types of clustering of Bitcoin transactions to categorise entities: co-spend, intelligence-based, and behaviour-based. Thirteen supervised learning classifiers were then tested, of which four prevailed with a cross-validation accuracy of 77.38%, 76.47%, 78.46%, 80.76% respectively. From the top four classifiers, Bagging and Gradient Boosting classifiers were selected based on their weighted average and per class precision on the cybercrime-related categories. Both models were used to classify 100,000 uncategorised entities, showing that the share of cybercrime-related is 29.81% according to Bagging, and 10.95% according to Gradient Boosting with number of entities as the metric. With regard to the number of addresses and current coins held by this type of entities, the results are: 5.79% and 10.02% according to Bagging; and 3.16% and 1.45% according to Gradient Boosting."
The emergence of exploit kits is one of the most important developments in modern cybercrime. Much of cyber-security research in the recent years has been devoted towards defending citizens from harm delivered through exploit kits. In this paper, we examine an alternate, counter-offensive strategy towards combating cybercrime launched through exploit kits. Towards this goal, we survey a wide range of 30 real-world exploit kits and analyze a counter-offensive adversarial model against the kits and kit operator. Guided by our analysis, we present a systematic methodology for examining a given kit to determine where vulnerabilities may reside within its server-side implementation. In our experiments, we found over 180 vulnerabilities among 16 exploit kits of those surveyed, and were able to automatically synthesize exploits for infiltrating 6 of them. The results validate our hypothesis that exploit kits largely lack sophistication necessary to resist counter-offensive activities. We then propose the design of EKHUNTER, a system that is capable of automatically detecting the presence of exploit vulnerabilities and deriving laboratory test cases that can compromise both the integrity of a fielded exploit kit, and even the identity of the kit operator.
Victims are often conceptualized as single, human and static entities with certain risk factors that make them more vulnerable and attractive for offenders. This framework is challenged by emerging forms of high-tech cybercrime, such as ransomware, botnets and virtual theft, in which the offender targets a composite of human, technical and virtual entities. This study critically assesses the current theorization of the cyber victim and offers an alternative approach. Drawing on actor-network theory and three empirical case studies, it analyses the cyber victim as a hybrid actor-network consisting of different entities that, together with the offender, make the victimization possible. The proposed concepts of victim composition, delegation and translation enable a more profound understanding of the hybrid and complex process of becoming a high-tech cyber victim. Keywords: cybercrime, cyber victimization, actor-network theory, botnet, ransomware, virtual theft
Recent research demonstrates that those with low self-control have an increased risk of victimization due to involvement in routine activities that place them in close proximity to motivated offenders and decrease their willingness to utilize appropriate guardianship factors. This relationship is significant in predicting physical forms of victimization, though few studies have considered how this may account for property offenses, particularly forms of cybercrime which may be hidden from victims. This article explores the extent to which personal characteristics and user behaviors affect the probability of malicious software infections, a serious form of cybercrime, using the integrated routine activities and self-control theory of victimization. Using a nationally representative sample of adults in the Netherlands, this analysis found time spent on specific computer activities (e.g., downloading files) as well as low self-control increase indications of malware infection, while protection of wireless networks seems effective in preventing them.
"Fraud has existed long before the advent of modern technology; however, we can increasingly observe how this profit-driven enterprise is entering the cyberspace. Our paper focuses on a case study of two scam schemes targeting international students at Penn State. The scams have been perpetrated in either a physical (i.e., phone scam) or online (i.e., Craigslist scam) form. However, this dichotomy becomes blurry when examining the phone scams more closely since they often employ cyber elements (e.g., phone spoofing, requests of electronic payment) to mask the scammer's tracks and identity. Our study aims to better understand the nature of the scams and how international students contextualize their scam experiences. We place particular emphasis on investigating what students' decision-making processes are behind filing a report about their scam experiences. We also explore the predominantly used reporting avenues by those international students who filed reports. In the first part of our study, we present a qualitative analysis of Penn State campus police reports of scam incidents covering three years of data (2014-2016). Aside from being able to understand the prevalence and details of the experienced scams, the analysis of the data also helps to unpack the motivations behind why international students file reports to entities like campus police particularly in the event that an inchoate crime was experienced. Furthermore, working with the data lays the groundwork for the second half of our study, a 16-person in-depth interview series with international students who experienced a scam while studying at Penn State. The results of our case study will show the fundamental impact of increased awareness in preventing international students from falling victim to the scams they encountered. However, opportunities still remain in terms of effectively increasing knowledge about how such incidents can be officially reported to law enforcement and how currently existing cybercrime reporting mechanisms can be improved to further bolster cybercrime reporting to take place."
Despite the enactment of the Nigerian Cybercrime Act in 2015, cyber fraud still remains largely pervasive among the youths, especially undergraduates. Against this background, this study examined the pathways and motivations for cyber fraud involvement among female undergraduates of selected universities in south-west Nigeria. It adopted the exploratory cum cross-sectional research design. Social learning theory was employed as conceptual framework. Data were exclusively generated through in-depth interviews conducted with 17 female undergraduates selected using the snowball sampling technique. Results showed that female undergraduates got initiated into cyber fraud by their male relatives and associates. Financial gain and peer pressure were the major motivating factors for their involvement in the crime. Cyber fraud was seen by the students to be a source of income for meeting their own personal and relatives' financial needs. A multi-dimensional approach is suggested as a way of effectively dealing with this form of crime.
Cybercrime markets support the development and difusion of new attack technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. Whereas the revenue streams of cyber attackers have been studied multiple times in the literature, no quantitative account currently exists on the economics of attack acquisition and deployment. Yet, this understanding is critical to characterize the production of (traded) exploits, the economy that drives it, and its efects on the overall attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical investigation of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the efects of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected irst-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the trading of the most active attack tools reported by the security industry happens. Our indings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand, cyber-criminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and exploit pricing. We then evaluate the efects of these market variables on likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.
Cyber Crime is an illegal activity in which offender makes use of the smart devices such as computers and other network devices as the primary source in order to gain some profit from the victim by violating the rules. Cyber attacks are persistently rising, detection of cyber crimes and providing preventive measures by manual investigation are often failed to control the cyber attacks. Therefore, machine learning plays a vital role in detecting those cybercrimes. It has the ability to detect and analyze the cyber attack and provides the preventive measures in order to reduce the incarnation of the cyber crimes. Therefore, incorporating machine learning techniques such as classification and clustering into our framework can help to build a cyber crime detection system and prediction of cyber attacks annually. Existing literature in the area of cybercrime offences by feature extraction focuses on several techniques. In this a novel framework for cybercrime offences by feature extractions is proposed. In this proposed framework one can upload any unstructured cyber crime report to generate the structure data through TFID technique. Later this framework can give a report on categorization and resolution of the cyber crime offences (especially ID theft, Hacking and Copyright attacks) by its severity and occurrence. It is achieved by extracting the feature description using text mining algorithms and by using the performance measurements and prediction analysis of cyber crime.
The growing rate of cybercrime has turned into a crucial concern that makes people more afraid of cyberwar than a nuclear weapon and climate change. An alarming awareness level has been observed in this study which is not satisfactory. A significant percentage of the population is unaware of cybersecurity policies and practices. Even the relevant organizations, as well as the government, are not concerned about the issues of cybercrime. A significant variation is essential to enrich the cybersecurity policies and practices. Furthermore, it needs to be monitored and restructured with the pace of time. This pilot study is designed to consider a comprehensive investigation regarding the level of cybercrime awareness amongst Bangladeshi people. The survey has been carried out through both the online and offline responses against a well-prepared questionnaire. Additionally, T-test, mean score and ANOVA tests were accompanied for detailed analysis. Based on this study, it is recommended that the development and implementation of a massive cybersecurity awareness program are urgently required that would immune the citizens from cyber threats.
Current literature widely reports successful uses of social media as a source of information, collaborative and learning tool for students in higher education. Although universities increasingly promote the use of Social Network Services (SNS) little is known about how students use them. Also the adverse effects of social media activity, such as cybercrime victimisation in HE, are under explored. Concerns over informal leisure use of SNS by students leading to cyber victimisation may help explain slow adoption of social media in education. This paper shows, however, that students use SNS in a similar way to those users who are not in education, with more that 60% using SNS for both socialising and gathering information. We find that students are less likely to be victims of cybercrime than non-students suggesting that SNS activity is less risky within the university lifespan. The implications of this study are significant for policy and practice for universities and educational authorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
With the development of internet technology, the era of big data with data explosion has come. As a result, the types and the amount of data that need to be processed in cybercrime investigations are increasing. It is a great challenge to find the clues or evidences of crime from the massive data. The emergence of big data technology has brought new directions for digital forensics investigations. It is of practical significance to integrate big data technology and digital forensics to crack down on cybercrime. This paper proposes a big data forensics framework which describes the process and related technologies. In addition, the challenges to realize this framework have been taken into consideration.
Fraud with online payment services is an ongoing problem, with significant financial-economic and societal impact. One of the main modus operandi is financial malware that compromises consumer and corporate devices, thereby potentially undermining the security of critical financial systems. Recent research into the underground economy has shown that cybercriminals are organised around highly specialised tasks, such as pay-per-install markets for infected machines, malware-as-a-service and money mule recruitment. Setting up a successful financial malware scheme requires the aligning of many moving parts. Analysing how cybercrime groups acquire, combine and align these parts into value chains can greatly benefit from existing insights into the economics of online crime. Using transaction cost economics, this paper illustrates the business model behind financial malware and presents three novel value chains therein. For this purpose, we use a conceptual synthesis of the state-of-the-art of the literature on financial malware, underground markets and (cyber)crime economics, as well as today's banking practice.
Community-oriented policing has shaped law enforcement over the past 30 years, providing innovative strategies to identify and combat crime problems through collaborative community partnerships. The success of community policing strategies in some contexts has led some scholars and police administrators to call for the adoption of these programs in virtual environments to combat cybercrimes. It is unclear how such a program may operate or what factors affect line officer support for their use in the field. Thus, this study examined how community policing support, computer proficiency, and perceptions of the Internet and cybercrime were related to support for online community policing in a sample of officers from two Southeastern cities. The study found that support for community policing in the real world and perceptions of cybercrime severity were the two most consistently significant predictors of support for online community policing. The significance of these findings for policing practice and theory are discussed.
This paper addresses the question whether and to what extent the experience of online hate speech affects victims' sense of security. Studies on hate crime in general show that such crimes are associated with a significantly higher feeling of insecurity, but there is little evidence concerning feeling of insecurity due to online hate speech. Based on a secondary data analysis of a representative population survey in Lower Saxony, Germany, on the topic of cybercrime in 2020 (N = 4,102), we tested three hypotheses regarding the effect of offline and online hate speech on feelings of insecurity. As a result, compared to non-victims, victims of online hate speech exhibit a more pronounced feeling of insecurity outside the Internet, while victims of other forms of cybercrime do not differ in this regard from non-victims. We found no effect for offline hate speech when relevant control variables were included in the statistical model. Possible reasons for this finding are assumed to lie in the characteristics of the phenomenon of online hate speech, for example, because the hateful content spreads uncontrollably on the Internet and reaches its victims even in protected private spheres.
This conference presentation describes a process for developing a multidisciplinary curriculum in cyberscience. The process presented is a broad-based approach designed to support a four-year undergraduate cyberscience curriculum applicable to diverse institutions of higher learning.
This article explores the privacy and security issues associated with large language models (LLMs). It takes a look at nefarious actors' possible use of LLM tools. Also analyzed are behaviors and practices of the developers, operators, and users of such models from privacy and security standpoints.
As a kickoff teaser for next year's ISTAS 2022 conference, Digital and Societal Transformations, this interdisciplinary panel considers the social impact of digital innovations like 5G in the contexts of privacy, security, socio-economic prosperity and cybercrime. The panelists, who are international leaders and experts in privacy, cybersecurity, and technology policy and governance, will discuss and share their concerns on the socio-cultural and economic benefits and challenges of the ongoing digital transformation.
Online underground forums have been widely used by cybercriminals to trade the illicit products, resources and services, which have played a central role in the cybercriminal ecosystem. Unfortunately, due to the number of forums, their size, and the expertise required, it's infeasible to perform manual exploration to understand their behavioral processes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named iDetector to automate the analysis of underground forums for the detection of cybercrime-suspected threads. In iDetector, to detect whether the given threads are cybercrime-suspected threads, we not only analyze the content in the threads, but also utilize the relations among threads, users, replies, and topics. To model this kind of rich semantic relationships (i.e., thread-user, thread-reply, thread-topic, reply-user and reply-topic relations), we introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation, which is capable to be composed of different types of entities and relations. To capture the complex relationships (e.g., two threads are relevant if they were posted by the same user and discussed the same topic), we use a meta-structure based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness over threads. As different meta-structures depict the relatedness over threads at different views, we then build a classifier using Laplacian scores to aggregate different similarities formulated by different meta-structures to make predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use structural HIN to automate underground forum analysis. Comprehensive experiments on real data collections from underground forums (e.g., Hack Forums) are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iDetector in cybercrime-suspected thread detection by comparisons with other alternative methods.
The Internet has been widely adopted by UAE citizens, with one of the highest penetration rates in the world, yet the potential to become a victim of cybercrime is high. A quantitative cross-sectional online survey strategy was adopted to collect the data on cybercrime and cybervictimisation to support the identification of the most appropriate approaches to address cybervictimisation in the UAE. The results indicate the key patterns of cybervictimisation in the UAE as identity fraud, cyberharassment and cyber attack, with impacts mainly on a psychological/ emotional level. Evidence pointed to strong associations between online activity and time spent online and cybervictimisation. There was a significant perception that legislative measures did not sufficiently address cybervictimisation and punitive measures were lenient. Logistic regression analysis indicated likelihood of cybervictimisation was associated with technical guardianship, online behaviour and usage, computer proficiency, time spent online, region of residence and gender. Classification and regression tree analysis identified different patterns indicating user characteristics consisting of security measures and online routine behaviour. The findings support the development of a comprehensive Incident Response Framework (IRF), which is needed to inform legal authorities and victim service provision.
Underground forums are widely used by criminals to buy and sell a host of stolen items, datasets, resources, and criminal services. These forums contain important resources for understanding cybercrime. However, the number of forums, their size, and the domain expertise required to understand the markets makes manual exploration of these forums unscalable. In this work, we propose an automated, top-down approach for analyzing underground forums. Our approach uses natural language processing and machine learning to automatically generate high-level information about underground forums, first identifying posts related to transactions, and then extracting products and prices. We also demonstrate, via a pair of case studies, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to investigate other categories of products and transactions. We use eight distinct forums to assess our tools: Antichat, Blackhat World, Carders, Darkode, Hack Forums, Hell, L33tCrew and Nulled. Our automated approach is fast and accurate, achieving over 80% accuracy in detecting post category, product, and prices.
A sharp distinction between the virtual world and the real world continues but has become less tenable as technology has progressed. This review paper traces some early and recent views on this distinction, and highlights three: cyberscapes, cyberplaces, and code/space. Mobile applications, ubiquitous computing, and cloud data storage serve to blend the real and the virtual in a user-generated cyberspace. Within that space, knowledge production takes place in virtual spaces, as do less benign activities, such as surveillance and cybercrime. Policymakers must react to an increasingly complex environment of spaces in between real and virtual worlds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
In the last decade, the proliferation of machine learning (ML) algorithms and their application on big data sets have benefited many researchers and practitioners in different scientific areas. Consequently, the research in cybercrime and digital forensics has relied on ML techniques and methods for analyzing large quantities of data such as text, graphics, images, videos, and network traffic scans to support criminal investigations. Complete and accurate training data sets are indispensable for efficient and effective machine learning models. An essential part of creating complete and accurate data sets is annotating or labelling data. We present a method for law enforcement agency investigators to annotate and store specific dark web content. Using a design science strategy, we design and develop tools to enable and extend web content annotation. The annotation tool was implemented as a plugin for the Tor browser. It can store web content, thus automatically creating a dataset of dark web data pertinent to criminal investigations. Combined with a central storage management server, enabling annotation sharing and collaboration, and a web scraping program, the dataset becomes multifold, dynamic, and extensive while maintaining the forensic soundness of the data saved and transmitted. To manifest our toolset's fitness of purpose, we used our dataset as training data for ML based classification models. A five cross-fold validation technique was used to evaluate the classifiers, which reported an accuracy score of 85 - 96%. In the concluding sections, we discuss the possible use-cases of the proposed method in real-life cybercrime investigations, along with ethical concerns and future extensions.
Recently, ransomware has earned itself an infamous reputation as a force to reckon with in the cybercrime landscape. However, cybercriminals are adopting other unconventional means to seamlessly attain proceeds of cybercrime with little effort. Cybercriminals are now acquiring cryptocurrencies directly from benign Internet users without the need to extort a ransom from them, as is the case with ransomware. This paper investigates advances in the cryptovirology landscape by examining the state-of-the-art cryptoviral attacks. In our approach, we perform digital autopsy on the malware's source code and execute the different malware variants in a contained sandbox to deduce static and dynamic properties respectively. We examine three cryptoviral attack structures: browser-based crypto mining, memory resident crypto mining and cryptoviral extortion. These attack structures leave a trail of digital forensics evidence when the malware interacts with the file system and generates noise in form of network traffic when communicating with the C2 servers and crypto mining pools. The digital forensics evidence, which essentially are IOCs include network artifacts such as C2 server domains, IPs and cryptographic hash values of the downloaded files apart from the malware hash values. Such evidence can be used as seed into intrusion detection systems for mitigation purposes.
Honeypots and honeynets are common tools for network security and network forensics. The deployment and usage of these tools is affected by a number of the technical and legal issues. It is very important to consider both issues together. Therefore, paper outlines technical aspects of honeynet and discusses the liability of honeypot's and honeynet's administrator. Paper deals with civil and criminal liability. Also paper focuses on cybercrime and liability of attackers.
The prosecution of cybercriminals depends upon the collection of digital evidence. In the United States, a complicated system of constitutional and statutory provisions govern what law enforcement officers can, and cannot, do in collecting digital evidence, either by intercepting communications in transmission or by acquiring data stored on computers, computer servers or other storage media. This article reviews the constraints imposed by the Fourth Amendment and then surveys the complex array of statutory provisions that have arisen to supplement the protections it provides.
Collecting cybercrime evidence on the Internet typically involves reconnaissance and analyses of information extracted. Scouring the Internet, especially the Deep Web, often requires manual effort and is time-consuming. Hence, it is imperative to have an efficient framework for an intelligent tool to gather cyber intel automatically according to programmed directives. In this paper, we present an updated design to our prior threat intelligence hunter. We make use of machine learning for parsing linguistic intel.
"In West Africa, both cyber fraud and cyber policing are mainly about storytelling. Based on fieldwork in the Ghanaian police, this article explores criminal investigations of email scams; it shows how actors rely on, make use of, lose faith in and reinvent stories. Each cyber fraud case can be understood as a series of connected tales, and all involved try to change the direction of the narrative. While the first tale takes place in virtual spaces between continents, the later ones are located in Ghana and are about police work there. The actors' stories both tap into and create social imaginaries, and the involved actors thereby craft conflicting notions of order and disorder. However, not only the fraudsters' stories but also the police officers' and victims' stories are often factually inaccurate and are partly fictional. Ultimately, all actor groups struggle to create believable stories under current conditions."
The purpose of the present study is to contribute to the gap in the literature by investigating the hacking behaviors of adolescents under the age of 18 and the predictors of these behaviors. In order to better understand the predictors of hacking behaviors in young people, we will be utilizing two criminological theories: General Theory of Crime and Social Learning Theory. Using data collected from high school students in a rural county in western North Carolina, results indicated that low self-control and deviant peer association were in fact associated with hacking behaviors of juveniles.
With the rapid advancement of technology in Malaysia, the number of cybercrimes is also increasing. To stop the increase in cybercrimes, everyone, including normal citizens, needs to know how secure they are while using digital appliances. A system is developed to predict the risk of users based on their behaviour when they are online using real-life behavioural data obtained from a private university's 207 undergraduates. Five supervised machine learning methods are being tested which are: Regression Logistics, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayesian Classifier with the aid of a tool, RapidMiner. The algorithms are used to construct, test, and validate three categories of cybercrime threat (Malware, Social Engineering, and Password Attack) predictive models. It was found that KNN model produces the highest accuracy and lowest classification error for all three categories of cybercrime threat. This system is believed to be crucial in alerting users with details of whether the consumer behaviour risk is high or low and what further actions can be taken to increase awareness. This system aims to prevent the rise in cybercrimes by providing a prediction of their risk levels in cybersecurity to encourage them to be more proactive in cybersecurity.
In this research work, we investigate the effects of cybercrime and focus on concerns about cybercrime expansion. Since black-hat hackers are constantly one step ahead of white-hat hackers and exploit new sophisticated hack-tools to intrude to devices and networks to commit cybercrime for different reasons, the utilization of the available emerging technologies can provide better privacy and protection level, while they can be used to combat cybercriminal attacks. This shift to new technologies and methods is regarded to be an urgent necessity today. Therefore, we demonstrate a potential novel security mechanism for Police Authorities, named Artificial Intelligence ANTi-Attack System or simply AIANTAS that aspires to improve the detection rate of cybercriminals and lead to their faster arrest. This model can be integrated into the other National Security defense mechanisms both in Greece and worldwide.
This paper uses the public health framework to address the apparent impact of the coronavirus on the victimization experiences with a specific focus given to those over the age of 50. The bulk of attention is given to fraud victimization, with consideration also given to parent abuse, partner violence, and patient abuse. A review of data from the Federal Trade Commission shows that reports of most types of fraud grew significantly in the first three months of 2020 in comparison to the same time period in 2019. Differences between fraud experiences based on age are considered. Older persons lost much more to fraud than younger persons, and far more in 2020 than 2019. In addition, they reported being targeted more often for certain types of cybercrime (i.e., tech support scams). While devastating to everyone, it is concluded that the coronavirus will potentially have a more significant impact on the financial health of older persons than younger persons. It is concluded that minimizing the consequences of all forms of crimes targeting older adults will be best achieved by using a public health approach.
Cybersecurity is focused on helping the community to make knowledgeable decisions on its adaptation and mitigation. This survey evaluated the level of cybersecurity awareness and discernment amongst university students in Sri Lanka. The study was based on primary data collected through a questionnaire on awareness and the perception of cybersecurity from respondents at universities in Sri Lanka. The results indicated that experience and the level of cybersecurity awareness among university students in Sri Lanka are not significantly low, but there are some knowledge gaps with new threats. Further, the results showed that university students in Sri Lanka were able to identify cybercrime as a threat. These findings necessitate building awareness and developing capacity to improve student's knowledge on the cybersecurity subject especially if universities are to be used as a key focal point in cybersecurity awareness campaigns in Sri Lanka.
This article presents the results of empirical analyses of the use of information technology (IT) by organized crime groups. In particular, it explores how the use of IT affects the processes of origin and growth of criminal networks. The empirical data presented in this article consist of 30 large scale criminal investigations into organized crime, including traditional organized crime, traditional organized crime in which IT is an innovative element, low tech cybercrimes and high tech cybercrimes. Networks involved in cybercrimes or traditional crimes with an innovative IT element can be characterized as a mixture of old school criminals that have a long criminal career, and a limited number of technically skilled members. Furthermore, almost all cases have a local dimension. Also the cybercrime cases. Dutch sellers of drugs on online marketplace, for example, mainly work for customers in the Netherlands and surrounding countries.
Nowadays, the number of malicious attacks on cyber-physical systems is in a continuous growth. Juridical investigation of such cases is a powerful means of fighting against such phenomena. The present paper presents a chain of methods that can be used for collecting incriminating probes regarding possible illegal activities performed in an industrial infrastructure. The chain consists of hardware and software tools needed for collecting, analyzing, filtering and storing relevant information regarding malicious activity. Through this chain of methods, computer system investigators can analyze and identify evidence more efficiently. An integrated system with several analyzers, distributed in distinct geographical locations, proves useful in collecting forensic evidence in cybercrime investigations. The proposed system offers flexibility in deploying and configuring the investigation tools on a distributed infrastructure.
Purpose This exploratory research examined law enforcement officers' attitudes toward the public-private partnerships (PPPs) in policing cyberspace. Particularly, by investigating the predictors of police officers' support for the PPPs, the authors aimed to offer practical implications for maintaining order and responding to illegal activities in the virtual environment. Design/methodology/approach A convenience sample of South Korean police officers was surveyed using a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Findings The findings showed that officer perceptions of the seriousness and the frequency of property cybercrimes, computer proficiency and awareness of a lack of training were positively associated with the support for the PPPs. In addition, years of experience was negatively related to the support for the PPPs. Originality/value Law enforcement officers' perceptions toward public-private cooperation in combatting cybercrime have never been examined. This research fills the gap by exploring the predictors of officer support for cross-sectoral partnerships within the framework of nodal governance security in the cultural context of South Korea.
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the reporting of cybercrime in Australia, specifically the reporting of fraud. Design/methodology/approach - Using an evaluation of the (former) Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN), this paper provides a commentary on the report findings, including both positive and negative aspects of the reporting mechanism. Findings - The paper focuses on three key challenges that were identified in the evaluation: victim satisfaction; quality of data; and unintended consequences. Each of these topics is outlined and located within a broader context to better understand the evaluation findings. Research limitations/implications - This viewpoint paper is a commentary based upon an evaluation of ACORN which itself has several limitations of its methodology. Despite this, the evaluation provides important insights into the challenges that currently exist with the online reporting of fraud offences both in Australia, and worldwide. Practical implications - This paper emphasises the structural and systemic issues that exist for the reporting of fraud in Australia. It therefore warns against placing blame exclusively on police agencies as responsible for these results. Instead, it advocates the need for society to take a more coordinated and collaborative approach to the policing of fraud, which includes law enforcement, government and industry partners. Social implications - The paper documents some of the underlying reasons for additional trauma and harm experienced by victims of fraud in their efforts to report their incident and receive what they perceive to be an appropriate criminal justice response. These must be acknowledged in order to make the required change. Originality/value - This paper is a commentary and reflection on the current way in which fraud is reported in Australia. It points to a need to rethink this approach in some key areas. It highlights the critical need for an education campaign to dispel some of the myths that exist in relation to realistic police responses to fraud, and also calls for the need to consider alternatives to the exclusively online system currently in operation, as well as larger questions about notions of justice and appropriate responses to fraud victims."
By January 2021, the number of Internet users amounted to 4.7 billion, while the social media audience hit the 4.2 billion mark. Two-thirds of the world's population use mobile phones daily. The average Internet user spends 42% of his time in the global network. These figures prove convincingly that the Internet has become an integral part of human life. However, man's using the Internet involves increasingly the risk of cybercrime perpetrated against the user. The purpose of the research is to assess the potential of Big Data technologies to combat cyber fraud as a form of cybercrime. The study used the statistical data provided by the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation and the publications in scientific journals. The methodological basis of the research is represented by a combination of general scientific and special scientific methods, with analysis, statistical method and systemic approach being the major tools. It was found in the course of the research that fraud constitutes the majority of crimes on the Internet. To counteract it, mobile operators and banks use anti-fraud techniques based on Big Data analysis. The paper provides an overview of services and programmes based on artificial intelligence and Big Data technologies, aimed at detecting and preventing telephone and internet fraud, used by law enforcement agencies in various countries. The paper concludes that Big Data has changed the vector of law enforcement activity from reactive to proactive.
In this work we present technical profiles for computer and Internet user. These profiles are made taking in account academic formation from high school to undergraduate studies in Mexico. We have analyzed high school schedules from the most important Mexican Universities. We made a similar task with undergraduate studies considering engineering, social and humanistic careers and also medical and health studies. We consider to do this work technical training, international standards about Informatics Security, Data Centers installation and operation standards. We propose four profiles including knowledge, competence for computer and Internet users to improve the Informatics Security and to prevent risks about cybercrime.
Like most criminological research, much of the research on hacking has predominantly focused upon the Northern Metropolis. As a result, there is a lack of focus on cybercrime within the Global South, particularly on illegal intrusions into computer systems, more colloquially known as hacking. This article provides a critical overview of hacking in the Global South, highlighting the role of strain in this offending behaviour. In particular, the authors note the role of Australian, American, and Taiwanese immigration policies that act to block offenders' transitions from illicit hacking to legitimate employment in technological hubs outside of the Global South. To address these blocked opportunities, this article suggests the use of innovative justice paradigms, particularly restorative justice and regulatory self-enforcement, that respond to innovation-based cybercrime while also facilitating offender movement into white hat employment, even in cases of technology-facilitated sexual violence.
This paper deals with one of the controversial topics in the Criminal Code, namely the moral element of the crime, known as the criminal intent or the intention of committing the crime, for a range of crimes of great importance and widespread, namely cyber crimes. The study of the moral element of these crimes raises the importance of being related to the intent and will of the offender, which raises controversy, difficulties and problems, both in terms of forms of criminal intent on the one hand, and in terms of the process of proof in the electronic environment on the other. Therefore, the researchers dealt with this topic to identify those problems related to the moral element in two topics: The first topic deals with the problems of the general model (general purpose) of the moral element in cybercrime. The second topic concerns the forms of moral element in cybercrime. The study concluded a number of conclusions and recommendations related to this subject.
Phishing is among the most concerning issues in a constantly changing world. The increasing use of the Internet has led to a new way of stealing data, known as cybercrime. Cybercrime refers to stealing private information and violating privacy through computers. The primary technique used is phishing. Phishing via URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) is one of the most common types, and its primary goal is to steal the data from the user when the user accesses the malicious website. Detecting a malicious URL is a significant challenge. This work aims to provide a solution for detecting such websites with the help of machine learning algorithms focused on the behaviors and qualities of the suggested URL. The web security community has created blacklisting services to identify malicious websites. A variety of methods, such as manual reporting, and site analysis heuristics are used to create these blacklists. Due to their recentness, lack of evaluation, or incorrect evaluation, many malicious websites inadvertently escape blacklisting. To create a machine learning model for detecting whether a URL is malicious or not, algorithms such as Random Forests, Decision Trees, Light GBM, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used. Extracting features is the first step, and applying the model is the next step.
Over the past decade, considerable research effort has been devoted to articulating and measuring the various ways through which cyber crime impacts overall society. The large volume of literature on the topic contains few attempts to produce estimates of the financial impact of specific cyber incidents and little agreement on how to derive such estimates. An important substrata of this literature focuses on placing a monetary value on the costs of cyber crime but little is known about the long-term economic impact to society. In this article, we first assess the shortcomings of existing cost estimates and focus on the relevant issues pertinent to the feasibility of deriving valid and useful estimates beyond cost-benefit analyses. Following a mixed top-down/bottom-up methodology, we propose a theoretical framework to systematically identify the short and long-term impacts of cyber crime both at the agent and societal level. This framework serves as the foundation to assess the economic consequences of cyber crime beyond monetary costs by focusing on the impact on economic growth.
Underground forums are used to discuss and organise cybercrime (as well as more conventional social activities). These forums are also commonly used for exchanging various digital currencies, either gained through the profits of crime or through less controversial means. Understanding the link between discussions of illicit behaviour and currency exchange can provide insights to identify money laundering and other parts of the cybercrime supply chain. In this paper we use natural language processing to classify posts from HackForums by crime type over a period of more than 10 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of classification has been used for this large forum dataset. Although the majority of conversations in the forum were identified as relating to non-criminal discussions, we concentrate on the types of crimes being discussed by those exchanging currencies. We find the most popular topics are related to trading credentials and bots and malware. PayPal was one of the most widely advertised digital currencies and we observe significant displacement from Liberty Reserve to Bitcoin after the former was taken down in 2013. Rather than an explicit 'cashing out' mechanism, in which cryptocurrencies gained through crime flow into state-backed fiat currencies, we instead see a circulation of capital between different forms, as cash is held and then cashed back and forward according to movements in the wider currency market. We continue our examination of discussions of cryptocurrencies and explore how the underground market has reacted to new opportunities, with a qualitative case study about Facebook's putative 'Diem' coin. We find that while most discussions are related to the technical details and potential investment opportunities, some potential cybercrime use-cases are raised.
"Criminal jurisdiction and prosecution in cyberspace has become a universal problem due to the difficulty of identifying the crime scene and tracking the criminal from a digital footprint. Globally, we are experiencing unprecedented cyberspace criminal activity comprising terrorism, espionage, extortion schemes, global financial system attacks, human trafficking, and ransomware. Criminal activity does not just focus on taking the cyber network hostage; it could disrupt life-saving medical equipment, the aviation industry, or power grids that impact essential services to citizens around the globe. Most research to date has been focused on the enactment of criminal legislation, investigative tools, and prosecution of cybercrimes, but very little attention has been given to post-conviction matters such as sentencing, deterrence or victim impact. The purpose of this research is to survey the cybercrime laws both in the United States and the European Union, and provide a comparative analysis of the variation in these laws and recommendations for improvement. The question of whether the punishment is tailored to fit the crime has raised interest from a national and international perspective due not only to the diversity of cybercrime laws, but the deterrent impact from the penalty or punishment that can be imposed in a case. Some scholars and experts find the sanctions, penalties and punishments too severe, while others argue the law does not go far enough to punish the cybercriminal. The sanctions and punishment for recent high profile cybercriminal activity will be analyzed. Through empirical research the paper identifies the criminal frameworks of selected countries and provides examples of model criminal cyber laws that include the penalties most important in combatting and deterring criminals in cyberspace."
The inception of blockchain catapulted the development of innovative use cases utilizing the trustless, decentralized environment, empowered by cryptocurrencies. The envisaged benefits of the technology includes the divisible nature of a cryptocurrency, that can facilitate payments in fractions of a cent, enabling micropayments through the blockchain. Micropayments are a critical tool to enable financial inclusion and to aid in global poverty alleviation. The paper conducts a study on the economic impact of blockchain-based micropayment systems, emphasizing their significance for socioeconomic benefit and financial inclusion. The paper also highlights the contribution of blockchain-based micropayments to the cybercrime economy, indicating the critical need of economic regulations to curtail the growing threat posed by the digital payment mechanism.
Although numerous studies on cybercrime have been undertaken, very little is known about the BEC scam and its effects on economic sustainability in Nigeria. Using data collected via various methods, this study examines the implications of the BEC scam as cyber victimization on the economic infrastructure of corporate organizations in Cross River State, Nigeria. A specifically structured questionnaire and an in-depth interview with staff (n = 1087) was conducted and the data received were analyzed using descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and content analysis. Findings revealed that BEC victimization is increasing, and has adversely affected such corporate organizations as banks, telecommunications firms, and manufacturing companies. The organization one works for is an important factor in determining one's vulnerability to BEC scamming. Therefore, a multilateral cybersecurity and cyber-intelligence relationship between the various corporations and government departments is necessary for adequate protection of critical infrastructures. This multi-sectoral approach to cyber-law enforcement requires the installation of uncompromised internal physical and digital access control in order to strengthen targets. This demands robust organizational cyberspace surveillance to complement the existing government counter-cybercrime implementations.
The article is of interest to managers and scientists at all levels who deal with combating cyber threats. The study analyzed the security environment and confirmed the rapid growth of malware and cyberattacks. The stages of development of cybercrime are analyzed, and the most significant cyberattacks that have taken place in recent years are identified. Statistics on the number of cyberattacks and their devastating impact on economies are presented. A brief description of the available types of malware and the algorithm of unauthorised entry of cyber attackers into the system is given. The article offers a variant of developing the concept of cybersecurity, defines the range of participants in ensuring the organisation's cybersecurity, and formulates an algorithm for its development and operation.
By January 2021, the number of Internet users amounted to 4.7 billion, while the social media audience hit the 4.2 billion mark. Two-thirds of the world's population use mobile phones daily. The average Internet user spends 42% of his time in the global network. These figures prove convincingly that the Internet has become an integral part of human life. However, man's using the Internet involves increasingly the risk of cybercrime perpetrated against the user. The purpose of the research is to assess the potential of Big Data technologies to combat cyber fraud as a form of cybercrime. The study used the statistical data provided by the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation and the publications in scientific journals. The methodological basis of the research is represented by a combination of general scientific and special scientific methods, with analysis, statistical method and systemic approach being the major tools. It was found in the course of the research that fraud constitutes the majority of crimes on the Internet. To counteract it, mobile operators and banks use anti-fraud techniques based on Big Data analysis. The paper provides an overview of services and programmes based on artificial intelligence and Big Data technologies, aimed at detecting and preventing telephone and internet fraud, used by law enforcement agencies in various countries. The paper concludes that Big Data has changed the vector of law enforcement activity from reactive to proactive.
This study examines the functionality and propagation patterns of computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses detected during a 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2004. Using data obtained from threat reports prepared by a major vendor of computer security products, the authors find that these unique forms of cybercrime warrant general concern but that their overall threat to corporate, government, and end computer users thus far has been exaggerated. The authors conclude that greater attention must be paid to the role of the computer user in the spread of viruses and other malicious software and to the small handful of chronic offenders who contribute disproportionately to the problem.
Researchers analyze underground forums to study abuse and cybercrime activities. Due to the size of the forums and the domain expertise required to identify criminal discussions, most approaches employ supervised machine learning techniques to automatically classify the posts of interest. Human annotation is costly. How to select samples to annotate that account for the structure of the forum? We present a methodology to generate stratified samples based on information about the centrality properties of the population and evaluate classifier performance. We observe that by employing a sample obtained from a uniform distribution of the post degree centrality metric, we maintain the same level of precision but significantly increase the recall (+30%) compared to a sample whose distribution is respecting the population stratification. We find that classifiers trained with similar samples disagree on the classification of criminal activities up to 33% of the time when deployed on the entire forum.
Online crimes such as frauds have grown substantially in volume over the last 20 years, with the associated changes in technology such as the internet and use of email. The state response through the police has lagged in many countries with law enforcement often struggling to cope with the volume and new challenges of such crimes. Private policing has traditionally filled the gap through commercial forms where clients are willing to pay through to voluntary actions such as vigilantism. Cybercrime has not escaped such outcomes with a growing voluntary sector responding to such crimes. In doing so there have been a wide range of such responses ranging from vigilantism through to state supported initiatives. This paper seeks to chart this voluntary response and in doing so conceptulizes it through three waves of voluntarism.
Modern societies across the globe rely more on technology every day. While such advances have made some aspects of life easier, there is an increasing risk of cybercrime that can jeopardize national security and economic vitality. The purpose of this study is to build cybercriminal profiles in order to better predict future cyber-threats and create a more targeted prevention strategy for South Korea. The FBI's criminal profiling analysis is employed. Data were derived from court records and news media documents reporting computer hacking incidents in South Korea between 2010 and 2019. Our analysis shows that there are differences in motivations, attack methods, and accomplices in computer hacking incidents between youth and adult hackers. Policy implications are discussed.
Detecting electronic crimes is a big challenge as they are tainted with a large number of imperfections such as imprecision and uncertainty. For this reason, we must choose a perfect tool to detect cybercrime taking place in an uncertain environment. In this paper, we are proposing a high-level data fusion approach based on evidence theory (Dempster-Shafer theory) which aims at improving the reliability of cybercrimes detection process using a more improved decision consisting in merging complementary decisions from two independent classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural network (ANN) in an uncertain environment. In fact, the retained approach is characterized by its capability to overcome the uncertain data nature.
Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020 have led to lockdowns and social distancing in most countries around the world, with a shift from the traditional work environment to virtual one. Employees have been encouraged to work from home where possible to slow down the viral infection. The massive increase in the volume of professional activities executed online has posed a new context for cybercrime, with the increase in the number of emails and phishing websites. Phishing attacks have been broadened and extended through years of pandemics COVID-19. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting phishing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) applying the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a fast and highly accurate phishing classifier system. Comparative analysis of the GRU classification system indicates better accuracy (98.30%) than other classifier systems.
The intensity of cyberattacks aimed at information resources of Polish organisations is growing. Polish entrepreneurs are concerned about hacking attacks and cybercrime prevalent in the contemporary digital world. Tools traditionally applied in the cybersecurity area are becoming insufficient in ensuring protection against ever more sophisticated types of cyberattacks. Therefore, it seems reasonable to search for new solutions that can support organisations in combating cyberthreats. One of them can be application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the domain of information and data management in Polish organisations. These solutions offer new capacities that can be successfully utilised for the benefit of organisations that wish to secure themselves against growing occurrences of cyberattacks. Yet, the knowledge of Polish organisations pertaining to possibility of applying AI in the cybersecurity area is relatively low. This needs to be changed as the application of AI in this domain is no longer an option but a necessity.
The Great Firewall of China (GFW) has become a familiar trope in information security circles. China is comparatively shut off from the rest of the Internet, with extensive censorship and blocking of websites, especially those hosted outside China. The Chinese public use a variety of methods to circumvent the extensive online censorship practised by the Chinese state. In scaling the Great Firewall, these ordinary users of the Internet now make use of so-called airport services which allow tunnelling through to censored websites. This has resulted in the emergence of both an illicit ecosystem of censorship circumvention providers and a population of scammers who set up fake or unreliable services to con these would-be everyday Internet freedom enthusiasts. We have discovered, through scraping the public chat channels used by airport providers, that this anti-censorship ecosystem is beginning to develop highly organised methods of self-policing, making co-ordinated use of technicques associated with malicious cybercrime to force these scammers offline and promote a healthy market. While so-called booter services - websites where users can purchase Denial of Service attacks for a small fee - have generally been used for malicious purposes, amusement, protest, or extortion, our research suggests that in the Chinese censorship circumvention market they are being used for internal policing.
The threat of attacks enabled by malicious software, or programs used to compromise computer systems and steal information, has increased dramatically over the last two decades. There has, however, been little research considering the correlates of malware infection victimization. Thus, this study attempts to refine the existing literature on malware victimization using multiple measures for the presence of an infection and a Routine Activities framework to identify the correlates of infection in a sample of students, faculty, and staff at a southeastern university. The implications of this study for criminological theory and cybercrime research are discussed in detail.
The 2013 Norton Cyber Security reports reveal that South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims in the word - only surpassed by China and Russia. This paper critically reviews one area, the cyber security of small companies, which plays a significant role in putting SA is in this unenviable position, and suggests a plan of action to address the identified area. It is well reported that small companies are increasingly becoming major targets for cyber criminals. Major reasons for this are that small companies do not have the expert security knowledge and often cannot afford to get their own cyber security house in order. Compromising the cyber security measures of small companies in SA can have a crucial impact on the general cyber security of SA as a whole. This paper will investigate this aspect with the main objective of presenting a Plan of Action to improve the situation.
Cyberstalking has many new manifestations with the opportunities offered by modern technology. It is a growing issue that presents significant distress to its victims. This type of crime presents difficulty to computer forensic investigators in large amounts of digital evidence accumulated over time and in offender apprehension. There is currently little research in the profiling the cyberstalker through a digital investigation. However, techniques employed for dead-end offline investigations, including criminal profiling are also be applied to cybercrime. This research focuses on developing a profiling methodology for profiling the cyberstalker. We adopted the Behavioural Evidence Analysis methodology to the digital investigation process and attempted to construct our profiling methodology. The methodology was evaluated by using a simulation of stalking behaviours to produce a technical, as well as a criminal profile. The aim of this work is to provide a starting point on the profiling of the cyberstalker. The investigators could then proceed with informed assumptions about the offender, according to his digital traces and also achieve reduced time for the digital investigation.
Victim selection has been thoroughly modelled mathematically in the biological realm. However, this methodology has not been adequately applied in the cybersecurity realm. There has been some application of biological mathematical modelling to counter terrorism, criminology, and cyber security. These existing applications demonstrate the applicability of such models to specific cyber issues. What is currently lacking, and what is explored in this current paper, is application of such mathematics to victim selection in cybercrimes. Such an application of mathematics to cyber crime not only improves analysis of the crime in question but can also assist in investigation. If prey selection is better understood, then finding additional victims of a threat actor can be facilitated. Furthermore, probabilistic prediction of likely victims can also be achieved. This paper outlines a process for applying differential equations from biological predator-prey relationships to cybercrime.
The Isis toolkit offers the sophisticated capabilities required to analyze digital personas and provide investigators with clues to the identity of the individual or group hiding behind one or more personas.
Phishingis a fraudulent process and a form of cybercrime where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information for malicious use. A phisher uses social engineering and technical deception to fetch private information from the web user. Previous Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been used to detect whether URLs are valid, or invalid. The purpose of this work is to detect, or predict, the three stages of Phishing URLs starting with valid, not enough info and invalid URLs. We will investigate different potential models that are trained by Machine Learning algorithms and find out which of these models has better accuracy.
Currently, about half of all global enterprises are adopting and using some form of cloud computing services. In cloud computing, potential digital evidence is distributed across multiple isolated virtual machine instances. Investigating deleted or inactive virtual instances of a cloud is a challenge to digital forensics, and the traditional methods of digital forensics are inadequate to address such digital forensic investigation. Users of the public cloud (whether a potential victim of a cyberattack, a cybercriminal or a digital forensic investigator) inherently communicate using natural human language in the form of sentences and semantics in document messaging such as texts, emails or instant messages. Consequently, natural human language interaction provides a unique identifier for cloud users. This study leverages the natural human language as an identifier to develop a novel digital forensic readiness (DFR) framework for cloud computing to detect cybercrime. The DFR framework comprises the integration of natural language processing techniques in designing a process that mimics a near real-time approach towards cybercrime detection in a cloud environment. Natural language understanding techniques are used to analyse textdata of users in the public cloud and textdata of reported cybercrimes to develop a DFR framework. In the preliminary formation of the DFR framework, the output shows that cybercrime attacks that are in progress in the form of textdata such as online documents, instant messages or emails within an organizational cloud domain can be identified, and potentially investigated swiftly, using the unique signature of users as identifiers. When adopted, the proposed DFR framework can minimize the time lapses in incident identification and reduce the subsequent investigation time of cybercrimes in the public cloud domain.
Today's technological developments have resulted in the emergence of various new crimes threatening the international community. In recent decades, there have been various forms of cybercrimes targeted at the communication networks and defense systems of countries by other countries, known as cyher warfare. Unfortunately, international law has not specified this as a crime, but its impact has caused violations of sovereignty and disruption of national security, resulting in material loss, breakdown of communication networks and obstruction of social and public services based on the hamlet, such as what happened in Estonia in 2007. This article is a normative study that analyzes the elements of cybercrime relating to threats to a country's security. The modification of the cybercrime concept is necessary to designate cybercrimes as crimes of aggression amid technological development to maintain stability in the international community.
This article uses the Convention on Cybercrime as a case study to illustrate the functional integration of international law into diverse national legal systems through the paradigm of treaty harmonization. Nations control the impact of international regulation on domestic business interests by implementing legislation to preserve fundamental rights. Thus, the sovereignty-based legal harmonization model better explains the baseline characteristics of national sovereignty while recognizing that global cooperation in business is a necessary and positive feature of multilateralism. Critics dismiss sovereignty as irrelevant, claiming instead that a new world order has emerged in its place. That kind of deconstructionist talk typically injects fear of multilateralism into the global business community. However, the premise is flawed because it ignores the actual mechanics of treaty accession and the synergy between international law and commerce in the global legal environment.

Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information to be encrypted in such a way that decryption becomes a mechanical operation that does not require a computer. In this paper, we intend to study the different application areas of Visual Cryptography. Visual Cryptography is a wide area of research used in data hiding, securing images, color imaging, multimedia and other such fields. Visual Cryptography comes in the field of data hiding used in cybercrime, file formats etc. This paper focuses on the application areas of visual cryptography from four different research papers/journals which talk about the most important application areas of visual cryptography.
There has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices to conduct online business transactions by ordinary people across the globe. Currently, commercial banks and retail stores are all encouraging their customers to do most of the transactions through online channels. The current types of mobile devices provide such easy access and convenience for consumers. However, there are risks associated with these new cyberspace tools. The ordinary customers who unwittingly utilize this cyberspace are prone to cyber-attacks conducted by the ever alert and ruthless cyber criminals. The 2013 Norton Report on cybercrime puts South Africa on number 3 (at 73%) behind China (at 77%) and Russia (at 85%) in terms of the number of cybercrime victims. The study was conducted in 24 countries involving about 13,022 online adults aged between 18 and 64. These figures indicate that cybercrime is a real problem in South Africa. Cyber criminals always have mechanisms of getting easy access to unprotected data that these ordinary people transmit or store on their mobile devices. The criminals use the data for unorthodox activities such unauthorized bank debits. SD cards can either be removed from these devices or accessed through Bluetooth without the users' knowledge and the data can be used for criminal activities. In these difficult financial times, mobile device users easily fall victims to cyber criminals through many ways such as phishing and spoofing. The unsuspecting mobile device users oblige by divulging their personal and banking details to cyber criminals. Cyber criminals are difficult to track and their network is so complicated to untangle and under these circumstances business organizations cannot guarantee their customers with complete security. Therefore, ordinary mobile device users frequently fall prey to the cyber criminals and lose a lot of data, information and money. Some users have, however, become aware of the dangers of the cyberspace in which they use their mobile devices and seem to be taking precautionary measures to protect themselves against such criminal activities. This paper reports on a case study which was carried out in Thohoyandou area with ordinary users of mobile devices. The paper examines the prevalence of cybercrimes in Thohoyandou and the mechanism that users put in place to counter such crimes. Lastly the paper proposes some strategies that users could use to protect themselves against these malicious activities.
The rampant absorption of Bitcoin as a cryptographic currency, along with rising cybercrime activities, warrants utilization of anomaly detection to identify potential fraud. Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in data mining since most outlying points contain crucial information for further investigation. In the financial world which the Bitcoin network is part of by default, anomaly detection amounts to fraud detection. This paper investigates the use of trimmed k-means, that is capable of simultaneous clustering of objects and fraud detection in a multivariate setup, to detect fraudulent activity in Bitcoin transactions. The proposed approach detects more fraudulent transactions than similar studies or reports on the same dataset.
The innovative potential of blockchain technology proves to be convenient and useful in different sectors, but these opportunities may also be disruptive and create challenges. This paper investigates technical, risk and security related challenges of blockchain. The use of this technology is viewed in light of financial crime that pose a threat to security on national and international level as well. Firstly, elements of blockchain technology and the reasons they really matter are explained. Secondly, we focus on national security and how is it affected by the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. Thirdly, we elaborate on the lack of standards and mechanisms in connection with illegal activities, particularly money-laundering and financing terrorism. Finally, we suggest the use of fuzzy methods for security analysis and testing, and compatibility with GDPR for better protection of the recorded data in chain. We conclude that a collaboration of responsible entities in different sectors is needed as well as the investigation of potential ways in which actors can exploit further applications. The convergence of terrorism and cybercrime should be considered, and the necessary preventive actions taken.
One of the areas of cooperation among the BRICS countries is tackling the misuse of information and communication technologies for criminal activities. Each year, the number of cybercrimes continues to grow. Furthermore, the criminal regulation of cybercrimes in each country differs. This article aims to identify the features of criminal liability for cybercrimes in the BRICS countries and offer potential solutions for developing joint legislation initiatives. The primary focus of this discussion is on cybercrime provisions that can be found in the legal acts of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian South Africa. The main finding of this research is that the criminal law of each country contains different corpus delicti for dealing with crimes committed in cyberspace. There are also differing conceptions of what constitutes cybercrime. The author proposes the enactment of a common document for the BRICS countries that would contain a shared understanding of cybercrimes as well as the various types of cybercrimes. It is possible to divide cybercrimes into two categories: special cybercrimes committed in the field of computer information and general criminal cybercrimes executed using information technology to commit any other common criminal offences. The results of this research can be used to study the problems of criminal responsibility for cybercrimes in the BRICS countries as well as analyze the ways in which the rules under consideration are actually applied in practice.
Research on delinquency reduction often highlights the importance of identifying and sanctioning antisocial and illegal activities so as to reduce the likelihood of future offending. The rise of digital technology complicates the process of detecting cybercrimes and technology enabled offenses, as individuals can use devices from anywhere to engage in various harmful activities that may appear benign to an observer. Despite the growth of cybercrime research, limited studies have examined the extent to which technology enabled offenses are detected, or the behavioral and attitudinal factors associated with being unobserved or caught for one's actions. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by estimating a multinomial regression model for self-reported computer hacking behavior and the likelihood of those actions being detected in a large international sample of juveniles (N = 51,059). The findings demonstrate significant differences between youth who hack without detection compared to those who are caught. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of cybercrime and its relationship to traditional delinquency are explored in depth.
In recent years, the advances in computer hardware and mobile phones have finally met the demand of high-quality Virtual reality (VR) rendering. This has allowed VR simulator training to be extended into new and exciting fields. One of these new-found areas is Crime scene investigative training for inexperienced police officers. It frees the inexperienced officers from the danger of damaging actual crime scenes during their training. The project aims at creating a technical prototype to prepare for making the current existing desktop based Virtual Crime Scene Simulator work in immersive VR. This demonstration paper reports on the implementation and design of this prototype
Online crime and victimization are widespread, and cyber-criminologists have made significant progress in understanding the extent and nature of many forms of cybercrime. Recurring online victimization, however, has been comparatively unexplored. Using self-report survey data collected from 541 college women, the current study seeks to examine various forms of repeated online victimization, including unwanted sexual advances, harassment, and unsolicited contacts. Specifically, the current study explores how individual characteristics, situational factors, and behavioral routines are associated with repeat online victimization. The findings revealed that behavioral routines related to the hookup culture had the most explanatory power in understanding the repeat online victimization of college women. These findings provide guidance for prevention, policy, and research.
The Peep attack is a variant application of a Botnet. This paper proposes a forensic procedure to analyze the attack behavior and explains how to carry out a computer crime investigation. We also discuss the well-known Botnets engaged in the execution of a Peep attack. In our paper, we describe a Peep attack on the Internet as the paradigm of how a cyber-investigator needs to act in the case of a Cybercrime. When cyber detectives prepare to investigate a break in cyber security, there are some issues they must keep in mind and face up to. It is crucial to swiftly preserve digital evidence and conduct forensic analysis that any useful evidence is seized soon after the cybercrime has been committed. Furthermore, there are two phases of digital forensic analysis to retrieve useful evidence when facing a cybercrime attack in our scheme. One phase observes the Internet attack action, and the other one introduces how to investigate each case in on-line analysis of sniffing packets and off-line examination of abnormal files. We believe that this analysis model is workable for any other form of Botnets presently being used. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
In this paper, a network model is developed in which three playersa profit-maximizing provider of cloud computing services, its consumers, and a hackersequentially choose their strategies. Several scenarios with different levels of data security and public prosecution of the hacker are analyzed. Especially for the case when no security measurements are available, a firm's strategy to limit the network size in order to render hacking unattractive is discussed in detail. Finally, policy implications are given implying better international cooperation of the law enforcement authorities.
As the use of the internet is expanding, crimes committed on the internet are also increasing. The means through which fraudsters carry out their schemes are widely known. The negative impacts arising from the activities of internet fraudsters are felt globally. Yet little is understood about the thinking patterns that allow perpetrators to carry on with such crimes. This may also explain why interventions are scarce. In this study, we interviewed 12 male youngsters who are actively engaged in internet fraud activities (11 in the community and 1 in prison custody) in Nigeria. The aim was to identify pro-criminal attitudes and cognitions that are supportive of perpetrating internet fraud. Thematic analysis was used to unpack findings from the interview transcripts. We found that peers were commonly identified to play a role in introducing youths to the crime. There was also tacit support from communities and families. Pro-criminal cognitions such as neutralization, entitlement, minimization, rationalizations, and dehumanization were found in the narratives of the youngsters. Interestingly, youngsters often rationalized and justified their actions using socio-political/socio-historical antecedents, a position we found was popular in the cybercrime space, especially in Nigeria. Our findings have implications for the designing and implementation of rehabilitation intervention for internet fraudsters.
The internet has brought both benefits and risks for academia. Predatory publishing and conferences are well-known, and less common academic cybercrime has also been identified, such as fraudulent conferences and journal hijacking. This study aimed to explore one further possible method for deceiving academics, namely, fraudulent accounts on social media. The study focused on two easily exploitable gaps in journals' social media engagement: whether journals have accounts on the most common social media platforms and whether journals use the same username across all their accounts. Evidence of fraudulent social media accounts was also sought. Drawing from a sample of 50 journals, the results indicate that many journals do not use social media, journals often use multiple usernames and fewer than half the accounts were officially verified. Some apparently fraudulent activity was found, but this was notably limited in scope and appeared to be politically rather than economically oriented. Further potential for deception was evident in accounts unaffiliated with a journal but registered with the journal's usernames and in the opportunity to create new social media accounts with journals' usernames. Journals are recommended to recognize this threat and some possible countermeasures are suggested.
This article examines two contrasting approaches to the governance of police investigations for ensuring that cybercrime-policing is lawful and ethical. The Netherlands has a national police force working under the direction of an equally centralised prosecution service according to specific laws on the use of special powers of surveillance, with evidence tested judicially when added incrementally to the case file. Theoretically, the process of adapting to the novel features of cybercrime policing should be much easier than within the much more fragmented policing structure in England and Wales, where unreliable evidence is challengeable only at the trial stage and the laws governing police action are equally fragmented. The Dutch police, however, have not found it easy to adapt concepts of covert policing developed in the 1990's to their online investigative activities, despite the existence of comparatively detailed guidance and case law for undercover policing in the 'real' world. In the UK, the police seem unsure which requirements and concepts actually apply to their different on-line-investigations. More generally, it is concluded that legal comparisons of the kind undertaken in this article can identify general bottlenecks and barriers to adapting to the cyber environment, but such analysis cannot identify best practices that are readily transferable from one country to another. Legal transplants are a potentially hazardous undertaking because any practices and policies that work successfully will do so because they are necessarily compliant with the underlying systemic legal-cultural factors that make each legal system unique. Indeed, we make no attempt to identify best practices, other than to remark that the centralised nature of Dutch policing seems to afford some advantage, although, for historical and legal-cultural reasons, centralisation is unlikely to be an option for the UK police forces
"The benefits of resorting to the cloud, as an efficient way to provide services, have long been recognised in the academic and industrial literature. However, as more and more companies are beginning to embrace the trend, it has also become clearer that the model offers unprecedented opportunities to cybercriminals: either by enabling them to compromise a myriad of services in a single shot or by allowing cyber-criminals to amplify their capabilities through a leverage of the technology offered by the cloud. This paper highlights the importance of an informed choice of a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in minimising one's exposure to the insecurity of a cloud context. The paper proposes a well-defined approach, known as the Complete-Auditable-Reportable or C.A.RE, as a way to minimise one's exposure to the insecurity we live within the cloud. The C.A.RE approach helps to determine the adequacy of a CSP sponsored security by assessing its completeness in addressing most, if not all, risks that a service may be exposed to; the potential of that security to be adapted upon the identification of a security vulnerability during an audit, and how transparently such information is shared with the concerned Cloud Service Consumer (CSC). A level of assurance is associated to each of the C.A.RE parameters in order to help determine the overall trustworthiness of a CSP. The analysis and comparison of the C.A.RE approach to a well-known guideline as the Cloud Service Security Alliance guidelines, reveals that C.A.RE offers a clear and efficient way in determining a Trusted Cloud Service.

Background. There is a historical narrative of fear surrounding cyber-crime. This has extended to cryptocurrencies (CCs), which are often viewed as a criminal tool. Aim. To carry out the first user study of CCs for illicit activity, from the perspective of underground and dark net forums. Method. We conducted a qualitative study, using a content analysismethod, of 16,405 underground and dark net forum posts selected from CrimeBB, a dataset of 100 million posts curated by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. Results. Firstly, finality of payments emerged as a major motivator for the use of CCs. Second, we propose an Operational Security Taxonomy for Illicit Internet Activity to show that CCs are only one part of several considerations that combine to form security in illicit internet transactions. Third, the dark net is hard to use and requires significant study, specialist equipment and advanced knowledge to achieve relative security. Conclusion. We argue that finality is the main advantage of CCs for this user group, not anonymity as widely thought. The taxonomy shows that banning CCs is unlikely to be effective. Finally, we contend that the dark net is a niche for criminal activity and fears over cybercrime cause the threat to be exaggerated.
Blockchain is an innovative technology that gives built-in security to any software or application. There is a wide range of applications for blockchain, from risk management to financial services, crypto-currencies and the Internet of Things (IoT). This innovation is based on transparency, immutability, security, efficiency and decentralization. It is a trending topic since cryptocurrencies are a hot topic in the market. Blockchain is a combination of mathematics, cryptography, algorithms and models. In this paper, we present a general overview of the security aspects of blockchain technology.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization announced an outbreak of SARS-CoV2, which caused COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Soon, a continuous outbreak of coronavirus infection was declared a pandemic. This situation has led to an increase in cybercrime. Cybercriminals did not stray from the situation and used the pandemic to commit various digital frauds and cyberattacks. As a result, the objective of the investigation was to analyze computer crimes at the COVID-19 scene and identify their social and legal consequences. This is a documentary-based investigation. It is concluded that, security standards have deteriorated in the context of forty social as many organizations were not prepared for remote work and the number of victims of cybercrime will only grow soon. International organizations and law enforcement agencies in many countries issue many recommendations to prevent digital criminal acts against businesses and citizens. This situation also prompted active legislation around the world to deal with the crisis. Most of the rules adopted in recent months are likely to be derogated.
By studying the psychological profile of cyberscam victims, we may be able to develop more effective methods to reduce the rates of this type of cybercrime substantially. This paper examined which psychological and socio-demographic characteristics predicted cyberscam victimhood, in general, and across individual cyberscams (including, consumer, charity, investment, and romance scams). In line with the hypotheses, more impulsive and neurotic individuals were more likely to be scammed by cyberscams, in general. Contrary to the hypotheses, those who scored high on internal locus of control, men, and educated people were more likely to be tricked by cyberscams, in general. Some important differences between the types of cyberscams were also identified. Investment scam victims were more likely to be older, men, and score higher on internal locus of control compared with the other cyberscam victims. Consumer scam victims, in contrast to other scam victims, were more likely to be women and were less educated. The work here suggests that there is merit in systematically characterizing different types of cyberfrauds and examining, in detail, a typology of cyberscam victims by scam type. It suggests that a 'one size fits all model' to explain cyberscam victimhood is limiting.
Rapid development has been observed in the deployment of communication technologies and the use of the Internet across the globe. Information exchange is the main aspect of use of such technologies in everyday life. Crimes associated with the misuse of information on the Internet are on the increase and are resulting in various losses. Saudi Arabia is one of the fastest developing countries in the Middle East, where the uptake of communication technologies such as the Internet and mobile technologies has risen sharply in recent years. These technologies are relatively new to the region when compared to developed countries. Therefore, the crimes associated with these technologies may be new to the people in the region. This paper investigates the cyber security awareness of the people in Saudi Arabia within different contexts. A quantitative online based survey was conducted to gather information related to cyber security awareness in Saudi Arabia. The study found that, although the participants had a good knowledge of IT, their awareness of the threats associated with cybercrime, cyber security practices, and the role of government and organisations in ensuring information safety across the Internet, is very limited. An application based model to create cyber security awareness in the region was preferred by the majority. The results indicated that, although cybercrime is on the rise, no specific approach is being followed to increase cyber security awareness in the region except for CERT regulations and online information on government websites. Additionally, Chi-Square test results (t(627)=3.85, p=0.013) indicated that Internet skills have an effect on cyber security practices from the users' end and there is an association between skill level and the security measures being implemented by organisations in the region. The study found that there is an immediate need to develop a model to create cyber security awareness in the region in order to combat cybercrime.
Participants attending this special lecture will learn why current laws prohibiting cyberstalking are difficult to enforce and how an additional protocol to the Budapest Convention could help.
An unauthorized leak of information that is not tolerable always implies inadequate or poor security measures of information. Globally, the hospitality industry has in the recent past been targeted by cybercrimes. Management of cybercrimes are divided into facets like policies of security frameworks, cyber-threats, and management appreciating the value of Information Technology investment. These aspects possess a notable influence on the information security of an organization. This study's purpose is to examine cybersecurity activities of network threats, electronic information, and the techniques of preventing cybercrime in hotels. Helping Chief Information Officers (CIO) and the directors of information technology is the main aim of the research to improve policy for electronic information security in the hospitality industry and recommending several tools and techniques to stabilize the network of computers. Further, to protect personal information disclosure for the visitors, an information hiding technique has been proposed by utilizing the least significant bits (LSBs) of each pixel of grayscale image adopting XOR features of the host image (HI) pixels. Also, the proposed technique successfully withstands various steganalysis attacks like regular and singular (RS) attack, pixel difference histogram (PDH) attack, and subtractive pixel adjacency matrix (SPAM) steganalysis.
Background: Phishing is a cybercrime in which the attackers usually impersonate a trusted source. The attackers usually send an email that contains a link that allows them to steal the receiver's personal information. In the United States, phishing is the number one cybercrime by victim count according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2019 internet crime report. Several studies investigated ways to increase awareness and improve employees' resistance to phishing attacks. However, in 2019, successful phishing attacks continued to rise at a high rate Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of personality-based antecedents on phishing susceptibility in a health care context. Methods: Survey data were collected from participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk to test a proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. Results: A total of 200 participants took part. Health concerns, disposition to trust, and risk-taking propensity yielded higher phishing susceptibility. This highlights the important of personality-based factors in phishing attacks. In addition, females had a higher phishing susceptibility than male participants Conclusions: While previous studies used health concerns as a motivator for contexts such as sharing personal health records with providers, this study shed light on the danger of higher health concerns in enabling the number one cybercrime.
The Internet and advances in modern technology have greatly enhanced people's ability to interact worldwide. Furthermore, social media has radically transformed communication and changed the behaviour of society. This has led social media to become an important platform for businesses to interact with customers, build brand communities and market their products and services. It also provides customers with information exchange, reviews and support. Overall this has improved and advanced long-term relationships between brands and customers. However, these advantages have come at a cost that largely stems from cybercrime, which has become a major concern. Norton (2011) reported that there are 14 cybercrime victims a second, and with the increase in internet use, that figure is likely to have risen since 2011. Recent studies have found an increase in cybercrime on social media, particularly phishing, which saw a 500% increase the fourth quarter of 2016 (Proofpoint, 2016). Phishing is a form of online fraud initially done through email in which criminals pose as someone else using deception facilitated by online anonymity. A new development in social media phishing emerged in 2015: angler phishing. This type of phishing differs from traditional email phishing, as it involves the cybercriminals creating social media accounts that mimic well-known businesses to gain information. This form of phishing is particularly insidious due to the ease with which brand impersonation can be carried out on social media, the lack of effort required by the criminal, the potential reputational damage to the brand and the social media platform. Additionally and importantly, the damage caused to the victim where there are, for example, cases of identity fraud. The primary research for this paper identified a gap in the literature and sets out to investigate parts involved in angler phishing, why criminals have adopted angler phishing, and it outlines how these attacks differ from traditional phishing techniques. The paper also touches on the specific challenges faced when dealing with social media angler phishing. Suggesting that solutions must be collaborative and include multiple agencies such as government and industry for better outcomes. Specifically, it is argued that social media and brands must take responsibility in dealing with angler phishing and promote greater user awareness.
Over the last decade, there has been a rise in cybercrime services offered on a feefor-service basis, enabling individuals to direct attacks against various targets. One of the recent services offered involves stresser or booter operators, which offer distributed reflected denial of service (DRDoS) attacks on an hourly or subscription basis. These attacks involve the use of malicious traffic reflected off of webservers to increase the volume of traffic, which is directed toward websites and servers rendering them unusable. Researchers have examined DRDoS attacks using real-time data, though few have considered the experience of their customers and the factors associated with the likelihood of successful attack outcomes. This study examines this issue using a binary logistic regression analysis of survey responses from a population of stresser clients. The implications of this study for our understanding of the social factors underlying cyberattacks is discussed in depth.
Cybercriminal markets serve as hubs for offenders and enable the sale of illegal goods and services. Thus far, the primary tactics that have been employed against these sites are arrests of cybercriminals and takedowns of marketplace infrastructure. This research note examines a different genus of disruptive strategy: attacks on user reputation. In this area, there has been some scholarly discussion of slander and Sybil operations as a means of fostering distrust. But carrying out empirical work on the effectiveness of these tactics is challenging. This research note presents a possible method for investigating this topic: social laboratory experiments. It reports on a feasibility pilot study inspired by cybercrime disruption, but which speaks to a broader range of extra-legal markets.
The global situation with cybercrime is worsening. The study aims to investigate the concept of lawful behavior in the context of challenges facing the IT sector and from the perspective of previous and modern theoretical and legal views concerning the formation of lawful behavior. The paper outlines factors that shape the lawful behavior of digital natives. The results of the literature review suggest that a digital shift of legal relations objectively reduces the role of the socio-hierarchical factor in the formation of lawful behavior. This research is of practical interest to specialists in legal and sociological fields.
The article briefly expresses the possibilities of creating a cybernetic space model of the current Internet environment as a classic means of committing cyber crime as well as detecting these forms of crime. Part of the paper deals with the basic principles of the use of artificial intelligence to identify (identify) the basic and possible virtual images of criminalistic versions, primary and even urgent acts at the crime scene through operative search activities, and possible simplified evidence of cyber crime in criminal proceedings. It also deals briefly with international cooperation and prevention of cyber security in active cyber defense and the fight against cyber crime using police experience.
This article examines the laws that apply to encryption in New Zealand. Specifically, it analyses the different types of law that constitute an encryption legal framework in the country, namely: export control, substantive cybercrime, criminal procedure, human rights, and information security and data protection. The article then utilises the encryption laws and legal framework to evaluate a proposal by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance to regulate the use of end-to-end encryption in messaging services. The article concludes that the proposal is incompatible with the country's encryption legal framework.
"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a political and economic union of the Arab states, comprising some of the fastest growing economies in the world due to the prevalence of oil and gas industry and more recently due to significant investments in the digital economy. However, in recent years, rates of cybercrime and cyber-threats have risen significantly, posing challenges to the security and economic performance of the region. This article deals with the necessity to engage in transnational cooperation to counter the complex challenges posed by cybercrime across the GCC. Interviews were held with members of the GCC political elite who hold expertise in cybersecurity affairs. An analysis is presented of cybersecurity threats in the region, problems of strategic cooperation and lack of dialogue to tackle common challenges in the areas of cybercrime and cybersecurity. Finally, specific aspects of GCC cybersecurity policy are discussed: preventive and mitigation actions; potential intraregional and international cooperation avenues; and the formulation of effective strategy to enhance cybersecurity capabilities and resilience. Although grounded in the GCC as a regional bloc, the findings also carry implications for other contexts, especially other Middle East and North Africa countries and, thus, represent a promising avenue for future research."
In today's cybersecurity landscape, the primary goal is to protect against threats, but cybersecurity's influence extends beyond mere defense. We highlight how cybersecurity practices can impact productivity in both software development and day-to-day operations.
The widespread diffusion of the digital culture and technology, involving both individual and population, together with the fast pacing digital globalization process (far surpassing political' globalization), is radically changing the world social landscape, including medicine and clinical research. The most significant change in clinical research is the ever more frequent acceptance of observational data, both through the use of registry of rare or common conditions and the implementation of capillary networks recording the daily clinical practice (Electronic Health Recording system). By becoming observational' clinical practice should change significantly: (i) record of different data (epidemiological, clinical, and administrative) in inter-operational database, producing a dynamic map of the health demands, either met or not, that allows a reconfiguration of the health systems capable to adapt to the shifting clinical needs. Implicate the larger group possible of patients and healthy individuals, who, through smartphone technology, could participate in primary and secondary prevention projects and epidemiological analyses. (ii) Support scientific research by integrating it with the clinical practice as instrument of good government that is scientific evidence-based Public Health System: the Learning Health System. The road will be long and gruelling. A first negative by-product is the proliferation of cybercrime throughout digital medicine.
This comparison of cybercrime offenders within and outside the workplace reveals they display very different types of offending behaviour, involving different demographics, initiation pathways, and types of offence. The Cambridge Computer Crime Database (CCCD) is a database of open source information about cybercrime arrests and prosecutions in the United Kingdom. This study analyses data from the CCCD spanning nine years, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2018. Insiders are more likely to be older, and commit less-technical offences, primarily data and system breaches. They are less likely to offend with others, the offences are less likely to be international in nature, and they are less likely to receive a custodial sentence. Most alleged offenders are men, but women are more likely to offend within their occupation than outside the workplace. Of those that offend in the workplace, the largest group consists of police officers or police staff. This is likely to reflect differences in the type of organisations that pursue criminal action against insiders. We draw on a strain theory framework to argue that these findings accord with different kinds of strain and differing reactions to strain. The data for crimes outside the workplace support a 'subcultural' pattern of adaptation to strain, with offenders tending to be younger, male and linked to co-offenders. The findings relating to insiders support an opportunity model of crime, with inter-workplace variation in opportunities, working cultures and sources of strain present in different workplaces.
Cybercrime has become a growing business. The marketplaces for such businesses tend to be online forums. Much of the research on carding forums has been qualitative, but there have been quantitative analyses as well. One such type of analysis is topic modeling, a clustering technique that groups forum users according to the textual comments they leave. However, this type of research so far has been exclusively quantitative, without qualitatively examining the topics. The following study attempts to add to this research by analyzing the comment histories from 30,469 users from three carding forums. The results have revealed that users belong to one or more of 21 different topics. The topics are grouped into six broader categories, consisting of a customer base, identity fraud market, crimeware market, free content market, and two others. Descriptives are provided displaying how the topics are distributed across the three websites and directions for future research are discussed.
The Darkweb, part of the deep web, can be accessed only through specialized computer software and used for illegal activities such as cybercrime, drug trafficking, and exploitation. Technological advancements like Tor, bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies allow criminals to carry out these activities anonymously, leading to increased use of the Darkweb. At the same time, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping our behavior, and influencing how we interact with each other and the world. This work carries out the bibliometric study on the research conducted on Darkweb over the last decade. The findings illustrate that most research on Darkweb can be clustered into four areas based on keyword co-occurrence analysis: (i) network security, malware, and cyber-attacks, (ii) cybercrime, data privacy, and cryptography, (iii) machine learning, social media, and artificial intelligence, and (iv) drug trafficking, cryptomarket. National Science Foundation from the United States is the top funder. Darkweb activities interfere with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) laid forth by the United Nations to promote peace and sustainability for current and future generations. SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) has the highest number of publications and citations but has an inverse relationship with Darkweb, as the latter undermines the former. This study highlights the need for further research in bitcoin, blockchain, IoT, NLP, cryptocurrencies, phishing and cybercrime, botnets and malware, digital forensics, and electronic crime countermeasures about the Darkweb. The study further elucidates the multi-dimensional nature of the Darkweb, emphasizing the intricate relationship between technology, psychology, and geopolitics. This comprehensive understanding serves as a cornerstone for evolving effective countermeasures and calls for an interdisciplinary research approach. The study also delves into the psychological motivations driving individuals towards illegal activities on the Darkweb, highlighting the urgency for targeted interventions to promote pro-social online behavior.
"The digital revolution has undoubtedly produced new patterns of crime and deviance in contemporary societies and has created new research agenda for the discipline of criminology. The discipline of cyber criminology was founded in 2007 by Indian Criminologist, Professor Karuppannan Jaishankar. Though, still in its infancy; the emerging sub-field is fraught with several challenges. Since, its inception most research efforts on cyber criminology have tended to be cybercrime-biased, thereby neglecting the other two important components of the sub-discipline: cyber deviance and cyberterrorism. This paper discusses the history and evolution of cyber criminology as well as the challenges confronting cyber criminological scholarship. It calls for the restructuring of criminology curriculum at undergraduate and postgraduate levels to include a course on cyber criminology. It also calls for the introduction of Bachelor's degree in cyber criminology programme across universities around the world."
The advance growth of cybercrime in recent years especially in high critical networks becomes an urgent issue to the security authorities. They compromised computer system, targeting especially to government sector, ecommerce and banking networks rigorously and made it difficult to detect the perpetrators. Attackers used a powerful technique, by embedding a malicious code in a normal webpage that resulted harder detection. Early detection and act on such threats in a timely manners is vital in order to reduce the losses which have caused billions of dollars every year. Previously, the detection of malicious is done through the use of blacklisting repository. The repository or database was compiled over time through crowd sourcing solution (e.g.: PishTank, Zeus Tracker Blacklist, StopBadWare.. etc.). However, such technique cannot be exhaustive and unable to detect newly generated malicious URL or zero-day exploit. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey and detailed understanding of malicious code and URL features which have been extracted from the web content and structures of the websites. We studied the characteristic of malicious webpage systematically and syntactically and present the most important features of malicious threats in web pages. Each category will be presented along with different dimensions (features representation, algorithm design, etc.).
The federal government, all fifty states, and dozens of foreign countries have enacted computer crime statutes that prohibit unauthorized access to computers. No one knows what it means to access a computer, however, or when access becomes unauthorized. The few courts that have construed these terms have offered widely varying interpretations. Several recent decisions suggest that any breach of contract renders an access unauthorized, broadly criminalizing contract law on the Internet. In this Article, Professor Orin Kerr explains the origins of unauthorized access statutes, and examines why the early beliefs that such statutes articulated a clear standard have proven remarkably naive. He then shows how and why the courts have construed these statutes in an overly broad manner that threatens to criminalize a surprising range of innocuous conduct involving computers. Finally, Professor Kerr offers a normative proposal for interpreting access and authorization. Courts should reject a contract-based theory of authorization, and should limit the scope of unauthorized access statutes to circumvention of code-based restrictions on computer privileges. This proposed interpretation best mediates between securing privacy and protecting the liberty interests of Internet users. It also mirrors criminal law's traditional treatment of consent defenses, and avoids possible constitutional difficulties that may arise under the broader constructions that courts have recently favored.
Gottfredson and Hirschi's general theory of crime argues individuals with low self-control are more likely to engage in crime on and off-line. There is less research considering the role of opportunity, as low self-control should increase individuals' willingness to act on opportunities to offend. The importance of opportunity is distinct for cybercrime, as technology access may be differentially impacted by various demographic factors. This study surveyed 1,411 South Australian adolescents enrolled at secondary schools across a large metropolitan region to examine the relationships between opportunity and self-control for four forms of computer hacking. A series of binary logistic regression models illustrated that distinct opportunity factors and low self-control are associated with each form of hacking.
Criminological research has demonstrated the significant relationship between deviant peer associations, a lack of self-control, and individual delinquency. These relationships also account for involvement in cybercrime, though these results are based largely on adult samples. There is less research considering juvenile offending online, particularly examining involvement in property-based offenses such as computer hacking. This study utilized an international sample of 48,327 juvenile respondents in the Second International Self-Report of Delinquency (ISRD-2) study to examine the role of gender as a moderating factor in the relationship between deviant peer associations, self-control, opportunity, and self-reported computer hacking behavior. The findings demonstrated different correlates associated with hacking for males and females, as well as differences on the basis of urban and rural residency.
Ransomware is malicious software (malware) that blocks access to someone's computer system or files on the system and subsequently demands a ransom to be paid for unlocking the computer or files. Ransomware is considered one of the main threats in cybercrime today. Cryptoware is a specific type of ransomware, which encrypts files on computer systems. The ransom is often demanded in bitcoins. Based on desk research, a series of interviews, and the investigation of several police files, this paper investigates the modi operandi in which cybercriminals use ransomware and cryptoware to make profits and how they launder these profits. Two models, based on the payment of the ransom via vouchers and via bitcoins respectively, are identified and described. These methods allow criminals to launder profits in relative anonymity and prevent the seizure of the illegally obtained money.
"Managing effective security of personal customer data located in computer networks has become a strategic business and public policy issue for the U.S. retail sector. The article discusses the global credit card payment industry self-regulation regime established by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (Council) to combat cybercrime, comparing and evaluating the Council's existing standards regime to the theory and practices found in the industry self-regulation literature. A review of national cybercrime trends in both the volume and financial impacts (losses) of electronic financial record breaches on the U.S. retail sector is presented. After identifying the primary areas of retail electronic records breach vulnerability, an improved industry standards framework is developed that proposes to enhance security and minimize data privacy compromises through the adoption of recommended pure industry self-regulation (improved security standard) and market force mechanisms (mandatory cyber liability insurance coverage). The article concludes with a discussion of the implementation of the proposed industry self-regulation and market force framework; its current limitations; and what technology advancements may bring in the future to provide more effective security and protection for consumers' personal data and financial transactions.

Increasingly severe cybercrime results in heavy impact and loss for society and public security of various countries, and even influences Homeland security. Based on previous experiences, the most effective method to resist cybercrime and reduce its impact and damage is that law enforcement agencies (LEA) identify and arrest criminals within the shortest time possible after a crime occurs. Therefore, IP location and IP Individualization play key roles. In view of this, this study proposes an IP user tracking forensics mechanism, based on the concepts of IP location and computational forensics, to develop forensics tracking on the Internet. The proposed mechanism can instantly trace the physical location of cybercriminals when cybercrimes occurs, analyze the probable identity associatively, and reconstruct the historical physical path of the cybercriminal. The proposed mechanism was implemented for verification. The results showed that the accuracy of IP location is 0 m error on the fixed network, while the mobile network could reach Cell-ID covered range (150-500 m radius in urban area). The identity of cybercriminal could be successfully reasoned out, with segmental paths (e. g. tracking breakpoints) reconstructed by algorithm, thus, obtaining the complete path of the target. The average success ratio (predictable ratio) was 90.91%, and the accuracy rate was 88.70%.
Cybercrimes are growing in Vietnam to pose a number of complicated modus operandi with its sophisticated activities. Dealing with cybercrime's threats is challenging when Vietnam has still lacked manpower policies and professional technologies. As the first specific analyses to focus on Vietnam's context, this paper discusses the efforts taken by the Government of Vietnam to deal with these concerns. Using grey literature with a number of official data and Vietnamese reports, the authors analysis leading-point provisions of Vietnam in combating high-tech crimes and assess legislative frameworks as well as the role of law enforcement authorities. It argued that under distinguished features of communist country, top-and-down organizational model of law enforcement to prevent and combat cyber-related crimes are still effective. To end, some recommendations and call for further researches in the related field in Vietnam will also encourage for scholars, law enforcement, and policymakers.
The advancement of the Internet and digital technology has enabled individuals to commit crimes affecting both virtual and real targets at will. Criminological scholarship related to cybercrime and technology-enabled offending has primarily focused on offenders and victims, calling to question how police agencies effectively respond to these incidents. Limited empirical research has largely focused on line officers, who view these cyber offenses to be less serious in comparison to traditional crimes. Research examining the perceptions of detectives and inspectors is virtually nonexistent, though they are much more likely to have an investigative responsibility to pursue offenders and engage with citizens about the offense. Thus, there is a need to understand the attitudes inspectors hold toward online crime in order to improve our knowledge of police views and inform policy makers in building effective strategies to aid their response to unique and emerging crime types. This study examined the attitudinal factors associated with online crimes and incidents using a sample of 155 inspectors from 26 local agencies across England and Wales. The implications of this study for both police detectives and law enforcement agencies are discussed in detail.
The dark web is a subsection of the deep web that conventional search engines cannot index. As an encrypted network of websites, the dark web can only be accessed using special browsers such as Tor. Tor, formerly an acronym for The Onion Router, is a free and open-source software intended to protect the personal privacy of its users and keep their internet activities unmonitored. While the dark web is known for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes, it remains notorious for facilitating illegal and deviant activities ranging from drug dealing to child pornography, human trafficking, arms dealing, and extremist recruitment. Accordingly, researching and understanding the dark web is a critical and essential step in fighting and preventing cybercrime. However, studying the dark web poses unique challenges. This special issue seeks to provide a platform for researchers and criminologists to share and discuss research designs and methods that help shed light on the actual activity going on in the dark web's shadowy realms.
As EU security is an intergovernmental policy area, it has been assumed that the only relevant policy-shapers are member states. However, more recent analyses show that supranational actors, like the Commission, have developed strategies to enhance their role in this traditionally interstate realm. This article endorses this reasoning and intends to cast some light on these strategies. Building on Kingdon's concept of the policy entrepreneur and using EU's cybersecurity policy as an empirical case, we analyse the Commission's initiatives to draft a European response to cybercrime, in order to answer one central research question: how has the Commission managed to secure a prominent role in a highly salient security issue? The findings suggest that the Commission, acting as a policy entrepreneur, purposefully explored a market-security nexus in order to influence an otherwise intergovernmental security domain. Ultimately, the Commission was a much more relevant player than expected.
In the field of technology, cybersecurity has a significant role, and the security data become one between the most critical problems faced in today's world. When there is discussion regarding the cyber-crimes which are increasing very rapidly, the government and many corporations are having many measures so as for stopping these kinds of crimes. Inspire of many different steps, cybercrime is still increasing day by day. In this study, there is brief coverage over the challenges faced by the cybersecurity from new technology advancement and innovations and in addition to this, the paper also has its main focus on the latest cybersecurity techniques, trends and other ethics involved in the sector of cybersecurity.
In the present article, the authors address the process of digitalization of the economy and the increased crime in the digital economy. They consider the reasons for the latency of cybercrime, the issues of defining criminal offences committed in the IT sphere, and their classification. The authors propose specific measures aimed at preventing crime in the digital economy. The most important of these measures is the development of national innovative systems, which is expected to ensure economic growth and increase the competitiveness of the national digital economy.
The article defines the range of socially dangerous acts committed using the information and telecommunications network Internet, which are currently prohibited by the criminal law of Russia. Based on official data of the Federal State Statistics Service, the current state of counteraction to these crimes is analyzed. In order to effectively counter these negative phenomena, measures have been formulated to prevent crimes committed using the Internet information and telecommunications network-legal, organizational, and software-technical. In addition, as part of the elimination of circumstances conducive to the commission of cybercrime, we can not neglect the measures of software and hardware confrontation to attackers.
The Internet of Things (IoT) device is becoming universal domain and its success cannot be ignored, but its threats on IoT devices increases concurrently. The Cyber-attacks are becoming the component of IoT affecting user's life. The professionals are forced to sift huge data to unveil and manage litigations. Hence, secure IoT is required for comprehending attacks. A model is presented for discovering cyber attack considering feature fusion. The routing of data towards Base Station (BS) is done with the Fractional gravitational search algorithm (FGSA). At BS, cybercrime detection is done, wherein data is splitted with enhanced Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) considering the MapReduce model. In mapper, the feature fusion is done with mutual information and the Deep Quantum Neural Network (DQNN), while reducer performs cybercrime detection. The Fractional Mayfly Shepherd Optimization (FrMSO)-based Deep Belief Network (DBN) is devised for describing the digital examination to notice and trace behaviors of attacks in IoT. Here, the training of DBN is done by the proposed FrMSO algorithm, which is developed by integrating the Fractional Calculus (FC), Mayfly Optimization Algorithm (MA), and the Shuffled shepherd optimization Algorithm (SSOA). The developed model helps to employ the weights of DBN with FrMSO for determining and tracing the abnormal aspects in IoT. The FrMSO-based DBN presented elevated precision of 96.4%, recall of 98.3% and F-measure of 95.4% respectively.
It is well known that criminals, who operate outside the law and the protection of the state, face difficulties in cooperating due both to the requirement of secrecy and a deficit of trust. For cybercriminals the anonymity of the Internet creates further challenges, making it even more difficult to assess trustworthiness and enforce agreements. Yet, contrary to expectations, collaboration among cybercriminals is prevalent, and a sophisticated industry has emerged. The purpose of this paper is to address this puzzle in relation to profit-driven cybercrime. It draws on a collection of interviews with former cybercriminals that provide a valuable form of data on micro-level and often secretive interactions. It examines four key mechanisms that lead to improved cooperation: reputation, appearance, performance and enforcement. It also addresses the rarely discussed, and somewhat counterintuitive, role that offline interactions may play in enhancing collective action among cybercriminals.
Following the most significant data breaches in Australia's history, targeting Optus and Medibank, in November 2022 Australia's Minster for Home Affairs and Cybersecurity Clare O'Neil announced 'a new model of policing' involving a collaboration between the Australian Federal Police and Australian Signals Directorate. This collaboration would result in a new taskforce focused on 'hacking the hackers' or disrupting criminal groups responsible for high-profile cyber-attacks against Australian entities. Since this announcement, significant discussion has ensued regarding the meaning of state-implemented 'disruption' and questions have been raised about the potential mandate and operations of the newly announced taskforce. This paper explores the concept of disruption as it applies to cyber-criminal groups. It then turns to considerations for policy and practice regarding the pursuit of disruption. The paper aims to advance existing understanding of disruption and encourage further research and policy debate into the policing of cybercrime as the Australian government commences work on the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy.
The best known software developers all offer cloud storage services. Microsoft offers Onedrive to its users, Apple offers iCloud Drive and Google offers Google Drive or GDrive. The battle between these software developers is ongoing and they will always strive to give the best services to their users. It is not only technology that is evolving, however, but also ways in which security can be breached and data abused. The security of information on the Internet is increasingly at risk and there are many threats to cloud storage platforms. This research used the mobile forensics approach to help in identifying and analyzing user behavior that may occur while using GDrive application for cybercrime. The novelty of comparison and analyzing methods performed in this research can help to find remnant data from all activities performed by GDrive users in Android smartphones. Hence, this proposed method can assist investigators in finding remnant data on GDrive client and can provide knowledge for legal practitioners.
Biometric authentication is gaining the interest of private, public, consumer electronics and corporate security systems. For the protection of cyberspace from hackers and other harmful people, biometric security is growing more and more popular among organizations, individuals and enterprises. The word cyber security refers to the procedures, techniques, and tools used to safeguard data, network system, computer networks and software from potential attacks online. Online financial service delivery is referred to as cyber banking. As the trend of exchanging things has changed, internet banking has grown. Despite the benefits, there have been instances of security threat-related issues with Internet banking. To identify persons, biometric security verifies their physical attributes and behavioral traits. For identification verification, it is the most reliable and effective physical security method. According to biometric authentication, people can be recognized precisely based on their innate behavioral or physical traits. Numerous security measures have been implemented throughout the entire Internet banking service to address these issues. Globally, cybercrime has deep roots and poses a significant threat to the occurrence of criminal or terrorist behavior. Without being addressed by a single authority, these risks can compromise security on the inside as well as the outside. If the cybercrime goes unnoticed, both money and personal data are lost. Internet services and information infrastructure have previously been targeted in assaults. Online fraud and hacker attacks are only two examples of the daily computer-related crimes that take place. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most reliable foundation for facilitating high-quality, comfortable human living. IoT has had a substantial impact across a range of application domains. Smart gadgets are more vulnerable to hackers because of their rapid development and trust in wireless mechanics for data transport. As a result, the rate of cybercrime is rising daily. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity emerges because of technological advancement and poses a risk to public safety, personal property rights, and privacy protection for people. The study elaborates on the key features of biometrics system in conventional and Islamic banking to counter the risk of cybersecurity and provide high safety and security to the banking industry. For this systematic literature review, the most suitable and most relevant 101 articles from the reputed online libraries are selected. This analysis absorbed four research questions and pertinent keywords from the period of 2009 to 2022 (a part of 2023 was included).
Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore human factors as the possible facilitator of cyber-dependent (hacking and malware infection) and cyber-enabled (phishing) crimes victimisation and to test the applicability of lifestyle routine activities theory (LRAT) to cybercrime victimisation. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods research paradigm was applied to address the research questions and aims. The data set of Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) 2014/2015 and 42 semi-structured interviews conducted with victims of cybercrime and non-victim control group participants were analysed via binary logistic regression and content analyses methods. Findings This research illustrated that Internet users facilitated their victimisation through their online activities. Additionally, using insecure Internet connections and public access computers emerged as risk factors for both cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Voluntary and involuntary personal information disclosure through social networking sites and online advertisement websites increased the likelihood of being a target of phishing. Deviant online activities such as free streaming or peer-to-peer sharing emerged to increase the risk of cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Research limitations/implications The binary logistic regression analysis results suggested LRAT as a more suitable theoretical framework for cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Future research may test this result with models including more macro variables. Practical implications Policymakers may consider implementing regulations regarding limiting the type of information required to login to free Wi-Fi connections. Checking trust signs and green padlocks may be effective safeguarding measures to lessen the adverse impacts of impulsive buying. Originality/value This study empirically illustrated that, besides individual-level factors, macro-level factors such as electronic devices being utilised to access the Internet and data breaches of large companies also increased the likelihood of becoming the victim of cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime.
"The aim of the presented study is to conceptualize and regulate the meaning of the term social cyberdeviation. The analysis carried out in the first part was based on the etymological and inductive methods, as well as contextual analysis with the definitions of cross-border cybercrime. To achieve the aim of the work and indicate the contents of the concept, it turned out to be necessary to determine whether it is possible to indicate the existence of standards among the online virtual community that are recognized by most of its members. The nominal definition of cyberdeviation as a violation of the norms prevailing in the virtual community is the starting point for the second part of the article, the purpose of which is to classify activities that violate the norms in cyberspace. The gradation of behavior indicates that the situations on the Internet are: low-intensity activities that focus primarily on social norms, not legal norms; medium intensity, where the criterion is a violation of a legal norm; high intensity acts that are legally penalized nor accepted in the entire community, which clearly violate social norms."
A vast and growing body of research has shown that crime tends to run in families. However, previous studies focused only on traditional crimes and research on familial risk factors for cyber offending is very scarce. To address this gap in the literature, the present study examines the criminal behavior of the family members of a sample of cyber offenders prosecuted in the Netherlands. The sample consists of 979 cyber offenders prosecuted for computer trespassing between 2001 and 2018, and two matched groups of 979 traditional offenders and 979 non-offenders. Judicial information and kinship data from Dutch Statistics were used to measure criminal behavior among family members. Both traditional offenders and cyber offenders were found to be more likely to have criminal fathers, mothers, and siblings than non-offenders. Additional analyses, however, showed different patterns between cyber offenders who were only prosecuted for cyber offenses and those who also committed traditional crimes. While the former group of cyber offenders were similar to non-offenders in terms of family offending, the latter group of cyber offenders were more similar to traditional offenders. Overall, these results suggest that the traditional mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of crime can only partially explain cybercrime involvement.
Purpose This paper argues that -dependent offending differs in important ways from other types of offending, which poses challenges to established life-course criminological explanations. Moreover, this study examines to what extent life circumstances in both private and professional life are differentially related to cyber-offending and traditional offending. Methods This study analyzes longitudinal registration data of all adults who have been at least once suspected of a cybercrime (N= 870) and/or a traditional crime (N= 1,144,740) in the Netherlands during the period of 2000-2012. Using fixed effects panel models, within-person effects of household composition, employment, and enrollment in education on the likelihood of cyber-offending are compared with those for traditional offending. Results Similar results are found with respect to individual's private lives. An individual is less likely to commit cybercrime as well as traditional crime in years in which that individual shares a household with a partner, whether with or without children, than in other years. For the professional life, several important differences are found. Employment and enrollment in education are not statistically significantly related to cyber-offending, whereas they reduce the likelihood of traditional offending. In fact, for these professional life circumstances, opposite effects are found in this population. Conclusions This first study to empirically compare cyber-offending and traditional offending over the life-course finds important similarities and differences. The results hint at the importance of possible cyber-criminal opportunities provided by otherwise preventive professional life circumstances.
Phishing is a form of social engineering and cybercrime which entails theft of confidential information (personal or official) for financial gain. That is one of the oldest cyber threats. There is a wide range of phishing attack techniques, and the most frequent one is performed via electronic mail. Due to major changes in conducting business in the last pandemic, which entail remote work, fast digital transformation and the increase of ICT technologies, the statistics show that phishing attacks are on the rise. Employees who lack developed awareness of phishing attacks, responsibility and knowledge represent a potential danger to the entire organisation. This paper describes the research on e-mail phishing recognition in business organisations in Primorje-Gorski kotar County. The research showed that employees are not aware of phishing attacks to a sufficient extent and that all the habits contributing to the IT security level regarding these attacks are not satisfying. To protect against such attacks, organisations should, in addition to implementing safety technical measures, actively educate employees and periodically implement testing.
In the last three decades there have been significant changes in the cybercrime world in terms of organization, type of attacks, and tools. Remote Access Trojans (RAT) are an intrinsic part of traditional cybercriminal activities but they have become a standard tool in advanced espionage and scams attacks. The overly specialized research in our community on Remote Access Trojans has resulted in a seemingly lack of general perspective and understanding on how RATs have evolved as a phenomenon. This work presents a new generalist perspective on Remote Access Trojans, an analysis of their growth in the last 30 years, and a discussion on how they have become a commodity in the last decade. We found that the amount of RATs increased drastically in the last ten years and that nowadays they have become standardized commodity products that are no very different from each other.
"Over the last few years, MENA region became an attractive target for cyber-attacks perpetrators. Hackers focus on governmental high valued sectors (i.e. oil and gas) alongside with other critical industries. MENA nations are increasingly investing in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) sector, social infrastructure, economic sector, schools and hospitals in the area are now completely based on the Internet. Currently, the position of ICTs became an essential phase of the domestic future and global security structure in the MENA Region, emphasizing the real need for a tremendous development in cybersecurity at a regional level. This environment raises questions about the developments in cybersecurity and offensive cyber tactics; this paper examines and investigates (1) the essential cybersecurity threats in MENA region, (2) the major challenges that faces both governments and organizations (3) the main countermeasures that governments follow to achieve the protection and business continuity in the region. It stresses the need for the importance of cybercrime legislation and higher defenses techniques towards cyberterrorism for MENA nations. It argues for the promotion of a cybersecurity awareness for the individuals as an effective mechanism for facing the current risks of cybersecurity in MENA region."
Ransomware attacks have become the fastest growing and most serious type of cybercrime. A ransomware attack does not only capture victims' data, but also prevents victims from accessing their own data until a ransom has been paid. The prevention of and recovery from a ransomware attack have become a major concern for governments and organizations. This paper presents guidelines for institutions to secure their systems from ransomware attacks and to put steps in place for recovery if their systems have been attacked. The human is often the weak link in allowing an intrusion into a network. African countries are at even greater risk because their populations are often not sufficiently trained nor aware of cybersecurity risks.
Cybercrime and other cybersecurity harms are gaining increasing political and public attention across many countries. One of the most serious and fastest growing categories of such harms relates to ransomware attacks. Many of the groups responsible for ransomware attacks have come under political pressure in recent years as they have become more aggressive in their methods and targeting. On a geopolitical level, an area attracting increasing interest is the complex relationships between ransomware groups and states, in particular, Russia. This paper introduces the concept of state crime to ransomware groups. Starting with the concept of proxies before turning to the historical examples of privateering and piracy, we focus on the notion of cyber privateers to analyze two select ransomware groups-DarkSide and REvil-that are believed to be affiliated with the Russian state. We argue that approaching these ransomware groups as cyber privateers engaged in state crime has the potential to enhance our understanding of how these groups operate. We further posit that a state crime perspective also assists in identifying how ransomware may be countered, highlighting the need for policy responses that are effective even when ransomware groups may be tacitly protected by a state.
This article examines configurations of digital concerns within the European Union (EU27), a leading hub of innovation and policy development. The core objective is to uncover the social forces shaping technology acceptance and risk awareness, which are essential for fostering a resilient digital society in the EU. The study draws upon Bourdieu's concept of capital to discuss technological capital and digital habitus and Beck's risk society theory to frame the analysis of individual and national attitudes towards digital risks. Utilizing Eurobarometer data, the research operationalizes technological capital through proxy indicators of individual socioeconomic status and internet use, while country-level development indicators are used to predict aggregated national risk perception. Article contributions rely on individual- and country-level statistical analysis. Specifically, the study reveals that digital concerns are better predicted at a national level rather than individual level, being shaped by infrastructure, policy, and narrative rather than by personal technological capital. Key findings highlight a positive and a negative correlation between digital advancement with cybersecurity fears and digital literacy, respectively. HDI and DESI are relevant country-level predictors of public concerns, while CGI values are not. Using cluster analysis, we identify and interpret four digital risk cultures within the EU, each with varying foci and levels of concern, which correspond to economic, political, and cultural influences at the national level.
The Iraqi academia and educational institutions are taking initiatives to consolidate their cyber security mechanism and build a healthy digital environment, and adapt to new methods of risk management. The current study was designed to evaluate the five independent variables: information security (IS), creative behavior (CB), cyber education (CE), cyber training (CT), Internet applications (IA) and one dependent variable, of digital awareness (DA). Out of the five independent variables, three belonged to institutional (IS, CE, & IA) and two were categorized as individual factors (CE & CT). All these five variables were examined to determine their impact on DA. The sample in this study comprised 140 academicians from three schools in East Iraq, selected through a simple random sampling method and snowballing technique. An online questionnaire of 25 items was built based on all variables and their indicators. The data was analyzed through descriptive data analysis methods, including parametric statistical tests, hypothesis testing and regression analysis, using the SPSS Ver 25. The EFA factor loadings, average variance extracted (AVE), Cronbach's alpha (alpha) as well as composite reliability (CR) were also used to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire items. The results of this study indicate that digital awareness has a direct positive effect on all other variables. Additionally, it is evident in this study that all activities converge into a comprehensive process to improve the digital awareness. The findings of this study imply that academic institutions in Iraq need to understand the significance of digital awareness and introduce new cybersecurity and information security programs in their curriculum and review and redesign the existing ones. Future studies may also explore the blended-learning methods to teach target groups and improve their knowledge about cybercrimes and their prevention.
Cybercrimecontinues to be agrowing challenge and malware is one of the most serious security threats on the Internet todaywhich have been in existence from the very early days. Cyber criminals continue to develop and advance their malicious attacks. Unfortunately, existing techniques for detecting malware and analysing code samples are insufficient and have significant limitations. For example, most of malware detection studies focused only on detection and neglected the variants of the code. Investigating malwarevariants allows antivirus products and governments to more easily detect these new attacks, attribution, predict such or similar attacks in the future, and further analysis. The focus of this paper is performing similarity measures between different malware binaries for the same variant utilizing data mining concepts in conjunction with hashing algorithms. In this paper, we investigate and evaluate using the Trend Locality Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) algorithm to group binaries that belong to the same variant together, utilizing the k-NN algorithm. Two Zeus variants were tested, TSPY_ZBOT and MAL_ZBOT to address the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We compare TLSH to related hashing methods (SSDEEP, SDHASH and NILSIMSA) that are currently used for this purpose. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method can effectively detect variants of malware and resilient to common obfuscations used by cyber criminals. Our results show that TLSH and SDHASH provide the highest accuracy results in scoring an F-measure of 0.989 and 0.999 respectively.
A careless use of technology and online addiction are prone to be victimized by cybercrimes such as online fraud. The incidents of online fraud are much higher if people spend too much time on the internet. The purpose of the research was to find out the causes and types of online frauds in Thailand and identify patterns of preventing online fraud victimization. By making use of qualitative research design, this study used indepth interview and focus group techniques for data collection. The sample size comprised 36 police officers who had the experience of handling online fraud cases from the Technology Crime Suppression Division, the Department of Special Investigation, and Metropolitan Police Bureau and 15 victims, who had filed complaints to the Technology Crime Suppression Division or local police station. The results revealed that there could be at least three causes of online fraud victimization, such as victims' inexperience, over -optimism, and acquisitiveness. In addition, types of online fraud online fraud comprise sale scam, hacking Facebook or Line accounts to borrow money, romance scams and financial or investment scams. This research recommends that government agencies involved in online fraud prevention should urgently campaign on the pattern of online fraud so that people would be aware of cybercrime damages.
This study aims to better understand transnational computer fraud in Vietnam utilizing crime script analysis. Data from criminal profiles and in-depth interviews with investigators were combined, and the results showed that Vietnam could become an operational base for both domestic and foreign criminals to implement transnational computer fraud. This type of fraud, which includes crimes with only minor technological elements and those involving almost entirely technological factors, represents the intersection of fraud, transnationality, and technology. Technology can support criminals in defrauding victims transnationally without the need for direct interaction. Moreover, the study clarified the different roles of Vietnamese and foreign offenders in the two types of transnational computer fraud: bank card data fraud and phone scams. As the first study of this nature implemented in Vietnam, this research contributes to the knowledge of computer fraud, especially in Asia, providing a foundation for future investigations related to this kind of cybercrime.
Spam is the sending of bulk, commercial, unsolicited electronic marketing messages. Today email spam makes up the majority of all email sent worldwide. The CAN SPAM Act is U.S. federal legislation that was passed in response to the growing spam problem. However, cybercrime such as email spam does not respect national borders, and spam can be sent from anywhere in the world, so it is questioned whether the CAN SPAM Act simply shifted spam beyond United States jurisdiction. The present research sought to address this question by analyzing the impact that prosecutions of spammers has had on a sample of 5,490,905 spam emails sent between 1998 and 2013. Two measures of spam nation of origin, U.S. IP address and U.S. domain name among spam emails, were created to assess the possible impact that the CAN SPAM Act might have had on the nation of origin associated with spam email messages. Results suggest a possible impact, with more ongoing CAN SPAM Act trials and media attention predicting less spam associated with the United States. CAN SPAM activity appeared to have the largest impact on US domain name registrations. Implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.
Smart cities have evolved in the last years, leading the cities to implement initiatives related to technical aspects to improve quality of life. City-rankings have become a central tool for assessing the attractiveness of urban regions. The development of smart cities, however, is not without risk. Cities and citizens are putting more and more responsibilities in urban systems. Hence, all key stakeholders should provide an effective safety and security response to any situation affecting their citizens or organizations. Special attention should be paid with respect to development of services aimed at reducing cybercrime. To prevent this, we believe that a better understanding of smart cities and their privacy implications is needed. The paper provides an overview of security aspects of a cyber security in smart cities. It starts with exploration of various definitions, threats, and risks in cyber security as well as threats from environments both internal and external and how these threats are currently mitigated with tools, processes and technologies as smart cities utilizes IoT with big data. Presently, most of the data is transmitted and collected online. Hackers usually try to exploit the vulnerabilities using various tools in order to know more about the customers and then misuse the customer's information. Enterprises, on the other hand, continue to collect more information in order to improve services, infrastructure, and security. They collect tons of data from customers in order to complete their requirements for the different services they provide. The main concern with the collected data is that it can be vulnerable to misuse by hackers. Building a security framework based on concepts and repositories of big data and leveraging on the intelligence of predictive analytics can help build a security system that can counter these threats and help to guard from these risk and threats to a large extent. Various concepts, applications, and technologies interact to cover every aspect of the digital citizen's life. Understanding this privacy-challenging environment is the basic requirement for the development of effective protection mechanisms. Thus, the paper aims to address sentiments on cyber security technologies and cybercrime awareness in order to come up with recommendations for innovative solutions. A survey has been conducted and the findings have been analyzed of a case study to come up with recommendations for building a conceptualizing security framework for smart cities. The survey is conducted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the most advanced countries in the MENA region, who is applying smart city concepts.
The rapid move to digital platforms of scientific and technical development of modern civilization has brought with it many different issues. One of them is the issue of preserving human privacy of a person who uses in communicative practices technical devices operating on the artificial intelligence technologies, which leads to an increase in the number of criminal attacks on his/her data presented on the Internet, and, as a result, infringement of his/her right to privacy. This paper analyzes the reasons for the increasing growth of criminal infringements that happen today in the World Wide Web. It also focuses on their complex and diverse nature. The convergence of external (objective) and internal (subjective) factors determines the transformations that occur to the identity of a modern Internet user. As a result, I conclude, in the conditions of the unraveling fight against cybercrime, the fundamental and legal sciences should pay attention to the concept of identity, which will help determine the specifics of transformations occurring to Internet users.
The anonymity provided in underground forums has led to the growth of illicit substance drug markets. Online markets seem to be safer for drug transactions, with reduced risks of being arrested. However, criminals seem to be conscious of the risks of keeping a dark web market user friendly. This study investigates both surface and dark web forums, focusing on online underground markets. This study aims to: a) investigate the ways risk is perceived among members and vendors of underground forums throughout stages of transactions and b) identify risk avoidance practices utilised within these online underground markets. We hypothesise that the discourse in these forums focuses on the risks of detection, both offline and in cyberspace, as well as relevant techniques for reducing such risks. Our findings indicate discourse on techniques and strategies for reducing the risk of detection and arrest. In addition, our findings highlight that decision-making with drug use is highly individualised and should be based on some research of the effects and benefits of each drug. These findings provide useful insights and can inform practices in policing, leading to the development of intervention approaches aiming to interrupt online underground markets.
Data deletion increases challenges in cybercrime investigation. To address the problem, proactive forensics for evidentiary collection is acknowledged to help investigators to acquire the potentially needed digital evidence. This study proposes a bot machine to record data from the Discord server in advance, hashing and saving it in proper storage for further forensic analysis. The recording process can be managed to collect activities and their related data (intact, modified, deleted), including text, pictures, videos, and audio. The Discord bot is designed by utilizing the main features of the Discord Social Networks Application Programming Interface (API). This paper examines how this approach is applicable by embedding the bot in a Discord server. Observation showed that the bot records the real-time data as it is always alive on the server, including the deleted or modified messages and their timestamps. All the recorded data is saved locally on the server's storage in easy-toread formats, CSV and JSON. The results showed that the bot could conduct the data acquisition for 37 concurrent users with a 2.3% error rate and 97.7% accuracy.
Cyber crimes rapidly increased over the past years, with attackers performing large-scale activities, using sophisticated and complex tactics and techniques, that have targeted governments, companies, and even strategic infrastructures. To tackle these attacks, the cyber-security community usually shares Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) that includes the collected Indicators of Compromise (IoC) using several open or private sharing platforms. In this paper, we study the informativeness and relevance of the IoCs related to cyber crimes following a major real-world event such as the war in Ukraine, which started in February 2022. To this end, we analyze different kinds of attacks available in a crowd-sourced dataset of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports. Our analysis shows that while this data is able to capture major trends such as the ones following major events, the degree of miscellaneous information inside the reports makes it difficult to discern the association of a specific trace unequivocally.
Cybercrime has expanded in various areas as the number of websites and hosting services has grown significantly. The identification of hostile domain names has recently gained the interest of researchers in order to avoid cyber-attacks. In terms of network traffic and content, several attempts have been made to distinguish these names. The novel approach proposed in this paper utilizes the neural network-based algorithms to recognize the potentially hostile domain names. An LSTM network is created and prepared based on the dataset. The primary task is to first divide the URL into subdomain, domain, and domain-suffix. Then based on this, the proposed neural network is trained to classify the given data set as malicious or benign. The proposed system can perform well with a higher level of accuracy on the validation set.
"The continuous development and improvement of information and technology have prompted businesses to implement various technological techniques to complete daily tasks efficiently. This strategy has effectively reduced costs and time; however, excessive internet and online media use have resulted in various challenges for the associated businesses, such as hacking, defamation, unlawful transactions, etc. These offenses are referred to as cybercrimes. Since the turn of the century, the number of cybercrimes committed against Indonesian corporations has risen sharply, causing concern for the Indonesian government. Thus, the present study focuses on the prevalence of cybercrimes in Indonesian corporations, particularly on corporate law. Legal research was conducted for this study, and data were collected from various primary and secondary sources. Based on the findings of this study, the legal framework for cybercrimes in Indonesia consists primarily of the Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law and the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP), which are currently restricted to defamation, online threats, and other individual cybercrimes. However, other crimes relating to corporations, such as data protection, unlawful transactions, and others, are not highlighted in this legal framework, resulting in various obstacles to implementing cyber laws in Indonesia. This has also affected consumers' purchasing performance, influencing the affiliated businesses' social image. Nonetheless, this study has also provided various practical and theoretical implications. To safeguard data, privacy, and transactions in Indonesia, it is also suggested that a cybersecurity law be drafted."
The popularity of online shopping and cryptocurrency has contributed to drive the economy of darknet markets in recent years. These are often perceived to be conducive to (or may even facilitate) cybercrime related activities. It is, therefore, worthwhile to have a deeper understanding of how various darknet markets operate, so that researchers and law enforcement agencies can test and deploy appropriate countermeasures to fight against online crime. Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding the similarities and differences among darknet markets in different languages. This study aims to compare between darknet markets operating in English and Chinese. Data from three English and two Chinese darknet markets was collected. The gathered data is described, compared, and analysed in six main aspects: operation model and structures, product categories, market policies, payment methods, security mechanisms, and vendors' characteristics. Our datasets were collected during a seven-week period between 17 July and 30 August 2021, and they contain data from 384 vendors in the English darknet markets and 4,429 in the Chinese ones. The Chinese darknet markets generally seem to have more liberal policies than their English counterparts, as demonstrated by the variety and types of goods and services offered, many of which would have been banned in the English speaking ones. All darknet markets suffer from reputation issues. Cross-market actors are active, but they represent only a small proportion of the vendors observed in our study. In summary, our findings reveal key characteristics of darknet markets in two widely used languages. This information can provide useful insights for security researchers and law enforcement agencies in combating cybercrime.
This paper examines a predominantly Australian sample of computer crime offenders involved in fraud and/or unauthorised access. This paper focuses on the extent to which offenders are involved in organised crime, the nature of the relationship between co-offending, initiation and knowledge transmission, and how the online environment facilitates organised crime and co-offending. This qualitative analysis draws from interviews with self-identified offenders, law enforcement officers who investigate these offenses, and court documents, providing a unique understanding of organised crime involving computer systems.
The private nature of business creates opportunities for financial crimes. Convenience theory suggests that opportunity, accompanied by a willingness and motive, explains financial crimes. Newer technologies have created similar private environments, which allow for criminal behavior. For example, cryptocurrencies offer a new way of generating anonymous financial transactions. This paper explores criminal opportunity using cryptocurrency and convenience theory. Specifically, we test each convenience dimension - opportunity, willingness, and motive - using a sample of adults in the United States. We find all three dimensions explain online financial crimes. Opportunity, measured through any purchase of cryptocurrency is related to an increase in financial cybercrimes. Further, when motive is considered as greed or need, a need is more important than greed. The use of cryptocurrency increases certain opportunities for financial crimes. This may partially be attributed to the crimes themselves (e.g. pump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemes) but also to the general opportunity created through cyberspace.
Malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) remain one of the most common threats to cybersecurity. They are commonly spread through phishing, malware and spam. One popular way to detect malicious URLs is through blacklists. Blacklists maintain records of previously known malicious URL reputations. These lists are however shortcoming when there is need to detect newly generated malicious URLs. For that reason, modern research has resorted to training machine learning algorithms to detect malicious URLs. In this paper, we contributed towards the detection of malicious URLs using URL based features in a multiclass classification setting. We focused on three popular URL attack types which are phishing, spam and malware. Our work can be used as a supplementary tool in new or existing anti-phishing, anti-spam and anti-malware detection platforms. We compared the performance of the following ensemble learners: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). We evaluated the performance of some URL features that we referred to as our features. These included priority features like Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL divergence), bag of words segmentation and other word-based features. Results showed that our features performed better when compared to experiments we conducted without our features. We trained these algorithms on 126 983 URLs from benchmark datasets and all four learners returned an overall accuracy above 0.95.
Technology is an important issue affecting human life. We are experiencing conveniences in various fields in our lives along with the technological developments, especially with the emergence of the computers and internet concept. The virtual world provides opportunities for people who are inclined to crime. Since people from every walk of life can be easily reached especially in the internet environment, it has become easier to be a victim of a crime. The victimization is important in general, however, its effect on children is much greater than that of adults. Therefore, the sample of child victims of cybercrime in Turkey was examined using data obtained from Turkish Statistical Institute in this study. In order to examine crime and ways for combating the crime, the hot spots where the victims live mostly and the generic profile of the victims were discovered. The results obtained from the conducted analysis is expected to contribute significantly to the preventive and forensic processes carried out by the relevant authorities.
The rise of cyber-attacks has shown how cybercrime can be a lucrative business for cyber-criminals. This poses a major threat for organizations, individuals and nations, as these attacks can have devastating effects on all parties involved. With cyber-security infrastructures and enterprises becoming more complex, cyber-attacks are evolving rapidly and becoming even more evasive. For this reason, a proactive monitoring and detection system is necessary to ensure that cyber threats are identified and mitigated before cyber-criminals can exploit these threats. There have been many efforts made to harden and protect cyber-security environments against cyber-attacks. However, it is often difficult to implement mitigation measures against cyber-attacks without knowing what needs to be protected. To effectively monitor and detect cyber threats, various tools may be utilized to cover numerous aspects of the cyber landscape. Currently, a large proportion of the available tools focus on certain objectives that may not cover the entire cyber landscape. Thus, a centralized solution that consolidates a vast number of objectives could be advantageous. In this paper, we propose a cyber-security situational awareness solution that could potentially be used by defenders to protect network infrastructures and individuals from cyber threats. The solution aims to provide users with a centralized platform for vulnerability detection and management, information sharing and awareness, network and device monitoring. The proposed solution will proactively monitor the cyber threat landscape for vulnerable network devices, phishing attacks and leaked personal information in addition to detecting compromised public and non-public network devices. Furthermore, the proposed system will provide users with real time data presented in the form of an interactive dashboard to keep users informed about cyber-related trends. Finally, this solution will be able to produce high level and in-depth reports to support and improve the process of security audits and inform business decisions.
Scholars have expressed concerns over the effectiveness of formal sanctions in deterring cybercrime, particularly regarding computer intrusions and cyber attacks. Little empirical research, however, examines deterrence in the cyber world. This study examines the effects of perceived formal and informal sanctions, computer skill, online behaviors, cyber deviance, and beliefs on college students' willingness to commit cyber attacks against domestic and foreign targets, specifically defacing websites, compromising bank servers, and searching government servers. The study found that anticipated formal sanctions did not deter students from their willingness to commit caused-based cyber attacks, but that perceived informal sanctions did. The implications for future studies examining intentions to commit cause-based computer intrusions are explored.
Information security breaches are increasingly motivated by fraudulent and criminal motives. Reducing their considerable costs has become a pressing issue. Although cybersecurity has strong public good characteristics, most information security decisions are made by individual stakeholders. Due to the interconnectedness of cyberspace, these decentralized decisions are afflicted with externalities that can result in sub-optimal security levels. Devising effective solutions to this problem is complicated by the global nature of cyberspace, the interdependence of stakeholders, as well as the diversity and heterogeneity of players. The paper develops a framework for studying the co-evolution of the markets for cybercrime and cybersecurity. It examines the incentives of stakeholders to provide for security and their implications for the ICT ecosystem. The findings show that market and non-market relations in the information infrastructure generate many security-enhancing incentives. However, pervasive externalities remain that can only be corrected by voluntary or government-led collective measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Over the last two decades there has been a substantive increase in the number of cybercrime and digital forensic units in local and state police agencies across the US. There is, however, little research on the occupational responses of individuals serving in specialized roles within criminal justice agencies. Individuals tasked to these units are likely to encounter psychologically harmful materials on a regular basis due to the number of child pornography and sexual exploitation cases they are assigned. As a result, this study examined the experiences of vicarious trauma and coping behaviors of digital forensic examiners in a sample culled from across the country. The findings suggest that exposure to content involving crimes against children directly and indirectly increases the likelihood of trauma and incidence of coping strategies employed.
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a useful and relatively simple protocol for text based chat online, used in a variety of areas online such as for discussion and technical support. IRC is also used for cybercrime, with online rooms selling stolen credit card details, botnet access and malware. The reasons for the use of IRC in cybercrime include the widespread adoption and ease of use, but also focus around the anonymity granted by the protocol, allowing users to hide behind aliases that can be changed regularly. In this research, we apply authorship analysis techniques to be able to attribute chat messages to known aliases. A preliminary experiment shows that this application is very difficult, due to the short messages and repeated information. To improve the accuracy, we apply inverse-author-frequency (iaf) weighting, which gives higher weights to features used by fewer authors. This research is the first time that iaf has been applied to character n-gram models, previously being applied to word based models of authorship. We find that this improves the accuracy significantly for the RLP method and provides a platform for successful applications of authorship analysis in the future. Overall, the method achieves accuracies of over 55% in a very difficult application domain.
The cybercrime has evolved as the years ago and the criminals use different techniques to capture the victims. Researchers have devised various techniques to detect the cybercriminal. Hence, a new technology has to be used to detect the Cybercrime. From the literature, it is analysed that many researchers have used various techniques to detect the Cybercrime. In this paper, the performance evaluation of various cybercriminal detection techniques are analysed using cluster computing techniques and Matlab is used to determine their performance. In this paper, 25 attributes are analysed to detect the cybercriminal through various techniques such as Gaussian Clustering, K Means, Fuzzy C Means and Fuzzy Clustering. Some of the attributes are taken as varying attributes and some of the attributes are taken as the nonvarying attributes. The crime clusters and genuine clusters are determined. The reasons for choosing the various attributes and the various techniques are also given. The analysis is further strengthened by changing the number of attributes used in each technique i.e., 25 attributes, 15 attributes, 10 attributes and 5 attributes. The analysis is further continued by using 3/4 of total attributes, 1/2 of total attributes and 1/4 of total attributes. The efficiency and time complexity is determined. In the paper justification of a number of attributes selected in each technique is also given. The accuracy analysis is done by comparing with Gaussian Clustering with K Means Clustering technique, Fuzzy C Means, and user profile analysis. The attributes which are significantly contributing for identifying the criminals are determined in each technique.
Underground communication is invaluable for understanding cybercrimes. However, it is often obfuscated by the extensive use of dark jargons, innocently-looking terms like popcorn that serves sinister purposes (buying/selling drug, seeking crimeware, etc.). Discovery and understanding of these jargons have so far relied on manual effort, which is error-prone and cannot catch up with the fast evolving underground ecosystem. In this paper, we present the first technique, called Cantreader, to automatically detect and understand dark jargon. Our approach employs a neural-network based embedding technique to analyze the semantics of words, detecting those whose contexts in legitimate documents are significantly different from those in underground communication. For this purpose, we enhance the existing word embedding model to support semantic comparison across good and bad corpora, which leads to the detection of dark jargons. To further understand them, our approach utilizes projection learning to identify a jargon's hypernym that sheds light on its true meaning when used in underground communication. Running Cantreader over one million traces collected from four underground forums, our approach automatically reported 3,462 dark jargons and their hypernyms, including 2,491 never known before. The study further reveals how these jargons are used (by 25% of the traces) and evolve and how they help cybercriminals communicate on legitimate forums.
The paper consists of three-part. The first consideration with the concept of cyberspace, its main component, the issues of identity and authentication in the cyberspace, vulnerability, and threats, the concept in the second - 'Is it matter? - The researchers on the notion of cyberattack and the problem of establishing its source describe the phenomenon of cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyberterrorism, as well as some forms of cyberattacks. A significant part is devoted to cyberwar fundamentals of the military strategy, the mechanisms of checks, and the assessment of threats (cyber forces). The third part - 'What we can do?' An analysis of the development problems of cybersecurity space, its legal framework, the role in this process of the national governments and international organizations, issues of publicprivate partnership, and the paper mainly focus on cyberattacks and cybercrime prevention using advance technology
Hacking is now a widely discussed and known phenomenon, but remains difficult to define and empirically identify because it has come to refer to many different, sometimes incompatible, material practices. This article proposes genealogy as a framework for understanding hacking by briefly revisiting Foucault's concept of genealogy and interpreting its perspectival stance through the feminist materialist concept of the situated observer. Using genealogy as a theoretical frame, a history of hacking will be proposed in four phases. The first phase is the 'prehistory' of hacking in which four core practices were developed. The second phase is the 'golden age of cracking' in which hacking becomes a self-conscious identity and community and is for many identified with breaking into computers, even while non-cracking practices such as free software mature. The third phase sees hacking divide into a number of new practices even while old practices continue, including the rise of serious cybercrime, hacktivism, the division of Open Source and Free Software and hacking as an ethic of business and work. The final phase sees broad consciousness of state-sponsored hacking, the re-rise of hardware hacking in maker labs and hack spaces and the diffusion of hacking into a broad 'clever' practice. In conclusion, it will be argued that hacking consists across all the practices surveyed of an interrogation of the rationality of information technocultures enacted by each hacker practice situating itself within a particular technoculture and then using that technoculture to change itself, both in changing potential actions that can be taken and changing the nature of the technoculture itself.
Place management is central to Routine Activities Theory and proactive utilization of place managers is one of 25 Situational Crime Prevention techniques. Yet little is known about the effectiveness of using place managers to prevent cybercrimes. This paper uses a vignette experimental survey of 213 cybersecurity professionals to explore their perceptions of cybercrime prevention. We find that organizations that partner with and proactively utilize cybersecurity professionals as place managers are perceived as more effective in controlling cybercrimes than those organizations that do not specifically assign professionals to proactively prevent and control cybercrimes. We conclude that assigned cyberplace managers are more likely to use their cyber skills and knowledge than those who lack the time and space to utilize their cyber expertise.
Even though the crime rate in the United States has dropped since the U.S. President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice under President Johnson issued its report in 1967, the total number of serious crimes in the nation has increased, and public concern about the subject remains high. The 1960s Commission did not fully consider several major subjects that have emerged after it reported, including mental illness, immigration, cybercrime and other white collar crimes, indigent defense, crime victims, and evidence-based crime policy. Many observers believe that the need to deal with these subjects in addition to those discussed by other researchers in this volume warrants an examination of crime and justice by a new commission. Congress has considered proposals for such a study for nearly a decade, but they are yet to be acted on amid ideological disputes over other criminal justice issues. If Congress fails to establish a new commission, it is still possible that one could be formed with the support of state, county, and local governments, as well as with the support of private foundations.
Credit card skimming (electronic method of illegally capturing a victim's personal information by collecting data from the magnetic stripe of a credit or debit card) is a major problem in South Africa and millions of Rand are being stolen on a yearly basis. Cybercriminals make use of handheld card skimmers and place similar devices on Automated Teller Machines (ATM) to steal credit card data. Lately, the use of compromised Point of Sales (POS) devices, that are used to illegally obtain the credit card details of unsuspecting card users in South Africa, increased rapidly. The South African law enforcement cybercrime unit experienced problems with the confiscated, compromised POS devices. These confiscated POS devices that were found in the possession of arrested cybercriminals could not be used to prosecute them for credit card fraud, as the data on the devices were encrypted. In order to decrypt the data it was necessary to obtain the original password from the cybercriminal, something they were unwilling to disclose. To address this problem it was necessary to investigate the particular POS device and accompanying encryption/decryption software to find a method to decrypt the data on the POS device without access to the cybercriminal's original password. As there were no previous guidelines or reported solutions to the problem at hand, an exploratory research design was followed. The research led to a solution where a Windows application was developed to decrypt the cybercriminal's original password. This decrypted password was used to decrypt the encrypted stolen credit card data on the confiscated POS devices. With this software application the South African law enforcement cybercrime unit was able to successfully prove that the cybercriminal was in fact in possession of stolen credit card data. This led to the prosecution and conviction of several cybercriminals for committing credit card fraud in South Africa.
Cybercriminals can use a device compromised by malware for a plethora of purposes. Malicious intentions include the theft of confidential data, using the victim's computer to perform further criminal acts, or data ciphering to ask a ransom. Recently, deep learning is widely considered for malware detection. The main problem in the real-world adoption of these methods is due to their black box working mechanism i.e., the security analyst must trust the prediction without the possibility to understand the reason why an application is detected as malicious. In this article we discuss a malicious family detector, providing a mechanism aimed to assess the prediction trustworthiness and explainability. Real-world case studies are discussed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Background: Awareness of the need to address food defence is gaining pace in the food industry. Indeed implementing an effective food defence strategy is a key pre-requisite to comply with third party certification standards. There is however a knowledge gap with regard to the types of threat that fall within the scope of a food defence strategy and also how these issues can then be mitigated and where possible eliminated. Scope and approach: This research seeks to position food defence as a supply chain risk mitigation strategy and use case studies of real-world issues to frame the taxonomy of food defence threats. Key findings: In order to differentiate food defence threats (food attack) from wider food crime, the research postulates that food defence strategies needs to address intentional adulteration to gain personal attention, to gain financial reward through extortion or to gain attention for a particular cause or ideology i.e. food terrorism. More covert threats include sabotage, espionage, intellectual property theft, and cybercrime, including hacktivism. These threats can cause actual harm to individuals, members of certain populations and communities or to organisations. This can lead to large scale, economic, political or social unrest and disruption of the supply chain and thus fit within the scope of food defence activities. To inform food defence risk assessment and management processes, this taxonomy needs to be developed and accepted across the food industry so that threats can be consistently and effectively addressed and as a result consumers, industry partners, shareholders and also the organisation itself can be protected.
The spread of e-learning as an alternative to traditional or face-to-face education has faced many problems and challenges in general and ethical and legal challenges in particular. This study aims to measure students' awareness of the safe use of technology and its tools in e-learning that is consistent with ethical and legal standards. The study attempts to reveal the degree of awareness of students of the University of Jordan about electronic crimes related to e-learning and the legal procedures and penalties related to electronic crimes in e -learning. Quantitative research methods were used. A questionnaire was established and distributed to students enrolled in the following online courses: Ethics and Human Values, Communication Skills, and National Culture. Analysis of the data revealed that students had a high awareness about cybercrime due to the widespread use of the internet by students as it became an integral part of their daily lives. The degree of awareness of student about legal procedures and penalties related to electronic crimes in e-learning was medium. This indicates students' lack of awareness of the effectiveness of procedures and penalties for electronic crimes that can be applied in e -learning due to the rapid transition in the learning process at the University of Jordan from traditional learning to distance e-learning that was imposed during the Corona pandemic. Based on these findings, the study presented a set of recommendations that could be implemented to increase awareness and maximize the benefit of using e -learning.
The continued growth of Social Networking Services (SNS) has significant implications for computer and cybercrime management. In exploring the human side of security, studies have shown that any security response requires more than technical solutions. This is even more so as users are often seen as the main point of vulnerabilities for computer systems including SNS. This study seeks to probe the important values in understanding how to maximize end-user security and privacy concerns in SNS. The study applies the Value-focused Thinking methodology to uncover the SNS users' values in the form of their fundamental objectives/wishes, with an initial focus on developing economies in the Caribbean. The study found that privacy and integrity of SNS, security controls, corporate social responsibility and personal responsibility are fundamental in maximizing user security and privacy.
Protecting against interference is essential at a time when wireless communications are essential for sending large amounts of data. Our research presents a novel deep learning technique, the ResNeXt method and embedded Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model (RNT), rigorously developed for real-time phishing attack detection. Focused on countering the escalating threat of phishing assaults and bolstering digital forensics, our systematic approach involves SMOTE for managing data imbalance during initial data processing. The model's discriminative capability is improved, particularly in the feature extraction process, when autoencoders and ResNet (EARN) are integrated with feature engineering. The ensemble technique of feature extraction reveals crucial data patterns. At the core of our AI categorization is the RNT model, optimized using hyperparameters through the Jaya optimization method (RNT-J). Rigorously tested on real phishing attack datasets, our AI model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a substantial margin of 11% to 19% while maintaining exceptional computing efficiency. Furthermore, our model achieves 98% accuracy, low false positive/false negative values, and a statistical execution time with a mean of 36.99s, median of 35.99s, minimum of 34.99s, maximum of 41.99s, and a standard deviation of 1.10s. Moreover, it demonstrates superior accuracy with SMOTE (98%) and without SMOTE (83%) compared to other algorithms. This state-of-the-art AI study, which focuses on digital forensics, offers enhanced security and optimized productivity for businesses and industries, signifying a breakthrough in the continuing battle against phishing attempts. Through strengthening protection against interference in wireless communication, our AI research strives to amplify data accessibility, resilience, and trustworthiness in the face of cybersecurity threats within the organizational context.
This study proposes an integrated framework that considers letter-pair frequencies/combinations along with the lexical features of documents as a means to identifying the authorship of short texts posted anonymously on social media. Taking a quantitative morpho-lexical approach, this study tests the hypothesis that letter information, or mapping, can identify unique stylistic features. As such, stable word combinations and morphological patterns can be used successfully for authorship detection in relation to very short texts. This method offers significant potential in the fight against online hate speech, which is often posted anonymously and where authorship is difficult to identify. The data analyzed is from a corpus of 12,240 tweets derived from 87 Twitter accounts. A self-organizing map (SOM) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common features. Tweets grouped in a particular class displayed features that suggested they were written by a particular author. The results indicate that the accuracy of classification according to the proposed system was around 76%. Up to 22% of this accuracy was lost, however, when only distinctive words were used and 26% was lost when the classification procedure was based solely on letter combinations and morphological patterns. The integration of letter-pairs and morphological patterns had the advantage of improving accuracy when determining the author of a given tweet. This indicates that the integration of different linguistic variables into an integrated system leads to better performance in classifying very short texts. It is also clear that the use of a self-organizing map (SOM) led to better clustering performance because of its capacity to integrate two different linguistic levels for each author profile.
In this article, the authors successfully created two new plugins one for Autopsy Forensic Tool, and the other for Volatility Framework. Both plugins are useful for encoding digital evidences in Forensic Lucid which is the goal of this work. The first plugin was integrated in Autopsy to generate a report for the case of a Brute Force Authentication attack by looking for evidence in server logs based on a key search. On the other hand, the second plugin named ForensicLucidDeviceTree aims to find whether a device stack has been infected by a root-kit or not expression is implied by the previous statement. The results of both plugins are shown in Forensic Lucid Format and were successfully compiled using GIPC compiler.
Economic and financial crime is closely related to the changes and the development of societies. In this paper, we question whether the types of economic and financial crimes change as the society develops or not. For our purpose, we use the sample of 27 European Union member countries, for the 2005-2020 time period, which forms an unbalanced panel dataset. The main econometric method is represented by the Pooled OLS method for panel data. Our findings highlight that higher economic and sustainable development determines a reduction in the levels of corruption, shadow economy, and cybercrime. Additionally, we find that increased economic and sustainable development is related to higher levels of money laundering. These findings help governments to understand the way in which various types of economic and financial crimes unfold within different contexts of economic development, in order to implement specific policies for reducing the general level of crimes.
As the Internet and electronic mail continue to be utilized by an ever increasing number of users, so does fraudulent and criminal activity via the Internet and email increase. The negative effects of cybercrime activities on the use of the Internet for e-business and secure communications increased interest in studying the factors that motivate these criminals, their tactics and what can be done to mitigate their activities. The research in the area of email analysis usually focuses on two areas, email traffic analysis and email content analysis, but very poor in the area of visual analytics of emails. The paper presents the software for visualizing suspicious email messages based on the information provided in the email header (rather than the content of the email). This IP mapping tool, called MIPA, uses a Google Map to display the geographic position and integrates InfoDB, WhoIS databases, and the Google Maps API. Thus, the proposed work can be helpful for identifying and investigating suspicious email messages and also assist the investigators to get the information in time to take effective actions to reduce the criminal activities.
Cyber-attacks can significantly hurt an organization's IT environment, leading to serious operational disruptions, from simply damaging the first layers of IT security up to identity theft, data leakage and breaking down networks. Moreover, the dangers through which current cybercrimes practices affect organizations present a tendency of developing more rapidly that decision makers can assess them and find countermeasures. Because cyber threats are somewhat new thus a critical source of risks, within the context of the constantly changing IT environments (e.g. cloud services integration) organizations may not effectively implement and manage cyber threat risk assessment processes. This paper highlights the importance of designing effective security strategies and proactively addressing cybercrime issues as key elements within the organizational risk management approaches. Malware rises constantly in impact and complexity and has surpassed the traditional security model. One of the main ideas of the study is to present the main areas of risks related to cyber security to which an organization is subject to and provide a baseline of an analysis model that would adequately evaluate input data, rank priorities and represent the results and solutions to decrease these risks. The importance of this study is to increase awareness efforts and to highlight the critical importance of using the full extent of resources provided. Each member of an organization has a significant role in decreasing the exposure to the vulnerabilities created by cyber-attacks.
"This paper uses script analysis to model a low-skill-level SQL injection, a common form of website hacking Its contribution is to identify crime facilitators and potential stakeholders who can participate in the prevention of these types of crime up to the point of the criminal investigation. The data consists of a real judiciary crime case. The implications of this research are: 1) The police should consider ways of increasing the likelihood of and shortening the time taken for organisations to report cybercrime; 2) It may be possible and beneficial to detect low skill level domestic offenders among the mass of website hacks, and to concentrate on cutting their criminal career short via cooperation between authorities, business and the non-governmental sector. Moreover, increasing the awareness of young people re ding cybercrimes could potentially prevent an interest in a vulnerability search that would turn into a criminal act from forming in the first place."
The utilization of technology is vulnerable to misapplication of digital personal data either from public figures and citizens, one of them is in the form of deep fake technology. The manipulation of video technology in the form of deep fake globally has disrupted large scale disruptions in online networks in some countries such as the United States. The methods already spread to developing countries, which is Indonesia. The misapplication or manipulation of deep fake is not only intended for entertainment or to defame someone's reputation but on a large scale it is also used to form public opinion, divert issues and spread hoax news and cybercrime to incite cyberterrorism. Its existence in cyberterrorism is increasingly growing. This legal research discusses the manipulation of personal data into deep fake technology and its impact on cyberterrorism, political and legal resilience in Indonesia. The comparisons will also be applied to the United States. This research focuses more on preventive methods in dealing with deep fakes in Indonesia in cyberterrorism, namely aspects of counterterrorism, socialization and government literacy, development of preventive technology and strengthening of counter terrorism regulations that must be adjusted to several deep fake characteristics.
Credit and debit card data theft is one of the earliest forms of cybercrime. Still, it is one of the most common nowadays. Attackers often aim at stealing such customer data by targeting the Point of Sale (for short, PoS) system, i. e. the point at which a retailer first acquires customer data. Modern PoS systems are powerful computers equipped with a card reader and running specialized software. Increasingly often, user devices are leveraged as input to the PoS. In these scenarios, malware that can steal card data as soon as they are read by the device has flourished. As such, in cases where customer and vendor are persistently or intermittently disconnected from the network, no secure on-line payment is possible. This paper describes FRoDO, a secure off-line micro-payment solution that is resilient to PoS data breaches. Our solution improves over up to date approaches in terms of flexibility and security. To the best of our knowledge, FRoDO is the first solution that can provide secure fully off-line payments while being resilient to all currently known PoS breaches. In particular, we detail FRoDO architecture, components, and protocols. Further, a thorough analysis of FRoDO functional and security properties is provided, showing its effectiveness and viability.
A pronounced drop in crime, since the early 1990s, has encompassed every crime category tracked by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, including property crime. However, over the same period, the rates of online property crime (OPC) have been on the rise according to available evidence. We delineate the extent of our knowledge and data concerning cybercrime and identity theft and, using data from several nationally representative victimization surveys, offer an alternative view of property crime trends while pointing out the glaring gap in crime reporting and accounting in relation to the growing category of property crimes perpetrated online. In addition, we compare estimated costs of traditional property crime vs. OPC. Finally, we identify the main challenges for obtaining reliable data on OPC and discuss their implications, especially when applying the traditional methods of compiling crime statistics.
PurposeMalicious hackers are increasingly evolving with technology by developing advanced tools to infiltrate. They are looking at micro laundering via sites like PayPal or using job advertising sites, to avoid exposure. Micro laundering makes it possible to launder a large amount of money in small amounts through thousands of electronic transactions. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether the ethical hacking pedagogy is both a feasible and effective approach to prepare information security professionals of the future to combat black hat hacking and other forms of unethical conduct in the cyberspace. Design/methodology/approachThe paper will specifically explore the ethics and implications of teaching students how to hack. It examines the strengths and limitations of the ethical hacking pedagogy. The discussion will then form the basis for exploring whether ethical hacking pedagogy is logical and justifiable. FindingsThe research has examined whether the ethical hacking pedagogy is an initiative-taking and effective approach to preparing information security professionals. Teaching students to hack is the only feasible approach to preparing future cybersecurity professionals because such training will allow them to master technical skills necessary for penetration testing. Originality/valueA dominant theme that emerged from the research is the inability to evaluate students' intention and provide oversight after their graduation. Thus, professional networks and peer groups will play an instrumental role in sustaining students in an environment that fosters ethical conduct.
A B S T R A C T This article examines the emerging legal framework of encryption. It reviews the different categories of law that make up this legal framework, namely: export control laws, substantive cybercrime laws, criminal procedure laws, human rights laws, and cybersecurity laws. These laws are analysed according to which of the three regulatory subjects or targets they specifically address: the technology of encryption, the parties to encryption, or encrypted data and communications. For each category of law, illustrative examples of international and national laws are discussed. This article argues that understanding the legal framework of encryption is essential to determining how this technology is currently regulated and how these regulations can be improved. It concludes that the legal framework is the key to discerning the present state and future direction of encryption laws and policies. (c) 2021 Michael Anthony C. Dizon and Peter John Upson.

The emergence of a post-industrial information economy shaped by and around networked communication technology has presented new opportunities for identity theft. In particular, the accidental leakage or deliberate harvesting of information, via either hacking or social engineering, is an omnipresent threat to a large number of commercial organisations and state agencies who manage digital databases and sociotechnical forms of data. Throughout the twenty-first century the global media have reported on a series of data breaches, fuelling anxiety among the public concerning the safety and security of their personal and financial data. With concern outpacing reliable information, a reassurance gap has emerged between the public's expectations and the state's ability to provide safety and security online. This disparity presents a significant opportunity for a commercial computer crime control industry that has sought to position itself as being able to offer consumer citizens the antidotes for such ills. This paper considers how neoliberal discourses of cybercrime control are packaged, branded and sold, through an examination of the social construction of the Heartbleed bug. It demonstrates how security company Codenomicon masterfully communicated the vulnerability, the product of a simple coding error, through its name, a logo and an accompanying website, in turn shaping news coverage across the mainstream media and beyond.
The article focuses on the problem of promoting economic security in the emerging digital economy. The main emphasis is placed on solving the problems of preventing threats and cybersecurity risks in the era of rapidly developing digital technologies. The basic approaches are related to the construction of an infrastructure to combat cybercrime: formation, technological improvement of IT software and hardware, regulation, the use of finance and insurance, support for the media and the development of a safety culture. The results of this study can be applied to the design of information security systems at all levels.
"Online fraud is the most prevalent acquisitive crime in Europe. This study applies routine activities theory to a subset of online fraud, online identity theft, by exploring country-level mechanisms, in addition to individual determinants via a multi-level analysis of Eurobarometer survey data. This paper adds to the theory of cybercrime and policy debates by: (1) showing that country physical guardianship (e.g. cyber security strategy) moderates the effects of individual physical guardianship; (2) introducing a typology of online capable guardianship: passive physical, active personal and avoidance personal guardianship; (3) showing that online identity theft is associated with personal and physical guardianship; and (4) identifying public Internet access and online auction selling as highly risky routine activities. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of studying country-level effects on online identity theft victimization."
The authors analyze how ransomware as a service has changed cybercriminals' business models. Some mechanisms to defend against ransomware-related threats are also discussed.
The omnipresence of smart devices in many aspects of modern everyday life has helped to achieve an enormous level of automation, has ensured sustainable development, and improved quality of life. Over the last decade, such small and portable devices became cheap and easy to deploy in any kind of application. With the full range of versatile connectivity, such technological development also brings multiple challenges related to the security of infrastructure and data. Many individuals, companies, and states worldwide experience the previously unseen scale and scope of the attacks using novel approaches. All these smart applications have also increased the overall attack surface leading to multiple attack vectors available through vulnerabilities. Lack of standards, insufficient security awareness, and new technological landscape does not help either. Considering this, one needs to enhance forensics investigation methodologies, employ novel tools, combine threat intelligence, and integrate forensic readiness. Such measures will help to reduce the total cyber risk through a high level of preparedness for anticipated data-driven crimes in smart applications. We believe that this paper will help in bringing novel focus to existing digital forensics methodologies with a focus on smart applications.
Cloud computing is a relatively new model in the computing world after several computing paradigms like personal, ubiquitous, grid, mobile, and utility computing. Cloud computing is synonymous with virtualization which is about creating virtual versions of the hardware platform, the Operating System or the storage devices. Virtualization poses challenges to implementation of security as well as cybercrime investigation in the cloud. Although several researchers have contributed in identifying digital forensic challenges and methods of performing digital forensic analysis in the cloud computing environment, we feel that the requirement of finding the most appropriate methods to evaluate the uncertainty in the digital evidence is a must. This paper emphasizes on the methods of finding and analyzing digital evidence in cloud computing environment with respect to the cloud user as well as the provider. We propose a heuristic model for performing digital forensics in the cloud environment.
This paper deals with the difficult yet increasingly important MIS phenomenon of online child sexual exploitation (online CSE). Through the use of secondary and publicly available data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as primary data from a cybercrime police unit in the United Kingdom, this study takes a grounded theory approach and organizes the role that technologies and social actors play in shaping online CSE. The paper contributes to IS theory by providing a consolidated model for online CSE, which we call the technology and imagery dimensions model. This model combines the staging of the phenomenon and the key dimensions that depict how the use of technology and imagery both fuels and defuses the phenomenon. In informing the construction of the model, the paper extracts, organizes, and generalizes the affordances of technology and discusses the role of information systems in detecting online CSE.
The Dark Web is the hidden group of Internet sites that can only be accessed through specific software. The Dark Web enables private computer networks to communicate anonymously without revealing identifying information. Keeping Internet activity anonymous and private can be beneficial for both legal and illegal applications. Although it is used to evade government censorship, it is also deployed for highly illegal activity. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical analysis of the technical, legal, and ethical challenges to policing the DarkWeb. Themost significant recommendation identified in this paper is the need for stronger national cyber security strategies, increased awareness and use of the UN Cybercrime Repository, and greater support from intergovernmental organisations. This would help to contribute towards addressing many of the technical, legal and ethical challenges concerning the multi-jurisdictional nature of Dark Web investigations and lack of reliable data and resources while ensuring transparency and accountability. The recommendations proposed in this paper are restricted by certain limitations, therefore, further research is recommended into the field of digital policing and the Dark Web.
Cybercrime is a growing threat for firms and customers that emerged with the digitization of business. However, research shows that even though people claim that they are concerned about their privacy online, they do not act correspondingly. This study investigates how prevalent security issues are during a cyber attack among Twitter users. The case under examination is the security breach at the US ticket sales company, Ticketfly, that compromised the information of 26 million users. Tweets related to cybersecurity are detected through the application of automated text classification based on supervised machine learning with support vector machines. Subsequently, the users that wrote security-related tweets are grouped into communities through a social network analysis. The results of this multi-method study show that users concerned about security issues are mostly part of expert communities with already superior knowledge about cybersecurity.
Although phishing is a form of cybercrime that internet users get confronted with rather frequently, many people still get deceived by these practices. Since receiving phishing e-mails is an important prerequisite of victimization, this study focusses on becoming a phishing target. More precisely, we use an integrative lifestyle exposure model to study the effects of risky online routine activities that make a target more likely to come across a motivated offender. Insights of the lifestyle exposure model are combined with propensity theories in order to determine which role impulsivity plays in phishing targeting. To achieve these objectives, data collected in 2016 from a representative sample (n = 723) were used. Support was found for a relationship between both online purchasing behavior and digital copying behavior, and phishing targeting. Moreover, a relationship was found between all online activities (except for online purchasing behavior) and impulsivity. The present study thus suggests that especially online shoppers and users who often share and use copied files online should be trained to deal with phishing attacks appropriately.
Over the last twenty years, researchers have noted the range of violent and financial crimes performed by racial and ethnically-motivated actors. There is also substantial evidence demonstrating the ways that these actors utilize the Internet and various online communications platforms as a resource to recruit others and coordinate criminal activities. As virtually all aspects of modern interpersonal communication, commerce, and government depend on the Internet, these resources are a likely target for ideologically-motivated attacks. There is, however, little research considering the extent to which these resources have been targeted by racial and ethnically-motivated actors. This study attempted to address this gap in the literature through an analysis of the Extremist CyberCrime Database (ECCD), a unique open-source repository of cyberattacks performed against U.S. targets from 1998 to 2020. The findings demonstrate that cyberattacks performed by these actors are performed with less frequency than offline crimes. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of extremism are explored in depth.
A key issue facing cybercrime investigations is connecting online identities to real-world identities. This paper shows that by combining the Fringe-P3 method with a concealed information test, we can detect a participant's familiarity with their own email address, thus connecting their real-world identity to their online one. Participants were shown Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) streams of email addresses, some including their own email address (probe) or a target email address. Familiarity with the probe was accurately detected with significant results at the group level and for 7 of 11 participants at the individual level. These promising results demonstrate that the method can be successfully used to detect online identities. Factors that may affect how well an email address probe stands out in the RSVP streams are also discussed.
"Legal discussions about combatting global cyber threats often focus on international cybercrime arrangements or the application of the law of war to cyberspace. While these discussions are vital, policy-makers and scholars have not devoted adequate attention to creating a global legal framework to bolster the defenses of public and private infrastructure. Due to the interconnected nature of cyberspace and the cross-border impacts of attacks, inadequate security in one country could harm another. To build cyber strategies that rely in part on defense and deterrence by denial, governments should also focus both on the security of their systems and those of the private sector. Industry has been the target of some of the most destructive cyberattacks worldwide. Guiding international principles for a cyber security legal framework would help nations to build effective laws that reduce the likelihood of successful attacks, and increase resilience after attacks occur. Moreover, international collaboration on cybersecurity laws provides multinational companies with a more coherent legal framework. A patchwork of hundreds of different international security requirements is not only burdensome for companies, but it increases the potential for vulnerabilities, particularly if the company operates in countries with less stringent cybersecurity requirements. This paper sets out the need for nations to discuss common legal principles for promoting and regulating cybersecurity, similar to the privacy principles articulated in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Fair Information Practices in 1980. As a starting point for discussion, this paper suggests four goals of common international principles for cybersecurity law: (1) modernization of cybersecurity laws; (2) uniformity of legal requirements; (3) coordination of cooperative incentives and coercive regulations; and (4) supply chain security. Although cybersecurity laws will always vary, international coordination could improve their efficacy by providing some degree of consistency. A dialogue also could help policy-makers learn from other nations' cybersecurity successes and failures."
Cybercrime and threats of cyber security is much closer to connected home ecosystems futures that ever been expected. Most of the research effort is focused on the defense mechanisms of cooperate and national infrastructures, not realizing that one of the weakest link in this systems comes from the devices used within connected smart homes of now and the future. The paper forms part of the research to analyze implications and challenges of cybersecurity to smart devices in smart connected homes. We present some related background and motivation seen on the development and demand for seamless interconnectivity of smart devices to provide various functionality and abilities to users. The paper highlights the fact that while these devices provide more features and functionality, they also introduce new risks. Subsequently, current cybersecurity issues related to smart devices within connected homes discussed and analyzed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
"The South African government has invested substantially in IT to improve service delivery and benefit from the low cost of communication via e. g., the internet. However, cybercrime, lack of accountability and failure to evaluate e-developments remain a major concern to the society. The level of awareness of these risks in this sector appears to be low despite effort to address these challenges in government and private sector initiatives and conferences. The draft paper on information security (Dept of Public service and administration n.d. p2) and the CSIRT initiative clearly point to the fact that success in government electronic initiatives depends on effective information security management. The present study examined some of the factors inhibiting the recognition and reporting of losses from cyber-attacks on government departments in South Africa. A survey was conducted in the Western Cape Province. Forty responses were received and analysed using mixed methods. The results indicate that lack of clear guidance on how to calculate losses; lack of understanding of the legislation and knowledge of how it may assist in cubing cyber-crime; lack of training and creation of awareness of cyber-crime and lack of knowledge and capability to assess risks regularly are major factors inhibiting departments from recognising and reporting losses from cyber attacks."
Email spam is one of the primary means to facilitate the perpetration of internet fraud and the distribution of malware. The present research sought to examine the impact of routine activity theory at the national level on three forms of cybercrime perpetrated through email spam. A sample of 871,146 spam email messages sent in 2012 were divided into three categories: fraudulent emails, emails spreading malware, and non-serious spam emails. The measures were then aggregated by country and five measures of routine activity theory at the national level were tested for their impact on cybercrime among 120 nations. Concurrent with prior research, the results indicated that internet users per capita positively predicted all three forms of cybercrime. Unlike previous research, GDP presented a different relationship amongst all three outcomes: positive for spam, negative for fraud, and nonsignificant for malware. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.
Purpose The transformation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) into an important global economic player has been accompanied by digitalization that has also left it at a risk to cybercrime. Concurrent with the rise in technology use, the UAE fast became one of the most targeted countries in the world. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the UAE has tried to cope with accelerating levels of cyber threat using legislative and regulatory efforts as well as public- and private-sector initiatives meant to raise cybersecurity awareness. Design/methodology/approach The paper surveys the UAE's cybersecurity legislative, regulatory and educational initiatives from 2003 to 2019. Findings Because the human factor still remains the number one reason for security breaches, robust cyber laws alone are not enough to protect against cyber threats. Building public awareness and educating internet users about cyber risks and safety have become essential components of the UAE's efforts in building a more secure cyber environment for the country. Research limitations/implications The paper relies on English-language translations of primary sources (laws) originally in Arabic, as well as English-language studies from local media. This should not be considered a problem, as English is established as the language of business and commerce in the UAE. Practical implications The paper provides a detailed overview of the country's cybersecurity environment to guide and aide practitioners with risk assessment and legal and regulatory compliance. Originality/value The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the UAE's cybersecurity legislative, regulatory and educational environment. It also surveys government and private sector initiatives directed in protecting the country's cyberspace.
Ransomware attacks have increased in recent years and the impact on victims and society can be considerable. In order to develop effective measures against ransomware, it is important to understand how attacks are committed. However, most research on ransomware focuses on technical aspects or specific stages in the process. Less scientific research has been conducted on the entire process or the human involvement in attacks. Moreover, while crime scripts exist for other forms of cybercrime, a crime script for ransomware attacks is missing in the literature. The current study seeks to address this gap through a crime script analysis of ransomware attacks, using 44 court documents from Dutch and English-speaking countries and 10 expert interviews. The crime script analysis helps in understanding the actions taken in each stage of a ransomware attack and the behavior of and interaction between victims and offenders. It shows how the ransomware ecosystem has professionalized, with groups investing time, effort and money in the malware and infrastructure, outsourcing parts of the process and sometimes providing victims with customer service. Furthermore, it gives insight into facilitators, including the security risks that enable attackers in gaining access and cryptocurrency mixers or exchange services that facilitate money laundering. The findings have helped identify potential situational crime prevention measures, which are described in the discussion.
In the modern knowledge-information age, various information and communication technologies provide us with many benefits and at the same time, bring various side effects such as cybercrime. The number of cybercrimes is increasing gradually, and in particular, the number of digital sex crimes has been increasing recently. In addition, digital sex crimes are becoming increasingly violent, so national measures are needed. In this study, statistical data at the national level were used to investigate the overall characteristics of digital sex crimes in Korea. First, statistical analysis shows that the victims are mainly women in their teens and 20s. Typical types of digital sex crimes are distribution of illegal contents and illegal filming, the perpetrators are mainly unknown, and digital sex crimes were less often recognized by others and more often by the victims themselves. Based on these results, countermeasures against various digital sex crimes are suggested.
Almost all services and most of the traditional services are totally dependent on the digital environment. Few users are aware of the revolutionary nature of modern technology. We use day-to-day real-time access to existing digital services in our home country or we use social media (Some) to communicate with friends locally or elsewhere in the world. We can communicate with them in real time with text messages or even through real-time video feed. People have the choice of millions of movies to watch anytime, anywhere. Modern communications connect data centers and data networks of different continents together, enabling real-time communications throughout the world. We can order different goods from all over the world, pay invoices electronically and get the goods delivered to our door. Companies use the same channels of communication for daily communications, trading, sending invitations to tender and transferring money through banks in real time. As a result of the developments described above, people and systems produce huge amounts of data which needs to be processed and stored. However, technical solutions for all new service environments are not yet in line with international standards and their connections to telecommunications and service networks are very diverse. Technically outdated solutions and new technologies are used simultaneously. Future information and communication systems need to be designed and adapted to work in this challenging business environment where security threats and cybercrime are constantly present. Each function has its own service and communication needs depending on the user group. These groups include design and maintenance staff, financial management staff, telecom operators, service provider staff, virtual service providers and operators, administrative agents, citizens, manufacturers, banks, etc. To date no other technology apart from submarine cables systems has had such a strategic impact to our society while at the same time remaining so badly understood by the general population. This means that it is also a very tempting target for hackers and state actors. They seek access to the sea cables and networks connecting continents to each other.
Cyber-victimization has extensive economic and personal consequences for Internet users as well as negative conseqtiences for economies and the cyber infrastructure. This paper investigates the determinants of cyber-safety behaviors, particularly the factors associated with using anti-virus software in the general Internet user population, through a conceptual model about the determinants of non-digital preventive actions. We tested the Health Behavior Model, which considers perceptions about threats and expectations about behavior as the main determinants of health-related preventive behaviors, using a survey of Israeli Internet users 18 years old and older (N = 1850). Findings show that gender, age, education, seniority online and frequency of Internet use are basic determinants of anti-virus preventive behaviors. Nevertheless, similar to preventive health behaviors, beliefs about digital threats and actions to thwart them appear to account for more variance in anti-virus preventive behaviors than socio-demographic characteristics and Internet use. Our findings provide an innovative conceptual model and imply that the fight against cybercrime can take cues from health behavior studies demonstrating the role of perceptions and beliefs in reducing online threats. Furthermore, health behavior models are useful frameworks to conceptualize behavioral reactions to threats and to study cyber-safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
The illicit drugs website, Silk Road, presents an ideal case study for how online communication technologies are transforming crime. This article seeks to locate the offences committed via Silk Road within existing cybercrime literature, and presents a new criminological concept - the cryptomarket - to outline the contours of this new generation of online illicit marketplace. Cryptomarkets are defined as a type of website that employs advanced encryption to protect the anonymity of users. The article also analyses the implications Silk Road has for drug consumers and law enforcement, as well as the potential changes to drug distribution networks that are likely to occur if Silk Road and other cryptomarkets continue to assume a greater share of the global trade in illicit drugs. In conclusion, it is argued that while Silk Road presents a less violent alternative to conventional drug distribution networks, the risks posed by the rapid proliferation of cryptomarkets more generally are largely unknown and require further research.
Fake engagement services allow users of online social media and other web platforms to illegitimately increase their online reach and boost their perceived popularity. Driven by socio-economic and even political motivations, the demand for fake engagement services has increased in the last years, which has incentivized the rise of a vast underground market and support infrastructure. Prior research in this area has been limited to the study of the infrastructure used to provide these services (e.g., botnets) and to the development of algorithms to detect and remove fake activity in online targeted platforms. Yet, the platforms in which these services are sold (known as panels ) and the underground markets offering these services have not received much research attention. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper studies Social Media Management (SMM) panels, i.e., reselling platforms-often found in underground forums-in which a large variety of fake engagement services are offered. By daily crawling 86 representative SMM panels for 4 months, we harvest a dataset with 2.8 M forum entries grouped into 61k different services. This dataset allows us to build a detailed catalog of the services for sale, the platforms they target, and to derive new insights on fake social engagement services and its market. We then perform an economic analysis of fake engagement services and their trading activities by automatically analyzing 7k threads in underground forums. Our analysis reveals a broad range of offered services and levels of customization, where buyers can acquire fake engagement services by selecting features such as the quality of the service, the speed of delivery, the country of origin, and even personal attributes of the fake account (e.g., gender). The price analysis also yields interesting empirical results, showing significant disparities between prices of the same product across different markets. These observations suggest that the market is still undeveloped and sellers do not know the real market value of the services that they offer, leading them to underprice or overprice their services.
Nowadays, cloud computing has gained popularity because it provides a platform for pay-as-you-go services, including hardware, software, and operating environment. However, technological resources cannot only be shared, but allocated on-demand to various users. With the emerged rate of inevitable vulnerabilities and network crime activities all over the globe, cybercriminals targets cloud environments. So, the demand for digital investigation is increased drastically. These extreme challenges pose serious issues for the cloud investigation. It has an impact on the researcher community of digital forensics as well. The cloud service providers and customers have yet to establish adequate forensics capacity and support digital forensics investigations on cybercrime activities in the cloud. In this paper, we present a digital forensics-enabled cloud investigation framework. In addition, we survey previous related works based on existing cloud forensics practices, fog forensics, edge forensics, and law and highlight the significant role of cloud computing in digital forensics. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and limitations along with the future directions.
This paper provides a unique insight into the impact of computer misuse crime, such as hacking, denial of service attacks, ransomware and computer viruses/malware on individual and small and medium sized enterprises/organisation (SME/O) victims in the UK. Based upon in depth interviews with 52 (38 individual and 14 SME/O) victims it shows that these victims experience many of the impacts associated with other volume crimes. Building upon research on comparable offences the paper proposes eight categories of impact, which include:little or no impact, financial, disruption, psychological (which was broken down further), feelings of violation, loss of digital possessions, health and secondary impacts. The research highlights that although for some the impact is very minor, many experience much more extensive impacts, even when there is no financial loss and for some the impact was so severe it was compared to rape.
The relevance of the article is determined by the need to study money laundering in the digital economy since the gradual transition of the state economy to a digital format, including the emergence of electronic money, the spread of electronic banking and the use of other information technologies, leads to the emergence of new methods and schemes for money laundering, which requires the simultaneous identification of contemporary risks of counteracting this type of crime and the search for ways of improving such activity. The purpose of the article is to study the current status and to search for ways to improve the fight against money laundering in the digital economy. Abstract logical, comparative legal methods and critical analysis were used to achieve this goal. It has been found that advances brought by the digital economy were profitable tools for money laundering. The negative consequences of money laundering have been discussed, which updates the task of finding optimal areas for counteraction. It is concluded that such areas are as follows: improving the IT infrastructure of banks, establishing relationships between banks and law enforcement agencies, preventing cybercrime, improving the financial monitoring system, ensuring the interaction of financial monitoring entities and law enforcement agencies. The conclusions and provisions set forth in the article are aimed at improving state policy in the field of combating money laundering, taking into account the challenges of the digital economy.
Due to the spread of new methods of committing fraudulent actions using electronic devices, the problem arose to provide you with adequate characteristics of criminal law for the development of measures leading to counteracting such crimes. The objective of the article was to identify common methods in Ukraine of committing fraud using computers, to assess the characteristics of criminal law that these crimes have, and, in turn, to determine measures to counter them. Methodologically, this is a documentary investigation. The scientific novelty of the study's findings was to identify methods of performing fraudulent actions using electronic computers that will improve the legal qualification of crimes and affect the prosecution of persons guilty of committing such illegal actions. Measures to prevent such criminal offences were also developed. The results of the study help improve the work of law enforcement agencies in Ukraine, in determining recurrent methods of committing fraudulent actions using electronic means and their proper qualification, providing an opportunity to prosecute those who commit such illegal actions and develop ways for cybercrime research and prevention in general.
The ubiquity of instant messaging (IM) apps on smart phones have provided criminals to communicate with channels which are difficult to decode. Investigators and analysts are increasingly experiencing large data sets when conducting cybercrime investigations. Call record analysis is one of the critical criminal investigation strategies for law enforcement agencies (LEAs). The aim of this paper is to investigate cybercriminals through network forensics and sniffing techniques. The main difficulty of retrieving valuable information from specific IM apps is how to recognize the criminal' IP address records on the Internet. This paper proposes a packet filter framework to WhatsApp communication patterns from huge collections of network packets in order to locate criminal's identity more effectively. A rule extraction method in sniffing packets is proposed to retrieve relevant attributes from high dimensional analysis regarding to geolocation and pivot table. The results can support LEAs in discovering criminal communication payloads, as well as facilitating the effectiveness of modern call record analysis. It will be helpful for LEAs to prosecute cybercriminals and bring them to justice.
The cybersecurity of organizations is a subject of perennial concern as they are subject to mounting threats in an increasingly digitalized world. While commercial and charitable organizations have been the objects of cybersecurity research, social enterprises (SEs) have remained unexplored. As SEs have become increasingly important features of social and economic development, so their prominence as potential targets of cybercrime also increases. In order to address this knowledge gap, this article examines the factors that influence the cyber-preparedness of SEs in the U.K. Through the use of semistructured interviews with SE owner-managers, these factors are found to comprise the characteristics of the enterprise, the characteristics of the enterprise management, resource constraints, experience of cyberattacks, usage of IT, and awareness of cybersecurity schemes and resources. These insights provide valuable guidance for SE owner-managers, SE support agencies, and policy-makers when considering the cybersecurity of SEs. These findings are of immediate concern to SEs but also to other organizations that are engaged in partnerships with them as SEs may afford gateway opportunities to those with malicious intent.
The first months of the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed a surge of social engineering attacks. Although the pandemic is certainly not the first occurrence of socially disruptive circumstances that drive cybercrime, relevant academic scholarship has remained scarce. To fill this gap in literature and propose the analytical framework of mazephishing that places particular emphasis on the importance of credible social context in the online scam ecosystem, we carried out a content analysis of (N = 563) international news stories reporting on social engineering attacks. Our results indicate that criminals make heavy use of social context and impersonation to make scams seem more credible. Major themes used in the scam messages include health information, personal protective equipment, cures, financial relief and donations. Additionally, scammers diversify their use of mediums depending on the type of scam being perpetrated. Our analysis also shows a significant presence of principles of persuasion in the circulated scam attempts.
This study explores the relationship between cyberbullying perception, social support, internet use time, cybercrime victimization, and cybercrime perpetration for adolescents by using a nationally representative sample-the 2020 Cyber Violence Survey (N = 4,958, Grades 4-12) in South Korea. Findings include: (1) higher perceptions of cybercrime correspond to a lower likelihood of cyberbullying victimization, (2) greater support from parents and friends decreases the likelihood of cyberbullying victimization and perceptions, (3) Internet usage time is linked to increased chances of experiencing cyberbullying, (4) a significant positive relationship exists between cyber victimization and perpetration, and (5) levels of school management are associated with student cyber safety. Mitigating victimization via early intervention/prevention programs at school were discussed.
"The Internet has simplified daily life activities. However, besides its comfortability, the Internet also presents the risk of victimization by several kinds of crimes. The present article addresses the question of which factors influence cyber-dependent crime and how they vary between three kinds of cyber-dependent offences: malware infection, ransomware infection, and misuse of personal data. According to the Routine Activity Approach, it is assumed that crime is determined by a motivated offender, the behavior of the Internet user, and the existence of prevention factors. Our analyses were based on a random sample of 26,665 Internet users in two federal states in Germany, aged 16 years and older; 16.6 percent of the respondents had experienced at least one form of cyber-dependent victimization during the year 2014. The results indicate that individual and household factors, as well as online and prevention behavior, influence the risk of cyber-dependent victimization. Furthermore, the effects differ between the three types of offences. In conclusion, the risk of being victimized by cyber-dependent crime is not the same for anyone, but depends on multivariate factors according to the idea of Routine Activity Approach. However, in view of the fact that crime-related factors also matter, studying different cybercrime offences separately seems to be an appropriate research approach."
Online social networks (OSNs) provide a new dimension to people's lives by giving birth to online societies. OSNs have revolutionized the human experience, but they have also created a platform for attackers to distribute infections and conduct cybercrime. An OSN provides an opportunistic attack platform for cybercriminals through which they can spread infections at a large scale. We describe a category of malware (or attacks) known as socioware that exploits OSN environments for performing unauthorized and nefarious activities. Socioware can be an executable, an extension, an exploit code, etc., that conducts malicious operations in OSNs with serious impact on users. Furthermore, we discuss the socioware taxonomy highlighting the characteristics of socioware to illustrate the design and exploitation tactics of OSN malware. In contrast, insider threats (employees or contractors) are posing a grave threat to organizations, with a motivation to steal critical data and monetize it for financial gains. Insider threats have become a serious concern for many organizations today. We present a complete attack model to demonstrate how an insider threat exploits the online trust and confidentiality by transforming an OSN into a socioware distribution platform that infects other employees' systems. Finally, we discuss security defenses that can be adopted to defend against socioware.
The technological peculiarities of the Darknet as well as the availability of illicit items on the embedded marketplaces have raised heated debates in the media and keen interest by law enforcement and academics. In prior work, researchers have already investigated the infrastructure of Darknet platforms and the global distribution of Darknet market activity. In our work, we take a broader perspective by studying the Darknet as a regional, socio-economic and technological phenomenon. Our starting assumption is that there exist cross-country indicators that are related to Darknet market activity. We identify relevant indicators, and discuss their relationship to cybercrime from a theoretical perspective. We apply regression modelling and conduct a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to study the impact of the identified indicators on the number of items offered on the Darknet. We find that GDP per capita, the number of Bitcoin downloads per capita, the number of Tor relay users per capita and an education index correlate with market activity on Darknet platforms.
Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure by ideology-based hackers may have both significant financial costs and public safety consequences. Scholars have been increasingly using Sykes and Matza's (1957) techniques of neutralization to better understand the commission of various forms of cybercrime, including that of computer hacking. This study examines the effects of techniques of neutralization on college students' willingness to commit cyber attacks, specifically defacing websites and compromising financial and government servers, against both domestic and foreign targets. An overall techniques of neutralization scale significantly predicted being willing to commit all examined forms of cyber attacks even after controlling for peer behavior, computer skills, time spent online, and being male. The strongest support was found for the techniques of condemnation of the condemners and claim of entitlement. The implications of the findings for our understanding of why certain individuals are more willing to commit cyber attacks and the situational crime prevention efforts to remove excuses for offenders are both explored.
Cybercrime using big data is growing at an unprecedented rate, posing a serious threat to the Internet sector and global data. Traditional ways of mitigating cyber risks are becoming inadequate due to the more complex attack and offensive methods employed by cyber attackers, as well as the expanding importance of data-driven and intellect competitors. This work introduces new cyber attack detection (CAD) model in Big data that includes: Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection, and Detection, Mitigation. The preprocessing is done by using the improved class imbalance process. The variety of 3 features is extracted as flow-based features, improved entropy-based features, and higher-order statistical features. For feature selection, the Improved In-dependent component analysis (ICA) is used. Finally, the hybrid classifier includes LSTM and Deep Max out (DMO) in the detection process. Once the presence of an attack is detected, mitigation takes place via the pro-posed Bait mitigation process. The weights of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are optimized by using the Self -Enhanced Sea Gull Optimization (SE-SGO) model. The maximum accuracy has been achieved (0.94) for the suggested approach which is 38%, 14.6%, 7.36%, 38.7%, and 10.5% superior to the other existing approaches like HC + SGO, HC + SSOA, HC + DHOA, HC + DOX, and HC + FF, respectively.
Spam is characterized as unnecessary and garbage E-mails. Due to the increasing number of unsolicited E-mails, it is becoming more and more crucial for mail users to utilize a trustworthy spam E-mail filter. The shortcomings of spam classifier are defined by their increasing inability to manage large amounts of relevant messages and to effectively detect and effectively detect spam messages. Numerous characteristics in spam classifications are problematic. Given that selecting features is one of the most often used and successful techniques for feature reduction, it is a crucial duty in the identification of keyword content. As a result, features that are unnecessary and pointless yet potentially harm efficiency would be removed. In this study, we present SGNN-CNN (Semantic Graph Neural Network With CNN) as a solution to tackle the difficult task of mail identification. By projections E-mails onto a graph and by using the SGNN-CNN model for classifications, this technique transforms the E-mail classification issue into a graph classification challenge. There is no need to integrate the word into a representation since the E-mail characteristics are produced from the semantic network. On several open databases, the technique's effectiveness is evaluated. Some few public databases were used in experiments to demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed approach for classifying E-mails. In term of spam classification, the performance is superior to state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods.
Sextortion, a portmanteau of sexual and extortion, is the threat to distribute intimate, sexual materials unless a victim complies with certain demands. Cyber sextortion is part of a larger continuum of image-based sexual offending in which images are used for harm. Despite the serious nature of this crime, there exists a dearth of empirical knowledge of sextortion. This article employed a qualitative content analysis of media articles and court documents to explore the crimes of 152 cyber sextortion offenders. Characteristics of offenders, victims, demands, and methodology were identified and synthesized to generate a qualitative understanding of offenders who employed cyber sextortion. The results revealed four different themes of offenders based on crime characteristics: minor-focused cyber sextortion offenders, cybercrime cyber sextortion offenders, intimately violent cyber sextortion offenders, and transnational criminal cyber sextortion offenders. The diverse nature of cyber sextortion has implications for crime control policies. Certain offenders are more likely to be apprehended and prosecuted depending on the crime victim and methodology. In addition, there has been a lack of legislative action targeting cyber sextortion, which limits legal recourse available for victims. We discuss the contribution of this work to the broader literature on cyber sextortion and address some of the challenges that this crime presents to the criminal justice system.
"Cyber-dependent offending, i.e. criminal behaviour reliant on computing and the online domain, has been reportedly associated with particular characteristics and motivations such as being young, male, autistic and motivated by challenge. These associations are anecdotal however and empirical evidence is limited. The present study investigated reasons for engaging or declining to commit cyber-dependent offending in cyber-skilled non-offenders (n = 175) and offenders (n = 7) via an online survey measuring cyber-dependent criminally. The potential role of autism and autistic traits was also considered. Qualitative interviews about motivations for offending were carried out with the offenders. The cyber-dependent offenders reported seven main reasons for engaging in cyber-dependent offending: (1) lack of understanding; (2) entertainment; (3) peer influence; (4) experience and career; (5) anonymity and risk perception; (6) life events; and (7) morals. Twenty-nine (approximately 17 %) of the non-offenders had been asked to engage in cyber-dependent offending but had declined. Their reasons and motivations for declining to commit cyber-dependent offences were compared with the cyber-dependent offenders reasons and motivations for engaging in cybercrime. Seven main reasons for declining to offend were identified: (1) moral principles; (2) perception of risk; (3) fear of consequences; (4) not wanting to; (5) wanting to adhere to the law; (6) behaviour being too complicated; and (7) price being too low. Implications for practise are discussed."
One of the most important practices of cybercrime investigations is to search a network traffic history for an excerpt of traffic, such as the disclosed information of an organization or a worm's signature. In post-mortem investigations, criminals and targets are detected by attributing the excerpt to payloads of traffic flows. Since it is impossible to store the high volume of data related to long-term traffic history, payload attribution systems (PASs) based on storing a compact digest of traffic using Bloom filters have been presented in the literature. In these systems, querying the stored digest for an excerpt results in a low number of suspects instead of certain criminals. In this paper, we present a different PAS which is based on simple and widespread digital signal processing techniques. Our traffic digesting scheme has been inspired by DSP-based compression algorithms. The proposed payload attribution system, named DSPAS, not only results in a low false positive rate but also outperforms previous schemes in response to wildcard queries which are essentially applicable for complex excerpts, such as the signature of polymorphic worms. Our theoretical analysis and practical evaluations show that the DSPAS results in a significantly lower false positive rate and also a lower processing time for wildcard queries in comparison to previous works. Moreover, our PAS can prevent a malicious insider from evading the PAS by its ability to find strings similar to a queried excerpt.
"Human trafficking is a worldwide crisis and the U. S. Department of State's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report highlights the critical need to address this issue both home and abroad. Today, it is estimated as many as 27 million people around the world are victims of trafficking into the sex trade and other forms of servitude known as modern slavery or trafficking in persons. Trafficking in persons and human trafficking has been used by the U. S. Department of State and other governmental and multinational organizations as umbrella terms for the act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. Recent research reflects that the exploitation of people through trafficking, is being channeled heavily through cyber activity such as Internet service, local bulletin board service, or any device capable of electronic data storage or transmission including social networking sites like Craig's List, Facebook, MySpace, and email instant messaging, text messaging, fictitious employment advertisements, immigration assistance and online bride websites. The goals of the research include: (1) identifying some of the key present challenges in cybertrafficking investigations, (2) understanding the impact of cybertrafficking in our society, locally, nationally and globally; and (3) assessing the role of the private sector in regulating the Internet for human trafficking activity. Presently, human trafficking scholarship and education is in its early stages particularly as it relates to understanding victim protection and assistance, technological, evidentiary and surveillance issues and international legal frameworks for the prevention of human trafficking. Greater awareness and education is needed to assist in the challenges faced by our Executive and Legislative Branches as they address important issues of national security and the growing incidence of cybercrime. This paper will introduce common law legal doctrines, procedural and evidentiary tools, forensic analysis, and case studies that will assist in creating a deeper understanding of the impact of cyber activity on the human trafficking industry in the effort to find greater solutions for the prevention, prosecution and protection of the innocent from the growing incidence of cyber activity as it relates to human trafficking around the globe."
Along with the development of video streaming, the increasing number of pirated video websites has caused unprecedented damage to copyright holders and potential security risks to their users. Though many efforts have been made to take down pirated video websites, they are still emerging by utilizing evading approaches like Fast-Flux domains and Cybercrime-as-a-Service(CaaS) tools. In this paper, to detect pirated video websites, we propose a Third-party Enhanced Pirated Video Website Classification Network (TEP-Net), which integrates both semantic features and relationship information between websites and their third-party services. More specifically, we apply CNN-BiLSTM-Attention to explore both character-level and domain-level textual embedding and utilize relationship information by constructing statistical features in classification. The experiment shows that TEP-Net achieves a significant performance compared with existing methods. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of the CaaS behind pirated video websites. Our research can help the security community fight against video piracy more precisely and effectively.
Despite the focus on knowledge risks in the literature, a limited number of studies have empirically examined technological knowledge risks in terms of digitalization, old technologies, and cybercrime as moderating variables in the relationship between work-life balance and job performance. To address this gap, this paper investigated the moderation effects of technological knowledge risks on the relationship between work-life balance and job performance during the pandemic period in employees of cooperative credit banks. A quantitative approach that involved gathering surveys was adopted. Applying PLS-SEM, the empirical findings revealed that technological knowledge risks have a significant impact on the relationship between work-life balance and job performance. Additionally, this research encourages managers to create and maintain a healthy work environment that promotes valuable employees' job performance while also evaluating the use of new technological advances and their related risks.
This article addresses the fundamental conceptual challenges which face the development of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) in the post-Lisbon Treaty era. It argues that Onuf-style constructivism is a valid lens with which to examine the development of the AFSJ to date, involving as it does the development of a shared understanding by practitioners, predominantly law enforcement and prosecution professionals, within the structures provided for them, in order to develop a completely new area of law and practice. While this approach will continue to need to be deployed in the development of further new operational areas, such as cybercrime, a new approach is now required, that of constitutionalism. A variety of forms of constitutionalism are then examined in order to establish their suitability as a mode of analysis for these developments.
"Given the complexity and velocity of the interactions among vastly heterogeneous elements on the Internet; the colossal amounts of information generated and exchanged, coupled with the increasingly evasive nature of new forms of electronic crimes, as well as the relative immaturity of current Digital Forensics tools, Law Enforcement Agencies are easily outpaced and overwhelmed with the types of electronic crimes experienced today. In this paper, we describe the architecture of a comprehensive automated Digital Investigation platform termed as the Live Evidence Information Aggregator (LEIA). It makes use of the strong points of hypervisor technologies, large scale distributed file systems, the resource description framework (RDF), peer-to-peer networks, and innovative collaborative mechanisms in order to introduce a level of speed, accuracy and efficiency to match up with the imminent age of massively distributed cybercrime in the context of Internet of Things."
Botnets account for a substantial portion of cybercrime. Botmasters utilize darkweb marketplaces to promote and provide their services, which can vary from renting or buying a botnet (or parts of it) to hiring services (e.g., distributed denial of service attacks). At the same time, botnet takedown attempts have proven to be challenging, demanding a combination of technical and legal methods, and often requiring the collaboration of a plethora of entities with varying jurisdictions. In this article, we map the elements associated with the business aspect of botnets and utilize them to develop adaptations of two widely used business models. Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components. We aim to shed light on new takedown vectors and incentivize takedown actors to expand their efforts to methods oriented more toward the business side of botnets, which could contribute toward eliminating some of the challenges that surround takedown operations.
Cloud storage service allows users to store their data online, so that they can remotely access, maintain, manage, and back up data from anywhere via the Internet. Although helpful, this storage creates a challenge to digital forensic investigators and practitioners in collecting, identifying, acquiring, and preserving evidential data. This study proposes an investigation scheme for analyzing data remnants and determining probative artifacts in a cloud environment. Using pCloud as a case study, this research collected the data remnants available on end-user device storage following the storing, uploading, and accessing of data in the cloud storage. Data remnants are collected from several sources, including client software files, directory listing, prefetch, registry, network PCAP, browser, and memory and link files. Results demonstrate that the collected remnants data are beneficial in determining a sufficient number of artifacts about the investigated cybercrime.
This paper describes the impacts of criminal activities based on the nature of the crime, the victim, and the basis (whether short-term or long-range/term) of the impacts of cybercrime on Internet. Recently many countries are facing numerous cyber threats including DoS (and DDoS), malware, website defamation, spam and phishing email attacks. Due to these cybercrimes evolution, identifying and assessing security risk is crucial to access data from new technologies, and also trying to understand how technologies can be abused. Therefore, there is a need to develop a special cyber security risk assessment model to tackle over these cyber threats. In this paper, we propose to utilize Fuzzy Inference Model (FIS) to produce risk assessment result based on the four risk factors which are: vulnerability, threat, likelihood and impact to specify the range of risks that can threaten any entity and try to solve such issues to proposed entities. We have performed various analyses on this factors and finally, our evaluation results show the viability of our proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
This paper addresses the relative lack of studies concerning characterisation of online crime in court judgements. The goal was to outline the social context of computer-dependent online offences in Lithuania as enacted in court practice. It is an internationally relevant example of the applied outcomes of local legislation enacting the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. We focused on four key themes to explore how computer-dependent online crime was defined in court practice: offences, offenders, victims, and sentences, bound by the concept of selectivity in criminal justice. A mixed-methods approach was utilised to analyse 265 court judgements in online offence cases in Lithuania from the years 2017-2021. The results revealed that the majority of the offences were computer-enabled rather than computer-dependent, carried out by persons with previous experience in the criminal justice system seeking financial gain.
The availability of sophisticated technologies and methods of perpetrating criminogenic activities in the cyberspace is a pertinent societal problem. Darknet is an encrypted network technology that uses the internet infrastructure and can only be accessed using special network configuration and software tools to access its contents which are not indexed by search engines. Over the years darknets traditionally are used for criminogenic activities and famously acclaimed to promote cybercrime, procurements of illegal drugs, arms deals, and cryptocurrency markets. In countries with oppressive regimes, censorship of digital communications, and strict policies prompted journalists and freedom fighters to seek freedom using darknet technologies anonymously while others simply exploit it for illegal activities. Recently, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence augmented a tool that can be used to expose illegal activities behind the darknet. We studied relevant literature reviews to help researchers to better understand the darknet technologies, identify future areas of research on the darknet and ultimately to optimize how data-driven insights can be utilized to support governmental agencies in unraveling the depths of darkent technologies. This paper focuses on the use of internet for crimes, deanonymization of TOR-services, darknet a new digital street for illicit drugs, research questions and hypothesis to guide researchers in further studies. Finally, in this study, we propose a model to examine and investigate anonymous online illicit markets
Information and communication technologies are widely used in modern conditions. Individuals, businesses and public administration system try to adapt to the new game rules as quickly as possible, to introduce modern information systems, to use the Internet in life, in production and transactions, purchases, promotion of goods and services. However, new information artifacts threaten each business entity well-being and lead to information leak, software malfunction, cyber-espionage, an open information attack or direct financial losses due to cybercrime in banking operations. The purpose of the scientific article is the identification of existing information threats to economic security, their economic consequences and possible ways to prevent them through the state policy implementation. A detailed analysis of the sources of scientific information allowed to establish the role and place of information threats in the economic security threats system, to create a model of information threats influence on economic security and to form a differentiated approach to the implementation of state policy for reducing economic security information threats.
Computer and Internet technology has become a vital part of a daily life for many as it has brought many enhancements to the quality of many individuals' lives. Although advances in computer and Internet technology are utilised by many people for various respectable reasons, at the same time it has become a tool in the hands of cybercriminals for various nefarious reasons. Cybercrime has become a fast-growing type of crime where more and more criminals exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity of the Internet to perpetrate various criminal activities that have no border. This paper examines the phenomenon of cyber crime and the difficulties and challenges that it presents due to the way that it is being regulated in England and Wales. A major focus will be placed on the area of hacking. To this end, the effectiveness of the Computer Misuse Act in dealing with cybercrimes both in the past and in the future will be examined.
The article deals with new technologies for countering cyber attacks that can be aimed at destabilizing public order, large-scale disruption of communication systems, intimidation by imposing one's will, including on power structures, and, in general, pose an increased threat to the national and information security of the state. Particular attention is paid to blockchain technology, which allows to hide funds aimed at financing criminal, including terrorist activities, including in the information space. Also in the article, the authors present generalized research results as part of the implementation of the RFBR scientific project No. 18-29-16175 Blockchain technology to counter the risks of cyberterrorism and cyber extremism: a criminal-legal study. Modern cybercrime dictates new challenges to the state, which can no longer be responded to within the space of a single state. Today, the issue of legislative regulation of the interaction of states to prevent cybercrime with the use of new technologies is an acute issue. The most important aspect of the new forms of countering cybercrime is the decentralization of users of anonymous proxy server systems. And if earlier security agencies still had available loopholes for direct access to the user's IP address, now everything has become much more complicated and a comprehensive analysis of the traffic of a particular user is necessary. Scientists also point out that network attacks can contain malicious embedded code, the use of backdoors and much more. Such attacks can be triggered from anywhere in the world because of a computer with a masked IP-address. A new type of warfare, even cyber warfare, is changing the landscape of war itself. This type of war eliminates the need to have physically capable armed forces and requires the need for forces with strong technical capabilities, such as computer skills. Many countries, including Russia, have come to understand that this is a problem and are actively pursuing policies to address it in order to mitigate threats.
"Cyber threats such as identity deception, cyber bullying, identity theft and online sexual grooming have been witnessed on social media. These threats are disturbing to the society at large. Even more so to minors who are exposed to the Internet and might not even be aware of these threats. This paper describes a brief overview of different developments on cybersecurity methodologies that have been implemented to ensure safety of minors on social media, particularly; online sexual grooming. A desktop survey on Machine Learning technologies that have used to detect online sexual grooming is presented in this paper. The aim is to consolidate most of the work done in the past by scholars in this area of research, in order to develop insights on various algorithms that have been proposed and the reported performance results."
Today, there are many scams on the internet, including predatory publishing, predatory journals and predatory conferences. These fraudulent activities are a form of cybercrime and cause reputational damage to science and scientists in many disciplines. These activities also threaten the integrity of modern health care and scholarship. In this paper, the scamming associated with predatory conferences is discussed. An email is the most typical way researchers are asked to sign up for a predatory conference.Nurses, midwives and others are warned of the potential for lost funds, time, effort and emotional investment if they invest in a non-existent conference or one of low quality. Vigilance is needed by experienced scholars and clinicians, as well as early career researchers and graduate students, to try to detect when conferences are not what they seem. Suggestions are given here to try to determine if the conference is predatory. Understanding the extent of predatory conferences and evidencing clear strategies to reduce the likelihood of being scammed are much needed. While many papers are published about this problem, there is a lack of research, and this is an opportunity for nurses and midwives to consider for their next project. Action is clearly needed to reduce or eliminate these scams, and individuals and groups afected by predatory conferences need to report this to their institutions who must refer the mater to law enforcement agencies.
Background: Amidst the rise of e-commerce, there has been a proliferation of illicit online pharmacies that threaten global patient safety by selling drugs without a prescription directly to the consumer. Despite this clear threat, little is known about the key risk characteristics, central challenges and current legal, regulatory and law enforcement responses. Sources of data: A review was conducted of the English literature with search terms 'online pharmacies', 'Internet pharmacies', 'cyber pharmacies', 'rogue pharmacies', and 'e-pharmacies' using PubMed, JSTOR, and Google Scholar from 1999-2005. Areas of agreement: Illicit online pharmacies are a rapidly growing public health threat and are characterized by a number of complex and interrelated risk factors. Areas of controversy: Solutions are varied and are of questionable utility in the face of evolving technology that enables this form of transnational cybercrime. Growing points: Legal, regulatory and technology solutions must address the entire illicit online pharmacy ecosystem in order to be effective. Areas timely for developing research: There is a critical need to build international consensus, conduct additional research and develop technology to combat illicit online pharmacies.
"Traditional security education often focuses on teaching theoretical concepts but lacks hands-on experience. However, many aspects of modern security, especially in the incident management domain, cannot be taught in the abstract; they must be experienced. Our Cyber Defence Centre (CDC) allows us to train students in a simulated environment where they gain skills in detecting attacks, closing vulnerabilities, and responding to security breaches in a realistic but safe setting."
Along with the use of the internet, awareness regarding the privacy of the user data is also increasing slowly and gradually but at a comparatively slower rate than that of cybercrime. At present in the market, there are many such operating systems available that are secured and leave the minimum number of traces which makes it difficult to retrieve or obtain any kind of data from that system after carrying out the forensics of that machine. In this research, acquisition, and analysis of random access memory (RAM), of such secured operating systems, is performed and potential artefacts related to the activities are identified, that the operating systems leave in the memory of the system which can be further submitted in the court of law as evidence in case of a crime being committed using such security providing technology.
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current state of empirical knowledge pertaining to online risk and cybercrime relating to people with intellectual disabilities (ID). Design/methodology/approach This narrative review summarises, synthesises and critically evaluates the current literature and state of knowledge and offers suggestions for extending current knowledge and practice. Findings Evidence regarding risk for people with ID is limited but growing. Existing findings highlight that: risk may increase contingent upon higher levels of sociability, loneliness, anxiety and depression, poorer insight, judgement, discrimination and ability to detect deception online and reduced experience and life opportunities; people without ID perceive high online risk for people with ID, which may lead to gatekeeping restrictions and controlling digital access; restriction may potentially impede online self-determination, participation and development by people with ID; and experience of risk may enhance awareness, independence and resilience in managing future online risk amongst people with ID. Further research work is needed in this area to enhance understanding of risk experience and effective support strategies. Originality/value This review of current knowledge has highlighted the necessity for more research to better understand the propensity for engagement in different risky online behaviours and to better inform support practices to help people with ID to manage risk whilst maintaining digital inclusion."
Online forums serve as offender convergence settings for cybercriminals, but it is unknown whether all cybercriminal networks use forums. Important questions are how cybercriminals meet, how cybercriminal networks develop and what this means for the criminal capabilities of these networks. To gain insight into these questions, we analysed 18 criminal investigations into phishing and malware networks and developed four models of growth. Social ties still play an important role in the origin and growth of the majority of networks. Forums, however, also play a significant role in a number of networks, for example, to find suitable co-offenders or to get into contact with enablers. Criminals with access to forums are able to increase criminal capabilities of their network relatively quickly.
One of the common examples of cybercrime are identity theft and violating of intellectual property that commonly occur in social media. Authorship attribution (AA) techniques are used to extract and use several features of the text in order to identify the original author. These features are used to differentiate the writing style of one author from others. Several machine learning methods have been used to identify the AA using different languages. Few studies were conducted for Arabic AA. This paper aims to investigate the performance of deep learning-based artificial neural network (ANN) for identifying the attribution of authors using Arabic text. The applied model helps protect users in social media from identity theft and violating of their intellectual property. The experiments of this study used a dataset that includes 4,686 Arabic texts for 15 different authors. The performance of the deep learning method was compared with several machine learning methods. The experimental results showed the superior performance of deep learning for AA in Arabic language using different evaluation criteria such as F-score, accuracy, precision, and recall measures.
In the era of global communication, the Internet has become an integral part of our daily life activities. Information sharing over the Internet has significantly changed the way of communication among the millennials all over the globe. Consequently, this has led to security and privacy issues as the millennials are willing to their share personal information online without any hesitation. In Malaysia, more than 30 Malaysians fall victim to cybercrime daily due to the misuse of personal information. However, factors of why millennials share such information are yet to be discussed. The aim of this study is to assess the factors that influence information sharing behavior among millennial in Malaysia based on their demographic profile. The research uses quantitative approach, and administrates survey to one hundred and eighty respondents of a groups of millennial. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is used to identify the factors that influence information sharing behavior among millennial in Malaysia. The result indicates that subjective norms which is the individual's perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform a given behavior is the most influential factor that contributes in online information sharing behavior among millennial group in Malaysia. The study then suggested several countermeasures to be taken in information security education to address issues in information sharing behavior among millennial in Malaysia.
An increase in digitization is giving rise to cybercrimes. The existing network protocols are insufficient for collecting the required digital evidence of cybercrime, which eventually makes the process of forensic investigation difficult. In the current scenario of network forensics, the investigator with current capabilities can reach only up to the ISP. This is not primary evidence. Currently, available tools work only at the network layer. In this work, we propose a protocol that ensures tracking up to the true source by collecting beforehand forensically sound evidence. The proposed protocol can collect target data from the device in the form of a device fingerprint with the help of an agent process. The proposed methodology will help in proving non-repudiation, which is a well-known challenge in forensic cases. The fingerprint evidence generated by the proposed method has the capability of not getting obsolete even if the criminal tries to destroy evidence. The fingerprinting technique deployed uses a hash tree and generates evidence in such a way that this fingerprint can act as legal evidence. The security validation of the proposed system is done using the BAN logic. Formal verification is performed using the AVISPA tool. The system has been implemented as a prototype and hosted on AWS.

"Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) involves three key behaviors: the non-consensual taking or creation of nude or sexual images; the non-consensual sharing or distribution of nude or sexual images; and threats made to distribute nude or sexual images. IBSA is becoming increasingly criminalized internationally, representing an important and rapidly developing cybercrime issue. This paper presents findings of the first national online survey of self-reported lifetime IBSA perpetration in Australia (n = 4053), with a focus on the extent, nature, and predictors of perpetration. Overall, 11.1% (n = 411) of participants self-reported having engaged in some form of IBSA perpetration during their lifetime, with men significantly more likely to report IBSA perpetration than women. With regard to the nature of perpetration, participants reported targeting men and women at similar rates, and were more likely to report perpetrating against intimate partners or ex-partners, family members and friends than strangers or acquaintances. Logistic regression analyses identified that males, lesbian, gay or bisexual participants, participants with a self-reported disability, participants who accepted sexual image-based abuse myths, participants who engaged in or experienced sexual self-image behaviors, and participants who had a nude or sexual image of themselves taken, distributed, and/or threatened to be distributed without their consent were more likely to have engaged in some form of IBSA perpetration during their lifetime."
Cybercrimes have evolved, in a very short period of time, from just an interesting phenomenon to one of the biggest threats that our society has yet faced. The term of cybercrime is not something new anymore, due to the inconstant evolution of the technologies that were initially meant to ease our life. However, any new progress brings with it different challenges and sometimes some new criminal behaviors. Due to the apparition of the cyber criminality on the global stage, different types of institutions from the filed of law enforcement started to develop programs to fight this new - at that time-type of threat. An interesting and actual challenge is also addressed to the main institutions from the area of Public Order and National Security, and especially to the ones meant to train the professionals in these fields. This challenge is referring to the way to train the personnel related to the cybercrimes from the point of view of prevention and fighting this phenomenon. However, another problem is for the Academic institution-such as Romanian Police Academy, in case of this article 's subject - to be able to provide a minimal level of knowledge in this field for future police officers, which, of course, will be involved (or at least intended to be involved) in different typologies of crimes than the ones related to digital environment. Current paper is intended to provide a brief image of current realities of this type of training, as well as the main advantages and disadvantages of the current educational system in accordance with the real needs from an operational point of view.
This article examines the modus operandi of phishing for information related to bank accounts in The Netherlands, by composing crime scripts based on 93 Dutch court transcripts. The analysis resulted in two overarching crime scripts of phishing. In the first crime script, criminals aim to steal victims' ATM cards and pin numbers. In crime script two, criminals aim to steal victims' personal data and verification codes-codes needed to confirm transfers-in order to deposit money from the bank accounts of victims to third parties' bank accounts, or to persuade victims to do this themselves. In conclusion, the modus operandi of phishing has not changed much in recent years, meaning that interventions targeting bottlenecks in the crime script can still very well be implemented. Furthermore, the results indicate that the modus operandi seems to become less technical, contradicting the idea that digitalization leads to more technically sophisticated phishing methods.
With the increasing threat of cybercrime, there is also an increasing need for the forensic investigation of those crimes. However, the topic of systematic preparation on the possible forensic investigation during the software development, called forensic readiness, has only been explored since recently. Thus, there are still many challenges and open issues. One of the obstacles is ensuring the correct implementation. Moreover, the growing volume and variety of digital evidence produced by the systems have to be put into consideration. It is especially important in the critical information infrastructure domain where potential cyberattacks could impact the safety of people. In this paper, we present research towards verification of forensic readiness in software development, with a focus on digital evidence they produce, to assist the advancement of this research domain. Furthermore, we formulate a process that serves a template for designing, developing, and refining a verification method for forensic-ready software systems.
Romance scams involve cybercriminals engineering a romantic relationship on online dating platforms for monetary gain. It is a cruel form of cybercrime whereby victims are left heartbroken, often facing financial ruin. We characterize the literary landscape on romance scams, advancing the understanding of researchers and practitioners by systematically reviewing and synthesizing contemporary qualitative and quantitative evidence. The systematic review establishes influencing factors of victimhood and explores countermeasures for mitigating romance scams. We searched 10 scholarly databases and websites using terms related to romance scams. The methodology followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines: a total of 279 papers were screened. One hundred seven papers were assessed for eligibility, and 53 were included in the final analysis. Three main contributions were identified: common profile features and techniques used by romance scammers, countermeasures for mitigating romance scams and factors predisposing an individual to become a scammer or a victim. Despite a growing corpus of literature, the total number of empirical or experimental examinations remained limited. The paper concludes with avenues for future research and victimhood intervention strategies for practitioners, law enforcement and the industry.
Cyber-attacks can be more dangerous than guns and tanks. This statement was made by Junker in his speech in the EU State of the Union in 2017 and reflects the extreme importance of this phenomenon. The increasing variety of devices that can access to Internet has contributed to the overall growth of internet users, in all kinds of places and circumstances. These devices are now part of our lives and we use it for everything. As the number of devices and tasks that we do with it are growing, more prone we are to cyber-attacks. As well, as the number of user's victim of these attacks are increasing, the general concerns about cybercrime are growing too. The growing list of cybercrimes includes crimes that have been made possible by computers, such as network intrusions and the dissemination of computer viruses, as well as computer-based variations of existing crimes, such as identity theft and terrorism which have become as major problem to people and nations. In this context, the European Union is leading the effort to regulate the defence against cyber-threats in both normative/legal and strategic levels. This reality is also very present in Portugal, where there is a sense of lack of control and capacity to combat this kind of threats. In this article, we present the European Strategy and Legislation for Cybersecurity and how this strategy applies and involves Portugal.
The article's purpose is the criminological and forensic characteristics of the forms of embezzlement of funds by the use of information technology and international and foreign experience in combating this destructive phenomenon. The object of this article is the relationship that arises in connection with the implementation and counteraction to theft in the field of information technology. The authors used various methods of scientific cognition to write this work. In particular, historical, observation, generalization, comparison and analogy, statistical, analytical, and others. The article emphasizes that the emergence and rapid development of new information technologies do not always positively affect criminals because criminals can transform positive qualities into crime. In particular, crimes of embezzlement through the use of information technology are now widespread. This article has tried to provide a criminological description of the three main forms of cybercrime against money: carding, phishing, and embezzlement committed using NFC technology. In addition, emphasis was placed on the importance, role, tasks of computer and technical expertise in the investigation of embezzlement dedicated through the use of information technology. The importance of implementing international conventions and the positive experience of foreign countries in combating the embezzlement of funds committed through the use of information technology.
In recent years, the number of cyber attacks, virus carriers, and cybercrime on maritime transport facilities has increased significantly. The emergence of new types of maritime vessels, such as autonomous vessels, dependent entirely on information and communication technologies used for passengers, cargo and baggage transportation, requires legal regulation of relations in this area. Therefore, ensuring cybersecurity in maritime transport and the need to adopt appropriate legal norms, standards and measures at both the international and national levels to manage maritime cyber risks are considered one of the most relevant topics for maritime transport. There is no single, systematic integrated approach, unification of requirements and rules in cybersecurity's sphere of maritime transport [15]. In this regard, the authors analyze the issues of ensuring cybersecurity in maritime transport, the legal basis of security: some international documents and national legal acts, regulating cybersecurity in maritime transport, will be considered, as well as the main question of how they are able to meet modern requirements for ensuring cybersecurity in maritime transport.
Cybercriminals operate in obscurity to avoid detection of their illegal deeds. This fact makes studying them more difficult. Many cybercriminals meet in illicit online market places such as carding forums. The forums are often visible, but the actual transactions are carried out in private messages beyond view. However, there is no honor among thieves, and sometimes a carding forum server database will be hacked and leaked to the public. Existing research has been conducted on such leaked databases, but much of it is quantitative, rather than offering any qualitative interpretation into the nature of the forum user base. This research sought to analyze two such leaked carding forum databases by applying hierarchical clustering of 10,714 registered user accounts, grouping users based on 19 variables consisting of comment history style, site engagement activity, and explicit status markers. The results yielded 16 categories of users from four different domains composed of general consumers, location-based consumers, producers, and an other category. Following categorization, qualitative analyses were conducted to further shed insight into the nature of the two forums.
As technology has changed people's lives, criminal phenomena are also constantly evolving. Today's digital society is changing the activities of organized crime and organized crime groups. In the digital society, very different organized crime groups coexist with different organizational models: from online cybercrime to traditional organized crime groups to hybrid criminal groups in which humans and machines `collaborate' in new and close ways in networks of human and non-human actors. These criminal groups commit very different organized crime activities, from the most technological to the most traditional, and move from online to offline. They use technology and interact with computers for a variety of purposes, and the distinction between the physical and virtual dimensions of organized crime is increasingly blurred. These radical developments do not seem to be accompanied by a new criminological theoretical interpretive framework, with a definition of organized crime that is able to account for the changes that digital society brings to organized crime and generate modern research hypotheses. This article proposes the concept of digital organized crime and the spectrum theory of digital organized crimes, to be embedded within a current, revised sociological theory of the organization of crime and deviance in digital society (a new theory of digital criminal organizing) and argues that the study of digital organized crime will increasingly require a digital sociology of organized crime. Criminologists are called upon to work in this direction.
Modern information technology (IT) is well developed, and almost everyone uses the features of IT and services within the Internet. However, people are being affected due to cybersecurity threats. People can adhere to the recommended cybersecurity guidelines, rules, adopted standards, and cybercrime preventive measures to largely mitigate these threats. The ignorance of or lack of cybersecurity knowledge also causes a critical problem regarding confidentiality and privacy. It is not possible to fully avoid cybercrimes that often lead to sufficient business losses and spread forbidden themes (disgust, extremism, child porn, etc.). Therefore, to reduce the risk of cybercrimes, a web-based Blockchain-enabled cybersecurity awareness program (WBCA) process is introduced in this paper. The proposed WBCA trains users to improve their security skills. The proposed program helps with understanding the common behaviors of cybercriminals and improves user knowledge of cybersecurity hygiene, best cybersecurity practices, modern cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and trends. Furthermore, the proposed WBCA uses Blockchain technology to protect the program from potential threats. The proposed program is validated and tested using real-world cybersecurity topics with real users and cybersecurity experts. We anticipate that the proposed program can be extended to other domains, such as national or corporate courses, to increase the cybersecurity awareness level of users. A CentOS-based virtual private server is deployed for testing the proposed WBCA to determine its effectiveness. Finally, WBCA is also compared with other state-of-the-art web-based programs designed for cybersecurity awareness.
"Ransomware attacks are a fast-growing cybercrime that pose a large threat to society. These attacks can result in losing significant amounts of data and money for their victims. Many industries such as aerospace, governmental organizations, etc., have been targeted in the last couple of years. This paper examines the recent attack incidents by one of the famous ransomware groups, Babuk, on the aerospace industry and a police department. It provides an in-depth analysis of the methodology of the attack and examines the impact at a local and global level. A total of 250 gigabytes of data were stolen from one of the victims, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Babuk first had to gain access by infiltrating the system to attack the victims successfully; however, there is no clear evidence on how this was specifically done. Babuk likely gained access by scanning for vulnerable ports in the victim's system, sending employees a phishing email with a malicious link, or cracking passwords that the victim used for admins in their system. After gaining access, Babuk had to maintain access while stealing and encrypting files. Finally, they demanded ransom from the victims and threatened to post the sensitive data if the ransom was not paid. The attack has impacted not only specific organizations but also public security officials. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the possible attack methodologies and defense strategies against such ransomware attacks. The defense strategies may include changing government policies, regulating cryptocurrency, and adhering to FBI-listed advice."
Phishing attacks are a common feature of online communications. Phishing attacks impact many actors, from individual victims to the corporate and government agencies whose brands are deceptively used. Responding to phishing is big business, driving software security markets, influencing eCommerce uptake and participation, and protecting corporate brand and image. Yet despite its insidious nature and the penetration of phishing throughout online communications, little is known regarding phishing attacks and their responses. This paper is a response to this key knowledge gap, analyzing the tasks and mapping the social interactions of a phishing attack and the associated response. To achieve this, the research team adopted a multi-method approach in examining the underlying functions and interactions involved in a phishing attack and its response by deliberately 'taking the phishing bait', interviewing a sample of individuals that had unwittingly responded to phishing attacks, and engaging with organisations that took response measures to such events. This multi-actor engagement provided critical observations and content about the victim experience and interactions with those responsible for the attacks. The research is highly novel in its application of Work Domain Analysis (WDA) to gain an understanding of the functional structure of phishing attacks and the online transactional environment they target as a sociotechnical system. By examining the functional properties of interactions within the research context, the paper provides a unique perspective of phishing and the inter-linkages and dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction from the initial 'baiting' to the achievement of overall system objectives by cybercriminals. The findings provide opportunities to enhance phishing prevention and detection methodologies, improve individual resilience to such attacks, and pave the way for future efforts in applying sociotechnical systems methods to the cybercrime environment.

Cybercrime is all about the crimes in which communication channel and communication device has been used directly or indirectly as a medium whether it is a Laptop, Desktop, PDA, Mobile phones, Watches, Vehicles. The report titled Global Risks for 2012, predicts cyber-attacks as one of the top five risks in the World for Government and business sector. Cyber crime is a crime which is harder to detect and hardest to stop once occurred causing a long term negative impact on victims. With the increasing popularity of online banking, online shopping which requires sensitive personal and financial data, it is a term that we hear in the news with some frequency. Now, in order to protect ourselves from this crime we need to know what it is and how it does works against us. This paper presents a brief overview of all about cyber criminals and crime with its evolution, types, case study, preventive majors and the department working to combat this crime.
Entrepreneurs are likely to be victims of ransomware. Previous studies have found that entrepreneurs tend to adopt few preventive measures, thereby increasing their chances of victimization. Due to a lack of research, however, not much is known about why entrepreneurs lack self-protective behaviors and how they can be encouraged to change said behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explain, by means of an extended model of the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the motivation for entrepreneurs using protective measures against ransomware in the future. The data for our study were collected thanks to a questionnaire that was answered by 1,020 Dutch entrepreneurs with up to 250 employees. Our Struc-tural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that entrepreneurs are more likely to take preventive measures against ransomware if they perceive the risk of ransomware as severe (perceived severity), if they perceive their company as being vulnerable (perceived vulnerability), if they are concerned about the risks (affective response), and if they think that the people and companies around them expect them to apply preventive measures (subjective norms). However, if entrepreneurs think that they are capable of handling the risk (self-efficacy) and are convinced that their adopted preventive measures are effec-tive (response efficacy), they are less likely to take preventive measures. Furthermore, for entrepreneurs that outsource IT security, the significant effect of perceived vulnerability and subjective norms disap-pears. The likelihood of entrepreneurs protecting their business against ransomware is thus influenced by a complex interplay of various motivational factors and is partly dependent on the business' character-istics. Based on these findings, we will discuss security professionals' prospects for increasing the cyber resilience of entrepreneurs, thus preventing cybercrime victimization.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Within the past decade, Africa has witnessed a phenomenal growth in telecommunications and Internet penetration. Statistical data indicates that Internet users in Africa grew from 4,514,400 million people in 2000 to 167, 335, 676 million people in June 2012[1]. Naturally, the spread of telecommunications technologies and Internet penetration in African states has also raised concerns for cybersecurity at both national and regional levels. At the regional level, the Africa Union Commission and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa has developed a draft regulatory framework on cybersecurity which is known as the Draft Convention for the Establishment of a Credible Legal Framework for Cybersecurity in Africa. The Convention is intended to harmonize the laws of African states on electronic commerce, data protection, cybersecurity promotion and cybercrime control. This paper briefly discuses some of the defects of the Draft Convention with respect to the promotion of cybersecurity and cybercrime control. The paper also offers some suggestions on possible remedies that would enhance the effectiveness of the Draft Convention towards promoting cybersecurity in Africa.
While extant literature on privacy in social networks is plentiful, issues pertaining to information security remain largely unexplored. This paper empirically examines the relationship between online victimisation and users' activity and perceptions of personal information security on social networking services (SNS). Based on a survey of active users, we explore how behavioural patterns on social networks, personal characteristics and technical efficacy of users impact the risk of facing online victimisation. Our results suggest that users with high-risk propensity are more likely to become victims of cybercrime, whereas those with high perceptions of their ability to control information shared on SNS are less likely to become victims. The study shows that there is a negative and statistically significant association between multipurpose dominant SNS (e.g. Facebook, Google +) usage and victimisation. However, activity on the SNS for knowledge exchange (e.g. Linkedln, Slogger) has a positive and statistically significant association with online victimisation. Our results have implications for practice as they inform the social media industry that protection of individual information security on SNS cannot be left entirely to the user. The importance of user awareness in the context of social technologies plays an important role in preventing victimisation, and social networking services should provide adequate controls to protect personal information.

Cybercrime continues to cause increasing threat to business processes, eroding stakeholders' trust in Internet technologies. In this article, we explore how six dominant algorithmic trust positions facilitate cognitive processing, which, in turn, can influence an organization's productivity and align its values and support structures for combating cybercrimes. This conceptual paper uses a cognitive perspective described as a throughput model. This modeling perspective captures several dominant algorithmic trust positions for organizations, providing a new, and powerful approach which seeks to enhance our understanding of the cognitive representation of decision-making processes. These trust positions are rational-based trust, rule-based trust, category-based trust, third-party based trust, role-based trust, and knowledge-based trust. Finally, we provide conclusion and implications for future research.
This study examines the rising incidence of phishing and its impact on the survival of corporate organisations in Cross River State, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey research design which allows the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative methods is applied. Questionnaires were distributed to 1074 respondents purposively selected from 18 financial institutions, 4 telecommunication network providers and 2 manufacturing companies, while in-depth interviews were conducted on 13 participants across the selected corporate organisations. The presentation of data is done using frequency distribution tables and chart while the qualitative data were content analysized. The study concludes that phishing is on the increase and corporate organisations in Cross River State are losing fortunes to the activities of phishers. This development the study reveals has forced organisations to lose trade and competitiveness, destroying consumers' confidence in the organisations and their products/services, among others. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that corporate organisations should invest more resources and time in sensitizing staff and customers on how to stay safe from cybercriminals and their villainous activities. Also, customers should verify the authenticity of the correspondence between them and the various organisations they transact business with, before responding to such mails, especially when it involves divulging sensitive information about themselves.
The prevalence and nonstop evolving technical sophistication of exploit kits (EKs) is one of the most challenging shifts in the modern cybercrime landscape. Over the last few years, malware infections via drive-by download attacks have been orchestrated with EK infrastructures. Malicious advertisements and compromised websites redirect victim browsers to web-based EK families that are assembled to exploit client-side vulnerabilities and finally deliver evil payloads. A key observation is that while the webpage contents have drastic differences between distinct intrusions executed through the same EK, the patterns in URL addresses stay similar. This is due to the fact that autogenerated URLs by EK platforms follow specific templates. This practice in use enables the development of an efficient system that is capable of classifying the responsible EK instances. This paper proposes novel URL features and a new technique to quickly categorize EK families with high accuracy using machine learning algorithms. Rather than analyzing each URL individually, the proposed overall URL patterns approach examines all URLs associated with an EK infection automatically. The method has been evaluated with a popular and publicly available dataset that contains 240 different real-world infection cases involving over 2250 URLs, the incidents being linked with the 4 major EK flavors that occurred throughout the year 2016. The system achieves up to 100% classification accuracy with the tested estimators.
The modern malware poses serious security threats because of its evolved capability of using staged and persistent attack while remaining undetected over a long period of time to perform a number of malicious activities. The challenge for malicious actors is to gain initial control of the victim's machine by bypassing all the security controls. The most favored bait often used by attackers is to deceive users through a trusting or interesting email containing a malicious attachment or a malicious link. To make the email credible and interesting the cybercriminals often perform reconnaissance activities to find background information on the potential target. To this end, the value of information found on the discarded or stolen storage devices is often underestimated or ignored. In this paper, we present the partial results of analysis of one such hard disk that was purchased from the open market. The data found on the disk contained highly sensitive personal and organizational data. The results from the case study will be useful in not only understanding the involved risk but also creating awareness of related threats.
Although a relatively simple form of hacking, website defacement can have severe consequences both for the websites that are attacked and the reputation of their owners. However, criminological research has yet to fully explore the causes and correlates of website defacement. We consider whether variables derived from routine activity theory can be applied to understanding website defacement. Specifically, using a sample of websites that were targeted by hackers in 2017 across the world, we examine the relationship between a country's structural characteristics and the frequency of website defacement reported for the country. We find that website defacements are less likely to occur in the presence of capable guardianship (strong military presence) and more likely to occur when certain measures of target suitability are present. Additionally, using hackers' self-reported valuations of potential targets, we separate defacements into two groups, and examine whether websites targeted for political reasons have different correlates than websites targeted for recreational reasons. Findings reveal that recreational defacements are deterred by capable guardianship (strong military presence) and are influenced by certain measures of target suitability while political defacements are not.
Cybercrime against critical infrastructure such as nuclear reactors, power plants, and dams has been increasing in frequency and severity. Recent literature regarding these types of attacks has been extensive but due to the sensitive nature of this field, there is very little empirical data. We address these issues by integrating Routine Activity Theory and Rational Choice Theory, and we create a classification tool called TRACI (Taxonomy for Risk Assessment of Cyberattacks on Critical Infrastructure). We take a Design Science Research approach to develop, evaluate, and refine the proposed artifact. We use mix methods to demonstrate that our taxonomy can successfully capture the characteristics of various cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. TRACI consists of three dimensions, and each dimension contains its own subdimensions. The first dimension comprises of hacker motivation, which can be financial, socio-cultural, thrill-seeking, and/or economic. The second dimension represents the assets such as cyber, physical, and/or cyber-physical components. The third dimension is related to threats, vulnerabilities, and controls that are fundamental to establishing and maintaining an information security posture and overall cyber resilience. Our work is among the first to utilize criminological theories and Design Science to create an empirically validated artifact for improving critical infrastructure risk management.
Cybercriminals deploy botnets for conducting nefarious operations on the Internet. Botnets are managed on a large scale and harness the power of compromised machines, which are controlled through centralized portals known as C&C panels. C&C panels are considered as attackers' primary operating environment through which bots are controlled and updated at regular intervals of time. C&C panels also store information stolen from the compromised machines as a part of the data exfiltration activity. In this empirical study, we analyzed many over 9000 C&C web URLs to better understand the deployment and the operational characteristics of HTTP-based botnets.
We describe the roadmapping method developed in the context of the CyberROAD EU FP7 project, the aim of which was to develop a research roadmap for cybercrime and cyberterrorism. To achieve this aim we build on state-of-the-art methodologies and guidelines, as well as related projects, and adapt them to the specific characteristics of cybercrime and cyberterrorism. The distinctive feature is that cybercrime and cyberterrorism co-evolve with their contextual environment (i.e., technology, society, politics and economy). This poses specific challenges to a roadmapping effort. Our approach could become a best practice in the field of cybersecurity, and could also be generalised to phenomena that exhibit a similar, strong co-evolution with their contextual environment. In this chapter, we define our route to developing the CyberROAD research roadmap and contextualise it with an example of Enterprise 2.0.
"Tax policies across countries reveal disparities that cybercriminals can exploit, taking advantage of the development of the e-commerce sector. There is a dearth of studies that could show how to strengthen cybersecurity measures within tax systems to safeguard against data breaches and fraud and ensure the integrity of tax revenue to protect consumers from the indirect costs of cybercrime-driven tax evasion. This research employed normative juridical and comparative approaches and a qualitative research design to gain a comprehensive understanding of e-commerce taxation issues. It examined current regulations and compliance challenges in electronic commerce taxation policies and focused on addressing security challenges in Indonesia's digital economy. The study revealed that electronic transactions are already defined under various laws of Indonesia namely Law Number 11 of 2008 concerning Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE Law) which regulated all kinds of acts using computers, computer networks, and/or other electronic media; Law Number 7 of 2014 concerning Trade defines which was a law to regulate a;; types of trading through Electronic Systems; and the Directorate General of Taxes Number SE-62/PJ/2013, regarding Affirmation of Tax Provisions on E-commerce Transactions for taxation purposes. The study enriches readers' understanding of legislative regulations and the effectiveness of e-commerce taxation in Indonesia. The study implies that Indonesia has a well-structured tax framework that has the potential to enhance both the capacity and adherence of e-commerce businesses to taxation standards."
Technology has inevitably evolved, driving significant human progress in every sphere of life. Amid this technological development, laws and regulations have been enacted to control offences relating to global advances in technology, including in Bangladesh. Bangladesh government has taken many initiatives to make the country digital. But in Bangladesh, the cyber-related laws are full of shortcomings and the customary laws are extremely outdated and most of the laws do not fit the era of ICT. Although Bangladesh government passed the ICT Act and the Digital Security Act to control cybercrime, the country's existing laws for fighting the menace are inadequate due to certain limitations. The article examines contemporary cyber legislation and legal issues in Bangladesh, together with the customary laws and existing policies, with a view to identifying their inadequacies and challenges. This article makes use of secondary data, i.e., books, journals, customary laws, acts etc.
The number of cybercrimes has grown considerably in recent years and now poses a serious threat for the national security of states, information systems and personal data of citizens. The reasons for this considerable increase in cybercrime are the change of global policy, the special military operation, and the restrictions connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors examine the importance of using special knowledge and artificial intelligence (AI) in the investigation of cybercrimes. They research the concept of a cybercrime, and analyze the ideas of scholars on strengthening the counteraction to such criminal activities, which have been spreading rapidly in recent years. The authors conclude that cybercrimes are understood as socially dangerous unlawful behavior, carried out with the use of information technologies and inflicting considerable damage on the economic and reputational interests of people, organizations and the state. They present a classification of the most common types of cybercrimes and key methods of carrying them out. They also analyze the research discussion on the contents of special knowledge, which allows the authors to conclude that in modern legal conditions AI, being a new form of special knowledge, requires a new understanding in view of the use of this knowledge in criminal proceedings. Taking into consideration that this format includes machine self-learning, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, etc., the authors attempt to outline how they can be used for solving complex criminalistic tasks that require a preliminary analysis of large volumes of forensically relevant information, identification of images and regularities, and argumentation of making organizational-procedural decisions. The authors examine the cyberspheres where special technical knowledge is used, such as cybersecurity, computer architecture, reverse engineering, digital forensics, system administration. AI has a tremendous potential for the modern criminal process, its use will make it possible to enhance the effectiveness of investigatory work as it will considerably improve the speed and effectiveness of procedural actions and pre-court proceedings for criminal cases in general. It is, however, necessary to take into account the existing risks and limitations connected with its use in court-investigative practice. The authors conclude that in order to ensure the adequate use of opportunities offered by AI in the criminal process, it is necessary to develop ethical and legal principles of its inclusion in the sphere of special knowledge used in criminal court proceedings for acquiring forensic evidence on criminal cases.
Bitcoin, created in 2008, has become the most widely accepted virtual currency in the world. Some believe that Bitcoin will play a significant role in both e-commerce and money transfers, whereas others believe that Bitcoin transactions are more likely to be used by criminals creating fraudulent investments and engaging in drug trafficking and money laundering. This study addresses (1) whether the traditional criminological concepts are applicable in explaining criminal activities in virtual space, (2) what factors contribute to Bitcoin-related offenses, and (3) what lessons could be learned from the current study of Bitcoin-related criminal cases.
When computer systems are increasingly important for our daily activities, cybercrime has created challenges for the criminal justice system. Data can be hidden in ADS (Alternate Data Stream) without hindering performance. This feature has been exploited by malware authors, criminals, terrorists, and intelligence agents to erase, tamper, or conceal secrets. However, ADS problems are much ignored in digital forensics. Rare researches illustrated the contact artifacts of ADS timestamps. This paper performs a sequence of experiments from an inherited variety and provides an in-depth overview of timestamp transfer on data hiding operations. It utilizes files or folders as original media and uses the timestamp rules as an investigative approach for the forensic exchange analysis of file sets. This paper also explores timestamp rules using case examples, which allow practical applications of crime scene reconstruction to real-world contexts. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of temporal attributes, help digital forensic practitioners to uncover hidden relations, and trace the contact artifacts among crime scenes, victims, and suspects/criminals.
Advance fee and non-delivery frauds have become very common with the growing preference for online shopping and the new opportunities this brings for online offenders. This article uses unique access to a volunteer group's database focused on preventing pet scams to explore this type of crime. Distances, among other factors, make the purchase of pets online common in countries such as the USA, Australia and South Africa. This modality of purchase has been exploited by organized criminals largely based in Cameroon to conduct advance fee and non-delivery frauds. The article uses data from the volunteer group Petscams.com to provide unique insights on the techniques of the offenders with particular reference to the strategies used to maximize victimization by using real accounts of victims of such frauds. It also briefly notes how the COVID-19 crisis has been used to adapt this type of scam. The article's discussion identifies the need for a more nuanced assessment into the role of victim oriented voluntary organizations.
The Dark Web serves as a key venue for peddling illegal goods and services, from stolen possessions and drugs to illicit activities. The concurrent increase in Tor network usage and the development of cryptocurrency has led to the creation of major black market sites. One of the most popular illicit services offered on the Dark Web is hacking, which includes website/social media account hacking, Denial-of-service attacks, and custom malware. At the same time, the Dark Web community has formed its own justice system leveraging the layer of anonymity that exists between underground community users and the cybercrime ecosystem. Existing studies predominantly focus on the major drug market operating on the Dark Web, firearm sales, sexual exploitation, and money laundering. To address the gaps in the current research as well as the relative nascency of an underground justice system to monitor hacking services on the Dark Web, this study attempts to broadly capture the dynamic nature of hacking services, which requires continuous research to identify new trends and develop effective responses. The study aims to examine the characteristics and the operations of the hacking service market and the underground justice system on the Dark Web via an in-depth examination of Dark Web forums with a crime script analysis vis-a-vis thematic analysis. The study defines the crime script as that which includes pretrial, mid-trial, finalization, and exit stages. This research sheds light on Dark Web justice courts' procedures and the courts' implications for shaping the future of the Dark Web.
This analysis ruminates on the quintessential qualities that underpin the relationship between computers and crime by drawing from the foundational work of Shoshana Zuboff, a scholar whose work has to date been largely ignored in the study of crime. From this perspective, computers are best described as informating machines that require intellective skills in both licit and illicit forms of work. The first part of this analysis describes the role of such skills in the commission of computer-related crimes and considers factors that affect the degree to which such skills are necessary for perpetration. The second part considers how a Zuboffian approach can inform examinations of other subjects that have historically been considered important for criminological inquiries, including learning and subculture, the emotional experience of crime, and perceptions held by offenders and victims.
"Background: Sex-cybercrimes against children in the Philippines rose by over 400 % during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic exponentially increasing challenges for carers of children, law enforcers, and prosecutors.Objective: Burnout, primary, and secondary traumatic stress are some of the potential mental health risks for child protection carers. How longevity of career is sustained, is unknown.Participants and setting: This idiographic study explored both positive and negative interpretations of frontline workers in the Philippines exposed to sex-cybercrimes against children.Methods: The protocols of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis guided data collection through semi-structured interviews, transcription, and analysis.Results: One superordinate theme: Irreconcilable destruction of innocence, mercy and justice, and the passionate self; highlights the integral struggle that emerged from these participants' roles in child protection. Their faith philosophy of compassion and forgiveness contrasted with the unfathomable corruption and exploitation they witnessed, and their role in removing child victims from perpetrator family members to serve justice. These internal conflicts necessitated a critical need to self-care against psychological vulnerability. Longevity of career emerged from a coexistence of traumatic distress and psychological growth allowing them to redefine their faith and confront the unfathomable with hope, self-valuing, and purpose. Conclusions: Justice and mercy were juxtaposed integral conflicts threatening the psychological wellbeing of these participants. Ineffective organisational support aggravated their traumatic distress as did the lethargy with which world governments' engage in effective controls against online crimes of child sexual exploitation which has meteorically risen as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic."
In the arrest situation of the cybercrime in Japan. over half of crime is related to minors who is using network device. Therefore the actual situation of the applications and the services on the Internet that connect high school student to the cybercrime was investigated. And the environment of the cybercrime by minors was discussed.
"The main purpose of this study is to analyses the targeted cyber-attacks of Pakistani banks that happened or targeted in 2018 and the solution to control the crimes. The aim of the study is to obtain further information on the impact of cybercrime on the Pakistani banking sector. This study examines the important contribution that raising awareness of the security of information about the relationship between cybercrime and organised services can make. The impact of cybercrime on the Organization's activities will be examined by deepening the moderating effects of raising awareness of cyber security. Cybercrime has a undesirable impact on the organization's performance, but knowledge of cyber security weakens the negative impact of cybercrime on the organization's performance. This study focuses on the banking sector and therefore cannot be extended to other sectors. In addition, comprehensive relative studies in other areas with different cultural contexts will contribute to the validation of the research results. Awareness about the security of information weakens the negative effect of cybercrime on performance; therefore, it is important for banks, security, human resource supervisors, training to raise awareness of employees about cybercrime. Cyber-attacks, threats, vulnerabilities, Security attacks and challenges combination of these topics has led to a new study in the field of cybercrime. This study also improves the understanding of the role of employees in combating the effect of cybercrime on organizational performance."
In an exploratory quasi-experimental study, 138 students recruited during a university orientation week were exposed to social engineering directives in the form of fake emails, or phishing, over several months in 2017. The study assessed the risks of cybercrime for students by observing their responses. Three types of scam emails were distributed that varied in the degree of individualisation: generic, tailored, and targeted or 'spear'. The study explored the influence of scam type, cybercrime awareness, gender, IT competence and perceived internet safety on susceptibility to email scams. Although tailored and individually crafted email scams were more likely to induce engagement than generic scams, differences were not significant. Analysis of the variables showed that international students and first year students were deceived by significantly more scams than domestic students and later year students.
Despite recent growths in research exploring the nature and scope of the online illicit marketplace, there has been a dearth of criminological inquiry examining both the chronological and functional steps offenders use to exchange illegal firearms online. As a result, it is unclear what role and function active market participants have within the online illicit firearms market, including the process of advertising, purchasing, and delivering these weapons. The current study sought to address this gap in the literature through a crime script analysis of 19 vendors advertising weapons on the Dark Web. The step-by-step processes involved in the advertising, actualization, and acquisition of illicit firearms were examined in detail.
This research paper focuses on the sensitive issue of, misuse of an individual's photo via internet, where it's been shown that, how an individual's privacy can be on stake and can be a threat to his/her dignity in the society. Cybercrime today tops the chart, where social networking sites often become soft target and a pitcher of source of ideas for committing heinous acts of disgrace and harm to an individual's privacy, so as to lure out some profit, hidden behind such criminal minds. Our paper highlights this sensitive issue and with the example of Facebook (largest social networking site), we will try to share the different scenarios where an individual may face threat to his vulnerability and through our original proposed work, we will show how an anti-copier can prevent the copying of one's personal data by all the possible means from any website available on internet. The beginning of this paper, seeks with the discussion of present scenario of the Facebook where, whatever is presently available, and is in use on this social networking site, is discussed along with focussing on the main issue of copying one's personal photo without his/her consent, from Facebook and sharing it whenever and wherever one wants. Then, some addition of resulting outcomes, because of this photo copying lacuna, are elaborated with descriptive images at every instance where there requirement is demanded. Later on, all the possible ways and methods by which an individual's private data can be used and misused by offenders and criminal minds are highlighted. Further, in the final phase, we have put forward our approach where we have suggested several hypotheses by which the database like images, videos and text can be made more secured such that no intruder can misuse it by any possible means. Our research work, focus on the more security resolving techniques that can be applied over any community site available on internet that provides, a lot of vulnerability for the same concern. By, our proposed work we have shown that, how authenticity can be retained and personal data uploaded on these sites, can be made more confidential and personal.
The current study aimed to examine the harmonization of cybercrime in the Indonesian constitutional law by reviewing its status. The focus of this study was on different aspects of cybercrime in the constitutional law and to find out the extent to which harmonization of cybercrime has taken place. The study adopted sociological research approach along with the application of the theory of law enforcement. The legal aspects of law enforcement policies for cyber security and proving cybercrime were used to conduct the review and analysis. These legal aspects are firmly documented in various Indonesian regulations and laws, such as Indonesian Criminal Code, Act 11 of 2008, Act 19 of 2016, and the Constitutional Law code number 20/PUU-XIV/2016. The 2001 Convention on the cybercrime proposed by European Union had emphasized the harmonization of Indonesian cybercrime regulations with the international regulations and constitutional law. The policies of law enforcement that were to be harmonized and applied for cybercrime minimization involved both penal and non-penal approaches. Some of the policies were strictly specific to the public sector, or the private sector or the military so there is yet a significant requirement of further harmonization of the cybercrime, in the constitutional law while focusing on all of the sectors and bodies equally.
The topic is cybersecurity concerns in international business. The issue of cybersecurity and cybercrime is a complex one with several sources for cybercrime including activities by individual criminals, organized crime, and governments. The research question explored is, Can companies protect themselves given the rise in cybercrime? Research findings conclude that businesses need to increase their efforts and invest in technologies, staff, technical training, and processes and programs aimed at improving the use of risk-based assessments, defenses, intrusion and anomaly detection, and the business's ability to recover should a cybercrime take place.
This chapter explores the laws and unique challenges associated with the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. Crimes that involve the misuse of computers (e.g., hacking, denial of service, and ransomware attacks) and criminal activity that uses computers to commit the act are both covered (e.g., fraud, theft, and money laundering). This chapter also describes the roles of the various federal agencies involved in investigating cybercrime, common cybercrime terms and trends, the statutes frequently used to prosecute cybercrimes, and the challenges and complexity of investigating cybercrime.
The paper shows that the intensification of digitalization processes in public relations generates a whole variety of new risks and threats. The purpose of this work is to systematize the risks and threats of the digital transformation of society for the subsequent development of advanced law-making decisions. To effectively counter digital threats and create effective legal regulation in the use of digital technologies, it is necessary to divide all digitalization threats into 3 groups: hypothetical, justifiable, and epistemological. The justifiable threats include those that appear at the present stage of technical development and urgently require legal solutions. According to the authors, it is on the study of this group of threats that scientists need to focus their attention in order to provide a practice-oriented approach to research. The authors identified three main subgroups of justifiable threats to digitalization: threats to economic security, information leaks, and cybercrime. This work was performed with financial support from the Grant of the President of the Russian Federation No. NSh-2668-2020.6 National-Cultural and Digital Trends in the Socio-Economic, Political and Legal Development of the Russian Federation in the 21st Century.
The current study examines identity fraud victimization within a college student sample. Concepts from the lifestyle-routine activity approach, specifically exposure and proximity to motivated offenders, as well as the personality trait of low self-control, are examined as potential explanations for identity fraud. The knock-on relationship between hacking and identity fraud is also of interest. Using data from a sample of college students at a Midwestern university in the U.S., and structural equation modeling techniques, the findings suggest that peer deviance, low self-control, and hacking victimization are directly related to identity fraud, whereas the relationship between personal deviance and identity fraud victimization operates indirectly through hacking. Overall, the results support lifestyle-routine activities and low self-control as theoretical explanations of identity fraud victimization.
"In this era of technological disruption, as city dwellers change into smart city inhabitants, the perception of information via digital channels is becoming more prevalent and used for decision-making and lifestyle choices. However, the perception of fake news or social media has resulted in poor decision-making and anxiety among smart city residents. Recognizing the importance of filtering false information for the smart city population, this research proposed a policy and platform for filtering false information to be presented to the citizens of Sisaket Smart City, Thailand; this was to ensure the efficient and secure use of large amounts of citizens' information, as well as information exchange between agencies. Additionally, the study was designed to kick-start the use of information in a smart city to make it more efficient and capable of filtering out material that could have harmful consequences or fake news. Recognizing its significance, the researchers proposed building regulations and platforms for detecting and filtering fake news in smart cities using artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The findings indicated that urban inhabitants who moved into Thailand's smart cities, such as Sisaket, were highly receptive to the employment of rules and platforms to filter fake news."
Financial-economic cyber-enabled crime (hereinafter: financial cybercrime) has increased dramatically over the past years. However, research on financial cybercrime is still underdeveloped and highly heterogeneous, especially regarding the processes of initiation to and desistance from crime. This paper synthesizes existing knowledge on pathways into, desistance from, and risk factors related to financial cybercrime, and identifies research gaps. Adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we executed a systematic search and identified 37 eligible documents published as of February 2022, indicating two initiation points into financial cybercrime: involvement in traditional crime, and experiencing strain. Through social learning, individuals then learn the necessary skills and knowledge and engage in financial cybercrime, after which the decision to desist is influenced by a cost-benefit analysis, the use of neutralization techniques, and maturing. As for risk factors, we identified 33, with being male, unemployed, having low self-control and deviant peers, and wanting to earn money quickly being of potential importance. Regarding research gaps, there is a dearth of research related to the initiation and desistance processes of financial cybercrime, and the identified studies lacked a robust research designs, with 76 percent being of low or medium quality. More quality research is needed to address these issues.
"Current literature on online criminal and deviant groups recognises the role of online forums in the transfer of knowledge and socialisation of members, but current research lacks insight on the evolution and convergence of these groups. One area of concerns is how different aspects of these ideologies, most notably misogyny, anti-semitism and racism, are shared and developed between communities making up the manosphere and those dedicated to far-right themes. Current research has found overlaps in memberships across these two online groups, with growing evidence showing members' linkage to online harassment and offline violent incidents (Farrell et al., 2019; Regehr, 2022). To develop appropriate interventions to prevent such violent events, this research attempts to elucidate the different elements of the ideologies expressed in online communities known collectively as the manosphere, by analysing the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre's ExtremeBB dataset. This database includes approximately 46 million posts made by more than 315 thousand registered active members on 12 different online extremist forums promoting misogyny and far-right extremism. To understand the interaction between far-right extremism and misogyny, we perform a qualitative analysis of a selection of posts already categorised by topic. Preliminary analyses show support for the following aspects: (a) similarities in radicalisation mechanisms, and (b) overlaps in the discourse on race and gender. These similarities provide potential gateways for previously isolated members to venture beyond their current association, suggesting the further adoption of extreme ideologies. Such a process, known as radicalisation, is highly correlated with extremism and terrorism (Borum, 2011; McCauley & Moskalenko, 2008). Findings from this research will allow for more precise interventions."
Background: Digital forms of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical marketing (eDTCA) have globalized in an era of free and open information exchange. Yet, the unregulated expansion of eDTCA has resulted in unaddressed global public health threats. Specifically, illicit online pharmacies are engaged in the sale of purportedly safe, legitimate product that may in fact be counterfeit or substandard. These cybercriminal actors exploit available eDTCA mediums over the Internet to market their suspect products globally. Despite these risks, a detailed assessment of the public health, patient safety, and cybersecurity threats and governance mechanisms to address them has not been conducted. Discussion: Illicit online pharmacies represent a significant global public health and patient safety risk. Existing governance mechanisms are insufficient and include lack of adequate adoption in national regulation, ineffective voluntary governance mechanisms, and uneven global law enforcement efforts that have allowed proliferation of these cybercriminals on the web. In order to effectively address this multistakeholder threat, inclusive global governance strategies that engage the information technology, law enforcement and public health sectors should be established. Summary: Effective global eHealth Governance focused on cybercrime is needed in order to effectively combat illicit online pharmacies. This includes building upon existing Internet governance structures and coordinating partnership between the UN Office of Drugs and Crime that leads the global fight against transnational organized crime and the Internet Governance Forum that is shaping the future of Internet governance. Through a UNODC-IGF governance mechanism, investigation, detection and coordination of activities against illicit online pharmacies and their misuse of eDTCA can commence.
"Development of information and communications technologies have greatly affected the way societies, economies and people operate. Worldwide internet usage has increased from 1.7 billion users in 2009 to more than 4.1 billion users in July 2019. The internet and ICT-s have provided opportunities and benefits to governments, businesses and people. On the other hand, it has also made everyone vulnerable to those who wish to attack them. Lone criminals and criminal organisations worldwide have access to powerful capabilities, which they use to identify and target their victims and commit cybercrimes. The reasons for this vulnerability are two-fold: first, governments, societies and businesses are ever more dependent on cyberspace; and second, our understanding of cybercrime remains limited. Cybercrime is a relatively young area of academic research, which has risen both theoretical and practical interest. Yet very few published studies have researched cybercrime as a process, which includes both technical and non-technical aspects. Cyber criminals are increasingly using new technologies, but also developing novel techniques, procedures and business models for their criminal purposes. This paper proposes a process model for financially motivated cybercrime, a practical tool which can be used by various stakeholders in the cybercrime investigation and prevention process; one which is explanatory and has flexibility. The model developed provides a step-by-step account of actions taken by the criminals throughout the crime. It is not intended to be a rigid or linear model but a flexible tool to understand the key steps within a cybercrime process, allowing us to identify major decision points the criminals pass through. By modelling and understanding cyber criminal processes, better oversight on investigations, countermeasures and disruption techniques can be formulated. This has the potential to overcome the challenges in understanding cybercrime across various players involved in the cybercrime investigation process. The aim is to allow those investigating cybercrimes or developing countermeasures to quickly apply new crimes to the model and focus on the specific known (or unknown) decision points in order to conduct their work more effectively."
In light of the differences between traditional forms of victimization and cybercrime victimization, this study examined whether the expansion of self-control theory to the field of victimization could help explain cybercrime victimization as well. This study found that self-control had a weak relationship with multiple forms of cybercrime victimization, but it did not have a direct effect on victimization after controlling for offending measures. Considering that this was incongruent with previous victimization research, these findings raise theoretical and empirical questions for the entire field of victimization regarding the importance of self-control when controlling for relevant peer offending.

Children who use their free time with phones and computers online, interact with the digital environment on a daily basis, where they will often make social contacts with their friends as well as exchange photos and videos with them. However, children often make contact incautiously with new people online and may risk falling victim to sexual harassment or sexual abuse via sexually charged messages, requests to send nude photos or other Child Abuse Materials (CAM). Most of these cases are unreported crimes. Victims do not always understand that they could be victims. Sexual abuse of children endangers children's psychological, physical and social health, and is against the interests of the child and their human rights. The European Commission's Internal Security Fund Police (ISFP) aims to fund projects on fighting cybercrime and child sexual abuse including digital investigations. This paper provides background information for an innovation project intended to get funding from the ISFP. The case study composes up-to-date pictures of sexual abuse of children online in Finland by applying (1) observations of national police officers who have worked with CAM investigations as a tactical, technical or lead investigator to get unwritten knowledge of the challenge of investigations in the future, and (2) earlier research in Finland. Finnish Child Victim Surveys from past years provide a nationally representative sample of the experiences of children between 12 and 15 years of age where online grooming and sexual abuse is reported. In spring 2021, Save the Children Finland published 11-17-year-old children's experiences of and thoughts on online grooming, and its results show grooming to be a common phenomenon and that a portion of children reported contact being made sexual from its very beginning. This case study combines qualitative and quantitative methods for achieving different aspects and paradigms over the CAM investigations in Finland and are now up to date and would describe how crime investigators have to observe CAM crimes in crime investigations and how cases would be investigated effectively and reliably in a timely fashion and without unnecessary mental workload.
Particularly in the last decade, Internet usage has been growing rapidly. However, as the Internet becomes a part of the day to day activities, cybercrime is also on the rise. Cybercrime will cost nearly $6 trillion per annum by 2021 as per the cybersecurity ventures report in 2020. For illegal activities, cybercriminals utilize any network computing devices as a primary means of communication with a victims' devices, so attackers get profit in terms of finance, publicity and others by exploiting the vulnerabilities over the system. Cybercrimes are steadily increasing daily. Evaluating cybercrime attacks and providing protective measures by manual methods using existing technical approaches and also investigations has often failed to control cybercrime attacks. Existing literature in the area of cybercrime offenses suffers from a lack of a computation methods to predict cybercrime, especially on unstructured data. Therefore, this study proposes a flexible computational tool using machine learning techniques to analyze cybercrimes rate at a state wise in a country that helps to classify cybercrimes. Security analytics with the association of data analytic approaches help us for analyzing and classifying offenses from India-based integrated data that may be either structured or unstructured. The main strength of this work is testing analysis reports, which classify the offenses accurately with 99 percent accuracy.
Digital forensic investigation is a complex and time-consuming activity in response to a cybersecurity incident or cybercrime to answer questions related to it. These typically are what happened, when, where, how, and who is responsible. However, answering them is often very laborious and sometimes outright impossible due to a lack of useable data. The forensic-ready software systems are designed to produce valuable on-point data for use in the investigation with potentially high evidence value. Still, the particular ways to develop these systems are currently not explored. This paper proposes consideration of forensic readiness within security risk management to refine specific requirements on forensic-ready software systems. The idea is to re-evaluate the taken security risk decisions with the aim to provide trustable data when the security measures fail. Additionally, it also considers possible disputes, which the digital evidence can solve. Our proposed approach, risk-oriented forensic-ready design, composes of two parts: (1) process guiding the identification of the requirements in the form of potential evidence sources, and (2) supporting BPMN notation capturing the potential evidence sources and their relationship. Together they are aimed to provide a high-level overview of the forensic-ready requirements within the system. Finally, the approach is demonstrated on an automated valet parking scenario, followed by a discussion regarding its impact and usefulness within the forensic readiness effort.
This study looks at the experiences of organizations that have fallen victim to ransomware attacks. Using quantitative and qualitative data of 55 ransomware cases drawn from 50 organizations in the UK and North America, we assessed the severity of the crypto-ransomware attacks experienced and looked at various factors to test if they had an influence on the degree of severity. An organization's size was found to have no effect on the degree of severity of the attack, but the sector was found to be relevant, with private sector organizations feeling the pain much more severely than those in the public sector. Moreover, an organization's security posture influences the degree of severity of a ransomware attack. We did not find that the attack target (i.e. human or machine) or the crypto-ransomware propagation class had any significant bearing on the severity of the outcome, but attacks that were purposefully directed at specific victims wreaked more damage than opportunistic ones.
"eWhoring is the term used by offenders to refer to a type of online fraud in which cybersexual encounters are simulated for financial gain. Perpetrators use social engineering techniques to impersonate young women in online communities, e.g., chat or social networking sites. They engage potential customers in conversation with the aim of selling misleading sexual material - mostly photographs and interactive video shows - illicitly compiled from third-party sites. eWhoring is a popular topic in underground communities, with forums acting as a gateway into offending. Users not only share knowledge and tutorials, but also trade in goods and services, such as packs of images and videos. In this paper, we present a processing pipeline to quantitatively analyse various aspects of eWhoring. Our pipeline integrates multiple tools to crawl, annotate, and classify material in a semi-automatic way. It builds in precautions to safeguard against significant ethical issues, such as avoiding the researchers' exposure to pornographic material, and legal concerns, which were justified as some of the images were classified as child exploitation material. We use it to perform a longitudinal measurement of eWhoring activities in 10 specialised underground forums from 2008 to 2019. Our study focuses on three of the main eWhoring components: (i) the acquisition and provenance of images; (ii) the financial profits and monetisation techniques; and (iii) a social network analysis of the offenders, including their relationships, interests, and pathways before and after engaging in this fraudulent activity. We provide recommendations, including potential intervention approaches."
Source camera identification (SCI) is a forensic problem of mapping an image back to its source, often in relation to cybercrime. In this digital era, this problem needs to be addressed with the utmost care as a falsely identified source might implicate an innocent person. A very practical problem in this study is the presence of unknown models in the set of cameras under question. In other words, the images under question might not have originated from any of the camera models that are accessible to the forensic analyst, but from a different inaccessible source. Under such a circumstance, the conventional source detection techniques fail to identify the correct source, and falsely map the image to one of the accessible camera models. To address this problem, here the authors propose an (N + K) SCI scheme which is capable of identifying N known (accessible) as well as K unknown (inaccessible) camera models. The authors' experimental results prove that the proposed scheme efficiently separates the known and unknown models, and helps to achieve considerably high source identification accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art.
Cybercrimes can cause various kinds of harm to those affected. This paper focuses on how cybercrimes impact undergraduate students, a group particularly vulnerable to cybercrimes due to their extensive use of technology and their recently gained financial responsibility and social independence. We present a mixed methods study to understand students' knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors regarding cybercrimes. 10 semi-structured interviews provided the groundwork for a theoretical model, which was subsequently tested on a sample of 222 survey responses. We found that roughly half of the undergraduate students in our studies have experienced one or more cybercrimes while in college, with malware, hacking, and phishing being the most prominently experienced cybercrimes. Furthermore, we found that students acquire their knowledge of cybercrimes predominantly through people they personally know who have been victimized by a cybercrime and the media. Our model shows how students' knowledge of cybercrimes and their self-control in using the Internet influences their perceived cybercrime self-efficacy and their fear of cybercrimes. Self-efficacy and fear, in turn, influence their tendency to take preventative measures to avoid enabling behaviors and to report cybercrimes to the appropriate entities. We also find that despite the reported importance of adequate cybercrime reporting and access to comprehensive cybercrime statistics, the majority of students do not know how to officially report a cybercrime.
Cybercrime is a kind of criminal activity generally committed by cybercriminals or hackers. Crime activities are growing explosively all over the world which motivates the law enforcement agencies for systematic analysis of crimes. In many cases, crime information is stored as online text reports in an unstructured way and one report describes several different criminal activities. Analysis of these crime reports for identifying patterns and trends in crime and devising solutions to crime detection and prevention strategies are very challenging tasks. In this paper, the crime reports are preprocessed and relations among named entity pairs are extracted to give the structured form to the reports. Each extracted relation is converted to an n-dimensional real-valued vector based on the concept of Word2Vec model of Natural Language Processing. Then a novel agglomerative graph partitioning algorithm using various graph centrality measures is applied to partition the extracted relations. All the extracted relations of a report which are in a single partition are replaced by the representative of that partition and thus each report is described by a set of distinct types of relations. Next, a graph for the set of reports is constructed in such a way that nodes are corresponding to the tuple of relations that describes the reports, and an edge between a pair of nodes is drawn only if the corresponding pair of relations are of a similar type of two different reports. The constructed graph is a disconnected graph with each connected component is a clique. These cliques are easily identified in linear time of the number of edges in the graph and each clique provides a cluster of reports. As each report is described by a set of relations of different types, so obtained clusters are overlapping clusters. The degree of membership of a report in a cluster is also identified in the paper. The proposed method is experimented, and compared with some state-of-the-art partition-based and overlapping clustering algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of crime corpora.

This paper describes an emerging sub-discipline of digital forensics covering financial technologies, or Fintech. The digital transformation of society is introducing new Fintech for payments, funds transfer, and other financial transactions. Criminals are using and abusing financial technologies for fraud, extortion, money laundering, and financing activity in the criminal underground. The investigation of Fintech and digital payment activity needs to be recognized as a new technical sub-discipline of the digital forensics landscape. The digital forensics community is well positioned to provide research for practitioners to enhance investigations involving Fintech and technical financial activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying cybercrime investigation and evidence collection has important practical significance for improving the detection rate of network cases and curbing cybercrime. The article expounds the objectives, basic processes and key technologies of electronic forensics. Through a real case, it analyzes the principles and conditions of remote access to the records in the database, and proposes a method for remotely obtaining data to verify the electronic forensics technology in the case of cyber pornography. The actual forensics process. Finally, the countermeasures and suggestions for the investigation and evidence collection of cybercrime cases are put forward.
As far as malware-related crimes are concerned, extra territorial jurisdiction and the law of extradition need one another to work perfectly, but there has never been a standard universal rule governing them. While Universality Principle can be argued to be the most ideal solution to the problem, it is opposed by the supporters of the notion of self-regulation of the internet, not to mention it lacks the required universal support. Thus the determination of the issues has to be based on the analysis of existing measures of practical applications. (C) 2012 Ftizal Rahman. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
This paper focuses on privacy and security concerns in Big Data. This paper also covers the encryption techniques by taking existing methods such as differential privacy, k-anonymity, T-closeness, and L-diversity. Several privacy-preserving techniques have been created to safeguard privacy at various phases of a large data life cycle. The purpose of this work is to offer a comprehensive analysis of the privacy preservation techniques in Big Data, as well as to explain the problems for existing systems. The advanced repository search option was utilized for the search of the following keywords in the search: Cyber security OR Cybercrime) AND ((privacy prevention) OR (Big Data applications)). During Internet research, many search engines and digital libraries were utilized to obtain information. The obtained findings were carefully gathered out of which 103 papers from 2,099 were found to gain the best information sources to address the provided study subjects. Hence a systemic review of 32 papers from 103 found in major databases (IEEExplore, SAGE, Science Direct, Springer, and MDPIs) were carried out, showing that the majority of them focus on the privacy prediction of Big Data applications with a contents-based approach and the hybrid, which address the major security challenge and violation of Big Data. We end with a few recommendations for improving the efficiency of Big Data projects and provide secure possible techniques and proposed solutions and model that minimizes privacy violations, showing four different types of data protection violations and the involvement of different entities in reducing their impacts.
Cybersecurity has become a significant focal point for law enforcement, businesses, and consumers with the significant advancements made in cyber technologies, cyber use, and cybercrimes, [16]. Organized cybercrime includes activities such as skimming, botnets, provision of child pornography and advance fee fraud. Unorganized cybercrime could be simple fraud, downloading child pornography, trolling or uttering threats. Both organized and unorganized activities have grown more prevalent in today's digital landscape. The media sensationalize breaches, such as the hacking of HBO's Game of Thrones episodes and the Equifax data breach. These incidents get much fanfare shifting focus to law enforcement agencies their plans to address the crimes. We need to know more about the effectiveness of measures against cybercrime and the cooperation between nations against cybercrime. This manuscript examines this issue by exploring how transnational cooperation succeeded in the apprehension of wanted individuals in Operation Avalanche.
In the digital age, cybercrime is spreading its root widely. Internet evolution has turned out to a boon as well as curse for those confronting the issues of privacy, national security, social decency, IP rights, child protection, fighting, detecting, and prosecuting cybercrime. Hence, there arises a need to detect the cybercriminal. Cybercrime identification utilizes dataset that is taken from CBS open dataset. For identifying the cybercriminal, support vector machine (SVM) in the C SVM classification and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models is utilized for determining the cybercrime information. The evaluation of the performance is done taking the following metrics into consideration: true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative, false alarm rate, detection rate, accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, sensitivity, classification rate, and Fowlkes-Mallows Scores. Expectation maximization (EM) calculation is utilized for evaluating the presentation of the Gaussian mixture model. The performance of classifier's presentation is also done. Accuracy is accomplished in the event of grouping by means of SVM classifier as 89% in the supervised method.
Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is perhaps the greatest global health challenge of the last century. Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel infodemic, including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable cures. Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. Objective: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19-related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. Methods: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19-related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. Results: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19-related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. Conclusions: Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the infodemic fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public.
Based on the results of two research projects from the Netherlands, this paper explores how street-oriented persons adapt and use digital technologies by focussing on the changing commission of instrumental, economically motivated, street crime. Our findings show how social media are used by street offenders to facilitate or improve parts of the crime script of already existing criminal activities but also how street offenders are engaging in criminal activities not typically associated with the street, like phishing and fraud. Taken together, this paper documents how technology has permeated street life and contributed to the 'hybridization' of street offending in the Netherlands-i.e. offending that takes place in person and online, often at the same time.
Prior research suggests lifestyle routine activities theory (LRAT) applies to online environments, however, the use of cross-sectional designs may limit the ability to determine whether LRAT behaviors influence online victimization, or if it is victimization that influences the use of LRAT behaviors. The current study used nationally representative panel data from The Netherlands to analyze the relationship between guardianship, exposure, and target attractiveness on hacking and malware victimization, controlling for relevant factors. Using path modeling, two prominent findings emerged. First, of the three LRAT factors, only exposure predicted greater likelihood of cybercrime victimization at a later time. Second, previous cybercrime victimization predicted increases in guardianship and exposure behaviors at a later time. Overall, these findings suggest that cybercrime victimization plays a greater role in changing LRAT behaviors, than LRAT behaviors do in explaining victimization.
This study applies routine activities theory to determine whether the characteristics of jihadi-inspired web defacements in the United States vary from all other defacements performed against IP addresses hosted within the United States from 2012 to 2016. We focus on target suitability variables and use a sample of over 2.2 million defacements reported by the independent website Zone-H. We estimated a binary logistic regression model and found that jihadi cyberattacks were rare among all the defacements performed in this 5-year period. Additionally, these findings demonstrated jihadists were more likely to target organizational websites and utilized specific attack methods compared to all other defacers. We contextualize our findings and outline a number of avenues for future research.
The BitTorrent client application is a popular utility for sharing large files over the Internet. Sometimes, this powerful utility is used to commit cybercrimes, like sharing of illegal material or illegal sharing of legal material. In order to help forensics investigators to fight against these cybercrimes, we carried out an investigation of the artifacts left by the BitTorrent client. We proposed a methodology to locate the artifacts that indicate the BitTorrent client activity performed. Additionally, we designed and implemented a tool that searches for the evidence left by the BitTorrent client application in a local computer running Windows. The tool looks for the four files holding the evidence. The files are as follows: *.torrent, dht.dat, resume.dat, and settings.dat. The tool decodes the files, extracts important information for the forensic investigator and converts it into XML format. The results are combined into a single result file.
Information technology is rapidly increasing and evolving all the time in pursuit for better solutions and products for the digitized world. Technology advancement and greater connectivity has moved organizations to better economic markets for sustainability. Together with better technology and greater connectivity, cybercrime is swiftly growing on par with these developments. This chapter focuses on the cyber security landscape and threats faced by organizations. The growth and sophistication of cybercrime is stressed. Cyber security creative approaches security risk assessment, cloud collaboration and data analytics are provided. This chapter ends with propositions that security creative approaches should be used as a method of managing cybercrime and ensuring that the organization's sustainability and governance are improved.
With increasing development and digitalization in India there is an increase in the cybercrime rate. The problem of phishing of websites, hacking and malware leads to distortion and leakage of important information. There are many incidents which throw light on deteriorating condition of India in terms of cyber world. This paper highlights the spreading, building and working of malware, E-system attacks, website phishing, Cyber bullying etc. The detailed discussion on the various cybercrime incidents has led to a conclusion and generation of technologies such as Honeypots and some preventive measures to avoid cybercrime. Global development and digitalization has led to the services and people to become digitally connected by Internet of things in all sectors of society. Banking is now an online process involving funds transaction and marketing. Business involves cloud computing which is also targeted by various risks such as accountability and data ownership. In the end, the paper concludes about the horrifying condition of India and predicts the future of cyber security in India.
Communication technology and devices are timely changing and increasing various levels and different operating systems in all over the world. As the threats of cyberspace continue to become more hyperconnected it will be imperative that cybercrime has become a reality in the developing countries. Nowadays, our country is just developing country and most of people aren't friendly to use the modern communications system and digital devices. The purpose of this paper is to present the importance for the study of offensive and forensic investigation on cyber space facing against cybercrime using HACKFOSICS forensics tool. There is a need for forensic examiners to investigate the locating and documenting the remnant data on various digital devices to trace the criminal offensive activities. We proposed forensics framework, process flow and (HACKFOSICS) tool for cybercrime forensics investigation.
"Cryptomarkets are increasingly requiring users to purchase products with Monero (a 'privacy coin') to further obfuscate the digital trail of money compared to conventional cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin). This is the first study to explore how cryptomarket communities are used to facilitate norms and behaviours to expedite these emerging cryptocurrency practices. Through a qualitative analysis of Monero threads in a Reddit cryptomarket community (3451 total posts), this research illustrates how online communities often underpin the adoption of new technologies in cryptomarkets. The findings reveal: how the online community functions, adapts, and fails to support cryptocurrency transitions; the appraisal and contestation of cryptocurrency risks; and the ideological drivers and symbolic resources used to align community practices to adopt Monero. This research contributes to an understanding of the processes that underpin the constant evolution of online illicit markets as human and non-human elements are constantly re-assembled."
"The training programs in digital forensics have contributed many case study models to guide digital forensic analyses. However, they only account for a small number of real cases and they are usually too abstract while actual cybercrime investigations are more diverse and complex. This gap leads to difficulties in giving immediate and straightforward actions for law enforcement during cybercrime investigations. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based knowledge map model, which is a foundation model for building a case study management system for Digital Forensic Intelligence (DFINT) and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in digital forensics. The main idea of this proposed model is to encode specific training cases of cybercrime into knowledge map representations, then the system uses the knowledge from the ontology to provide more information on the context and enrich them to match actual cybercrime scenes. Therefore, this approach can be used to bridge the gap between training case studies and the actual investigation environment. To illustrate our approach, we build a DFOSINT ontology for DFINT and OSINT domain; develop a prototype of the case study management system, and evaluate it in two aspects, ontology validation and case study validation with existing case studies of digital investigations."
While cyberattacks are a persistent problem, particularly web defacements, it is unclear what factors differentiate the likelihood of these attacks based on the type of institution that could be targeted. Military and government entities are high-visibility targets for some attackers, though it is unclear whether they are more likely to be defaced on the basis of their operational characteristics or the motives of the attacker. The same is true for educational institutions, which are frequently targeted by ideologically motivated hackers and others seeking to abuse their IT infrastructure. The current study attempted to address this gap in the literature through the application of routine activities theory to identify the factors significantly associated with web defacements against military, government, and educational web domains. Using a sample of 2.2 million web defacements, we examined the perceived value, inertia, visibility, and accessibility of the targets and the attack methods employed in each defacement. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of cyberattacks against high-visibility institutions are discussed in detail.
"Analysing large amounts of data goes to the heart of the challenges confronting intelligence and law enforcement professionals today. Increasingly, this involves Internet data that are 'open source' or 'publicly available'. Projects such as the European FP7 VIRTUOSO are developing platforms for open-source intelligence by law enforcement and public security, which open up opportunities for large-scale, automated data gathering and analysis. However, the mere fact that data are publicly available does not imply an absence of restrictions to researching them. This paper investigates one area of legal constraints, namely criminal-procedure law in relation to open-source data gathering by the police. What is the legal basis for this activity? And under what conditions can domestic and foreign open sources be investigated? These questions are addressed from the perspectives of European and Dutch law. First, the international legal context for gathering data from openly accessible and semi-open sources is analysed, including the issue of cross-border gathering of data. In particular, article 32 of the Cybercrime Convention and some national implementations are discussed, as well as data protection requirements from European Union law. Next, the paper zooms in on the Dutch legal context for open-source investigations, to illustrate how the issues of a legal basis and other legal requirements are addressed in a specific legal framework. The paper draws the conclusion that technology-facilitated investigations of open sources by the police often constitute an interference with the right to privacy; hence, they require a legal, statutory basis that is sufficiently clear for citizens to understand what the police are doing. Moreover, open-source investigation tools and practices used must meet general data-protection requirements and forensic reliability standards. The discussion also shows that interpreting existing legal provisions to accommodate open-source investigation tools can lead to convoluted interpretations, suggesting that legal frameworks of investigation powers with a focus on physical-space investigations may need to be revised to accommodate the particularities of open-source Internet investigations.

"Web defacement is a form of hacking that involves altering the content of a website, resulting in repairs to the website code, loss of revenue, internal loss of productivity, and reputational damage. Limited research has examined the frequency of web defacements, the factors that distinguish them from other hacking motives, and the extent to which the correlates mirror research on physical acts of ideologically-motivated crime. The current study examined over 2.4 million web defacements hosted in the U.S. from 2012 to 2016 to assess aspects of routine activities theory associated with target selection and attack methods among ideologically-motivated defacements. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that ideologically-motivated defacers were more likely to use unknown vulnerabilities; engage in repeated attacks; target top-level domains linked to foreign nations; domains ending in.edu; and homepages within websites. The findings of this study suggest that the target selection process of ideologically-motivated defacers are more purposive and designed to draw attention to their cause, resembling target preferences of individuals who engage in physical violence in support of an ideological agenda."
"The article aims to characterize the forensic features of the initial stage of investigating fraud with financial resources in cyberspace, its significance, analysis, and justification as a type of cybercrime that is dangerous for everyone, and prove the need for urgent measures to prevent and combat such criminal offenses. The authors used several methods of scientific cognition: logical-semantic, system-structural, analytical, formal-legal, forecasting, dialectical, interpretation, and hermeneutics. The article focuses on the general provisions of the forensic characteristics of Internet fraud with financial resources; analysis of the information model of the mechanism of committing fraud with financial resources in the field of computer information; coverage of the tactical features of individual investigative actions at the initial stage of the investigation of fraud with financial resources in cyberspace. It was concluded that the effectiveness of combating Internet fraud and the level of cybersecurity in Ukraine is very low. Therefore, the investigation of fraud with financial resources in cyberspace requires in-depth specific knowledge from the subjects of the investigation."
"The use of information and communication technologies in business has opened several new ways for employees to commit cybercrimes against their employers. Utilizing opportunity theory, the current paper investigates the characteristics of businesses victimized by employee-committed cyberattacks and compares insider- and outsider-committed cybercrime in terms of the damage they cause to the business. We used online sampling to obtain information on 350 businesses in the Commonwealth of Virginia, revealing 29 outsider cases and 17 insider attacks that were clearly identified. We found that insider attacks were more costly, resulting in more damage than external attacks; the most frequent attack type was impersonating the organization online for insiders, and viruses, spyware, and malware for outsiders. Our data suggested restricting personal devices, making cybersecurity a priority, cybersecurity updates among management, and employee training do not significantly lessen the risk or mitigate the effects of insider attacks. We suggest that organizational security culture must be refined and strengthened to identify and prevent insider attacks successfully."
The popularity of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Internet communication technologies being exploited to aid cybercrime is ever increasing. P2P systems can be used or exploited to aid in the execution of a large number of online criminal activities, e.g., copyright infringement, fraud, malware and virus distribution, botnet creation, and control. P2P technology is perhaps most famous for the unauthorised distribution of copyrighted materials since the late 1990's, with the popularity of file-sharing programs such as Napster. In 2004, P2P traffic accounted for 80% of all Internet traffic and in 2005, specifically BitTorrent traffic accounted for over 60% of the world's P2P bandwidth usage. This paper outlines a methodology for investigating a documented P2P network, BitTorrent, using a sample investigation for reference throughout. The sample investigation outlined was conducted on the top 100 most popular BitTorrent swarms over the course of a one week period.
Our lives totally depend on computers and mobile devices. Nowadays, we see a massive development in the digital world that makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family and even work remotely. The growth led to losses and distress caused by cyber-attacks, which attempt to harm by unauthorized access. Cybersecurity is a major issue in our digital world, while cybercrime is increasing. The banking and finance sectors have started to rely on biometric security systems for their apps and services. Biometric identification uses unique human characteristics to authenticate a person's identity, such as voice/speech recognition, fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, iris recognition, signature dynamics, etc. Biometric technology is used in banking, e-commerce, account login, access control, etc, which can be considered a valuable measure against cybercrime. Biometrics is a key to the future of cybersecurity and safeguards against cybercrime.
"Cybercrime has become a major societal concern, and a better understanding OF cybercrime is needed to target and prevent it more effectively, minimize its consequences, and provide support for victims. Research on cybercrime victimization has exploded in the past few years, but much of it relies on convenience samples and is largely descriptive in nature. The research presented here involves the collection of data from a large sample of Virginia households in 2022 (n = 1,206). The data are analyzed to provide a partial test of routine activity theory to better understand fraud and theft via the Internet. The data provide a solid baseline for describing the extent of cyber victimization across the state. Bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regressions) show support for routine activity theory and provide important insights for future research. In particular, we find that certain routine Internet activities may better predict unique forms of cybervictimization than others and that length of time on the Internet is not a good indicator of exposure to motivated offenders. Further, protective guardianship mediates the effects of exposure to motivated offenders; thus, efforts to educate the public on best practices are needed. We conclude that to better assess cybercrime, victimization and engagement, better measurement and longitudinal panel data will be needed."
Forensic skills analysts play an imperative support to practice streaming data generated from the IoT networks. However, these sources pose size limitations that create traffic and increase big data assessment. The obtainable solutions have utilized cybercrime detection techniques based on regular pattern deviation. Here, a generalized model is devised considering the MapReduce as a backbone for detecting the cybercrime. The objective of this model is to present an automatic model, which using the misbehavior in IoT device can be manifested, and as a result the attacks exploiting the susceptibility can be exposed by newly devised automatic model. The simulation of IoT is done such that energy constraints are considered as basic part. The routing is done with fractional gravitational search algorithm to transmit the information amongst the nodes. Apart from this, the MapReduce is adapted for cybercrime detection and is done at base station (BS) considering deep neuro fuzzy network (DNFN) for identifying the malwares.
This article investigates phishing victims, especially the increased or decreased risk of victimization, using data from a cybercrime victim survey in the Netherlands (n = 10,316). Routine activity theory provides the theoretical perspective. According to routine activity theory, several factors influence the risk of victimization. A multivariate analysis was conducted to assess which factors actually lead to increased risk of victimization. The model included background and financial data of victims, their Internet activities, and the degree to which they were digitally accessible'' to an offender. The analysis showed that personal background and financial characteristics play no role in phishing victimization. Among eight Internet activities, only targeted browsing led to increased risk. As for accessibility, using popular operating systems and web browsers does not lead to greater risk, while having up-to-date antivirus software as a technically capable guardian has no effect. The analysis showed no one, clearly defined group has an increased chance of becoming a victim. Target hardening may help, but opportunities for prevention campaigns aimed at a specific target group or dangerous online activities are limited. Therefore, situational crime prevention will have to come from a different angle. Banks could play the role of capable guardian.
Which opportunities due to digitization are exploited by criminals? And how do criminals gather the required ICT-expertise to take advantage of these opportunities? This exploratory study provides insight into criminals seeking ICT-expertise by analyzing five Dutch cases. This paper shows that criminals seeking ICT-expertise take advantage of companies and employees in the ICT-sector that act in a gray area. It is noteworthy that the initial contact of criminals seeking ICT-expertise is often immediately directed to criminal collaboration. In these cases, capacity' is more important than contact'. Furthermore, this paper discusses the role of forums for criminals seeking ICT-expertise. Criminals take advantage of the transfer of knowledge on forums and the existence of crimeware-as-a-service. Finally, this study falsifies the statement that there is a clear division between traditional offender groups taking advantage of the possibilities arising from ICT, and crime groups operating exclusively online. In practice, there are many connections between online and offline activities.
In current digital world, more victims are affected by cybercrime. Cyber world are wide open and it is very easy to target to access data or financial information from any individual, public and private organizations etc., since, internet and web are open, it is very easy to steal data on the unsecured medium of channel. Therefore, protecting financial data required further layers of security counter to the cybercrime. Data protection is one of the most significant methods to preventing data from cyber criminals. In this data protection method, cryptology plays vital role against the cybercriminal on the unsecured communication channel. It provides data privacy, network security, integrity and identity management to access the data authorized personnel's. Many public and private key procedures are recommended for securing data, however there are still a lot of challenge exist in this substance. Most familiar encryption techniques such as RSA, Elliptic curve, DES and AES are functioning against the cybercrime. In this research articles we have discussed about new cryptography technique preventing the cybercrime based on the block cipher scheme. The aim of this research article is to identify the significant method of data protection to prevent the unauthorized persons. Furthermore, the proposed security techniques can implement on SSL, Digital signature, network security etc.,
E-businesses (EBEs) may commit legal offenses due to perpetrating cybercrime while doing the commercial activity. According to the findings, various obstacles might deter cybercrime throughout accounting. The study examined the present laws for accounting policy elements and determined those aspects that should be included in the administrative document for e-business enterprise accounting policies. E-businesses must avoid cyber-crime (CC), which has a detrimental influence on the company's brand and diminishes client loyalty to ensure their success. According to the study's findings, the use of information and control functions of accounting can help prevent cyber-crime in the bookkeeping system by increasing the content of individual internal rules. The authors intended to make online payments for EBE-CC as safe, easy, and fast as possible. However, the internet is known for making its users feel anonymous. E-commerce (EC) transactions are vulnerable to cybercrime, resulting in considerable money and personal information losses.
This study focuses on the organization practices of networks of cybercriminals engaged in serious financial offenses, through a qualitative analysis of the Best and Luckenbill's sociological framework. The study utilized data collected regarding 18 separate criminals investigations from the Netherlands. The results demonstrate that the participants within these networks operated at various stages of deviant sophistication. Surprisingly, the majority of networks exhibit organizational sophistication based on their division of labor and extended duration over time. In fact, most of this sample could be classified as teams or formal organizations. Furthermore, in contrast with prior studies, no loners were present and only a few networks could be classified as colleagues or peers.
Publically accessible, illegal, websites represent an additional challenge for control agencies, but also an opportunity for researchers to monitor, in real time, changes in criminal careers. Using a repeated measures design, we examine evolution in the networks that form around child exploitation (CE) websites, over a period of 60 weeks, and determine which criminal career dimensions predict website failure. Network data were collected using a custom-designed web-crawler. Baseline survival rates were compared to networks surrounding (legal) sexuality and sports websites. Websites containing CE material were no more likely to fail than comparisons. Cox regression analyses suggest that increased volumes of CE code words and images are associated with premature failure. Websites that are more popular have higher odds of survival. We show that traditional criminal career dimensions can be transferred to the context of online CE and constitute some of the key determinants of an interrupted career.
Strong encryption algorithms and reliable anonymity routing have made cybercrime investigation more challenging. Hence, one option for law enforcement agencies (LEAs) is to search through unencrypted content on the Internet or anonymous communication networks (ACNs). The capability of automatically harvesting web content from web servers enables LEAs to collect and preserve data prone to serve as potential leads, clues, or evidence in an investigation. Although scientific studies have explored the field of web crawling soon after the inception of the web, few research studies have thoroughly scrutinised web crawling on the dark web, or ACNs, such as I2P, IPFS, Freenet, and Tor. The current paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that examines the prevalence and characteristics of dark web crawlers. From a selection of 58 peer-reviewed articles mentioning crawling and the dark web, 34 remained after excluding irrelevant articles. The literature review showed that most dark web crawlers were programmed in Python, using either Selenium or Scrapy as the web scraping library. The knowledge gathered from the systematic literature review was used to develop a Tor-based web crawling model into an already existing software toolset customised for ACN-based investigations. Finally, the performance of the model was examined through a set of experiments. The results indicate that the developed crawler was successful in scraping web content from both clear and dark web pages, and scraping dark marketplaces on the Tor network. The scientific contribution of this paper entails novel knowledge concerning ACN-based web crawlers. Furthermore, it presents a model for crawling and scraping clear and dark websites for the purpose of digital investigations. The conclusions include practical implications of dark web content retrieval and archival, such as investigation clues and evidence, and related future research topics.
In recent years cybercrime has increased rapidly in line with the growth of smartphone users. The development of messenger applications has opened up opportunities for cybercrime. Any cybercrime will leave digital evidence that can be tracked and used as digital evidence that applies in court. One of the acts of cybercrime is cyberbullying, in Indonesia, it is ranked 3rd in the world and if it is not followed up, cases of cyberbullying will be rampant. This study carried out the acquisition of digital evidence on the WhatsApp instant messenger application using the Digital Forensics Research Workshop (DFRWS) framework which is a scientific method that has a basis and is proven in court. The Rocchio method is used to investigate cyberbullying cases. Data collection in this study is with dummy data simulated in a cyberbullying scenario on WhatsApp Group Messenger. Research has successfully proven the occurrence of cyberbullying in groups. Obtained the highest R value (0.25) which exceeds the threshold value to say cyberbullying occurs (0.15). Therefore, based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that cyberbullying has occurred in the case scenario studied in this study with 3 bullying perpetrators with different levels, namely Dave, Alex, and Clara, while Jhon is the victim of bullying.
According to a report from McAfee and the center for strategic and international studies, worldwide financial loss due to cybercrime was estimated to be $600 billion in 2017. Researchers are currently exploring new methods for preventing cybercrime in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) show promise as a device that could help in the fight against cybercrime. PUFs are a class of circuit that are unique and unclonable due to inherent variations caused by the device manufacturing process. We can take advantage of these PUF properties by using the outputs of PUFs to generate secret keys or pseudonyms that are similarly unique and unclonable. In recent years, energy harvesting devices, such as piezoelectric devices have been integrated with IoT devices for various purposes such as power generation and sensing applications. In this paper we propose a PUF design based on piezo sensors which are already commonly found in IoT devices. Our proposed PUF is tested in terms of reliability and uniformity.
Online advertising is an effective way for businesses to find new customers and expand their reach to a great variety of audiences. Due to the large number of participants interacting in the process, advertising networks act as brokers between website owners and businesses facilitating the display of advertisements. Unfortunately, this system is abused by cybercriminals to perform illegal activities such as malvertising. In this paper, we perform a measurement of malvertising from the user point of view. Our goal is to collect advertisements from a regular Internet connection and using The Onion Router in an attempt to understand whether using different technologies to access the Web could influence the probability of infection. We compare the data from our experiments to find differences in the malvertising activity observed. We show that the level of maliciousness is similar between the two types of accesses. Nevertheless, there are significant differences related to the malicious landing pages delivered in each type of access. Our results provide the research community with insights into how ad traffic is treated depending on the way users access Web content.
The article deals with the problem of criminal law prerequisites for managing cyberspace. The author notes that the increasing complexity and the increasing use of cybertechnologies and infrastructures are sources of potential risk to cyberstability and cybersecurity. More serious are the threats posed by external events, such as natural disasters or attacks by governments, criminal organizations or individuals. However, the expansion of cyberinfrastructure and cyberservices will provide greater opportunities and benefits, but will also lead to additional vulnerabilities and new challenges that could undermine personal and public security and safety of our societies. The author points out that at present the development of information and communication networks makes it necessary to consider the issues of information security not only at the international level, but also the question of solving the problem of unified management of such networks in the context of international security. At the same time, the achievement of the set goals in this sphere presupposes a political compromise between all the UN member states and the involvement of all interested parties in this process.
OBJECTIVE The current study is to understand the opportunities for and challenges faced by digital healthcare sector. The aim of the study is to suggest measures for securing data and information collected by the sector plus have safer online transactions. DESIGN AND SETTING The secondary data was collected from reliable sources. The primary data was collected online. The quantitative and qualitative analysis was done on data. The data was statistically analysed for this research article. RESULTS Even though healthcare sector has spent on digital health and cybersecurity but still the number of cybercrime cases have increased. An attempt is made to understand the factors that can influence the number of cybercrime cases. CONCLUSION The healthcare sector has opportunities in digital healthcare field in the current pandemic situation. At the same time, it has challenges to reduce the cybercrime cases as hackers are stealing confidential data and to take stringent measures to reduce the same.
Cybercrime is a growing problem, with increasing numbers of people reporting they have been a victim. However, the literature has tended to focus on the characteristics of the perpetrator and has often neglected to examine how the individual differences of victims may have an impact. This paper investigates how the Dark Triad - Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy - may increase the chances of being a victim of online crime. To do this, the Cyber Routine Activities Theory was applied, which suggests victimization is a result of two things: 1) a user's routine online activity which may bring them into contact with nefarious others and/or makes them an attractive target, and 2) the lack of a capable guardian who can defend against such nefarious others. Using an online survey (N = 328), we measured Internet users' Dark Triad traits, along with their engagement in various online activities and the preventative measures used against potential criminals. Findings demonstrated that narcissism and psychopathy increased the likelihood of victimization, but Machiavellianism did not. These relationships were moderated by gender. However, contrary to other work using the Cyber-RAT, preventative measures (e.g. knowledge of computers, presence of anti-virus programs) did not seem to impact on the likelihood of victimization. The challenges of using these findings to reduce cybercrime and future work are then discussed.
Background: The healthcare industry has increasingly been targeted by cybercrime putting patients, organizations, and employees at risk for financial loss and breach of privacy. Malware events compromise system integrity and patient privacy which could lead to delays in treatment, loss of patient data, inability to provide care, and increase in patient harm. In addition, these attacks may also compromise private and personal information for those targeted.Objective: Nurses represent a large portion of frontline healthcare workers and are uniquely positioned to help prevent cyber-attacks. Nursing curriculum should include education about the risks to patient safety from cybercrime and the nurse's role in preventing cybercrime. Nursing education has focused on hygiene for patient safety. Adding cyber hygiene to the essential practices of pre-licensure and advanced practice nurses is a first step to protecting patients, organizations, and employees from the repercussions of a healthcare cyber-attack.
"People frequently encounter sexual stimuli during Internet use. Research has shown that stimuli inducing sexual motivation can lead to greater impulsivity in men, as manifested in greater temporal discounting (i.e., a tendency to prefer smaller, immediate gains to larger, future ones). Extant findings in crime research suggest that delinquents tend to focus on short-term gains while failing to adequately think through the longer-term consequences of delinquent behavior. We experimentally tested the possibility that exposure to sexual stimuli is associated with the tendency to engage in cyber delinquency among men, as a result of their overly discounting remote consequences. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to pictures of sexy women were more likely to discount the future and were more inclined to make cyber-delinquent choices (e.g., cyberbullying, cyber fraud, cyber theft, and illegal downloading), compared with male participants who rated the sex appeal of less sexy opposite-sex pictures. However, these relationships were not observed in female participants exposed to either highly or less sexy pictures of men. In Experiment 2, male participants exposed to sexual primes showed a greater willingness to purchase a wide range of counterfeit rather than authentic products online and experienced a higher likelihood of logging into the other person's Facebook webpage (i.e., invading online privacy). The discounting tendency mediated the link between exposure to sexual primes and the inclination to engage in cyber-delinquent behavior. These findings provide insight into a strategy for reducing men's involvement in cyber delinquency; that is, through less exposure to sexual stimuli and promotion of delayed gratification. The current results suggest that the high availability of sexual stimuli in cyberspace may be more closely associated with men's cyber-delinquent behavior than previously thought."
The rise of the Internet has dramatically increased the degree to which youth may be exposed to online hate content, and simplified the process of sharing this content with others. Viewing messages that contain hate speech or language vilifying others can increase an individual's risk of radicalization to extremist views and the acceptance of violent ideologies. Researchers have begun to explore the risk factors for exposure to such content, with prior studies demonstrating a relationship between low self-control and online activities being important correlates. Few studies have utilized youth samples to assess these relationships, or explored the voluntary consumption and sharing of content. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature using self-report responses provided by a sample of 1,193 youths in South Australia. A series of quantitative models are estimated assessing the relationships between self-control, opportunities to view content using both on and off-line measures, and four dependent variables related to exposure to or sharing of hate content. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of the utility of criminological theory to radicalization and countering violent extremism are discussed in detail.
Malware is a major security threat confronting computer systems and networks and has increased in scale and impact from the early days of ICE Traditional protection mechanisms are largely incapable of dealing with the diversity and volume of malware variants which is evident today. This paper examines the evolution of malware including the nature of its activity and variants, and the implication of this for computer security industry practices. As a first step to address this challenge, I propose a framework to extract features statically and dynamically from malware that reflect the behavior of its code such as the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls. Similarity based mining and machine learning methods have been employed to profile and classify malware behaviors. This method is based on the sequences of API sequence calls and frequency of appearance. Experimental analysis results using large datasets show that the proposed method is effective in identifying known malware variants, and also classifies malware with high accuracy and low false alarm rates. This encouraging result indicates that classification is a viable approach for similarity detection to help detect malware. This work advances the detection of zero-day malware and offers researchers another method for understanding impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
We evaluate the use of data obtained by illicit means against a broad set of ethical and legal issues. Our analysis covers both the direct collection, and secondary uses of, data obtained via illicit means such as exploiting a vulnerability, or unauthorized disclosure. We extract ethical principles from existing advice and guidance and analyse how they have been applied within more than 4 2 recent peer reviewed papers that deal with illicitly obtained datasets. We find that existing advice and guidance does not address all of the problems that researchers have faced and explain how the papers tackle ethical issues inconsistently, and sometimes not at all. Our analysis reveals not only a lack of application of safeguards but also that legitimate ethical justifications for research are being overlooked. In many cases positive benefits, as well as potential harms, remain entirely unidentified. Few papers record explicit Research Ethics Board (REB) approval for the activity that is described and the justifications given for exemption suggest deficiencies in the REB process.
Over the past decade, wireless mobile communication technology based on the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) has been adopted worldwide on a massive scale. However, as the number of wireless users has soared, so has the possibility of cybercrime. WLAN digital forensics is seen as not only a response to cybercrime in wireless networks, but also a means to stem the increase of cybercrime in WLANs. The challenge in WLAN digital forensics is to intercept and preserve all the communications generated by the mobile stations and to conduct a proper digital forensic investigation. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing a wireless digital forensic readiness model designed to monitor, log and preserve wireless network traffic for digital forensic investigations. Thus, the information needed by the digital forensic experts is rendered readily available, should it be necessary to conduct a digital forensic investigation. The availability of this digital information can maximise the chances of using it as digital evidence and it reduces the cost of conducting the entire digital forensic investigation process.
In cybercrime, malware plays a weighty role and malware authors heavily rely on different code obfuscation techniques such as packing, virtualisation, or control flow transformations, and other anti-analysis methods to hide malicious functionality in binary code. With thousands of new malware samples emerging every day, efficient analysis is crucial for fighting malware-based cybercrime. We present a novel meta-framework for malware analysis that helps find the optimal analysis strategy for a malware sample. The research for the work was conducted in a joint project together with the University of Gent in Belgium [L1].
Cybercrime is on the rise. Attacks by hackers, organized crime and nation-state adversaries are an economic threat for companies world-wide. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly become victims of cyberattacks in recent years. SMEs often lack the awareness and resources to deploy extensive information security measures. However, the health of SMEs is critical for society: For example, in Germany, 38.8% of all employees work in SMEs, which contributed 31.9% of the German annual gross domestic product in 2018. Many guidelines and recommendations encourage companies to invest more into their information security measures. However, there is a lack of understanding of the adoption of security measures in SMEs, their risk perception with regards to cybercrime and their experiences with cyberattacks. To address this gap in research, we performed 5,000 computer-assisted telephone-interviews (CATIs) with representatives of SMEs in Germany. We report on their experiences with cybercrime, management of information security and risk perception. We present and discuss empirical results of the adoption of both technical and organizational security measures and risk awareness in SMEs. We find that many technical security measures and basic awareness have been deployed in the majority of companies. We uncover differences in reporting cybercrime incidences for SMEs based on their industry sector, company size and security awareness. We conclude our work with a discussion of recommendations for future research, industry and policy makers.
Research SummaryThe current study examined 1055 stolen data products across 40 vendors on the Open and Dark Web to determine whether different product- and vendor-level behaviors predicted vendors' trustworthiness as reflected in their product price point. Understanding the mechanisms that convey trust in the underground marketplace is crucial as it could help law enforcement target serious actors and disrupt the larger marketplace. Findings suggest the online stolen data market may resemble an uninformative cost condition where buyers are unable to accurately differentiate credible sellers due to the obscure nature of signaling behaviors.Policy ImplicationsLaw enforcement would benefit from designing fake shops and deceptive forum posts that transmit mixed signals to complicate market participants' process of interpreting trust signals as intended. These interventions would generate high levels of risk that encourage both buyers and sellers to exit the online illicit marketplace without needing law enforcement arrests. Law enforcement could also target prominent market facilitators to generate a larger disruption that prevents actors from continuing their illicit behavior.
This research employed post-conviction polygraph testing on first offence internet child abuse image downloaders. The study systematically addressed the different child sexual behaviours exhibited by 38 men who were convicted of possessing child pornographic materials. The results indicate that additional risk-profile data are essential for the reduction of future victimization.
The increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will make them targets for attacks. IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose Probe-IoT - a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. Probe-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and stores them securely as transactions in public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Probe-IoT presents a scheme that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public ledger. Furthermore, during the investigation of a malicious incident, Probe-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and verify the authenticity and integrity of the obtained evidence.
Do online conflict management styles affect the likelihood of cybervictimization? To answer this question, we use an online survey of youth and young adults recruited from a demographically balanced sample of Americans. Using an extended version of routine activity theory, we examine how two conflict resolution styles-self-help and toleration-affect the target suitability of online users and, in turn, their likelihood of being the victim of cybercrime. Our findings demonstrate that individuals who adopt the confrontational conflict resolution style of self-help upon witnessing hostile behavior online are at an increased risk of being victimized. However, tolerating online conflict does not significantly influence the likelihood of victimization, net of other online behaviors and sociodemographic characteristics.
As our society becomes increasingly interconnected and reliant on technologies, the need for digital forensics is no longer restricted to cybercriminal investigations. For example, when a private organization's system is compromised due to unauthorized access or espionage, digital forensic investigations can help to reveal the 'what, why, how, who, when, and where' relating to the incident, and the findings can inform decision-making and mitigation strategy formulation. Taking an interdisciplinary lens, this paper uses the design science approach to guide the development of an integrated digital forensic framework. It is then demonstrated how the framework can be used by a forensic investigator to examine Android applications, using a series of case studies (also referred to as instantiations of the method artifact in the design science literature).

The advancement of the Internet has great potential for the well-being of citizens and business growth, but this new paradigm also entails cybersecurity challenges that can have high economic impacts. The growth of Internet use is also leading to a general increase in cybercrime concerns as well as the number of users' victims of this permanent threat. This reality is also very present in Portugal as well as in other European countries. In this context, it is important to know some indicators associated with cybersecurity, to take the best measures/actions in a reasoned way, and to combat this phenomenon. This article presents the results of a study carried out in 2019 by the European Commission, whose analysis helps to understand the Portuguese positioning in the concerns and attitudes about cybercrime, to the average of the European Community citizens. Analysing this study, it was possible to perceive that the Portuguese's concerns about cybercrime are in line with the average of the European citizens, although the percentage of Portuguese that takes attitudes and actions to combat cyber-threats is a little bit above the average recorded by citizens of European countries.
This chapter explores the online pharmaceutical trade setting the background for the rest of the book and presents the research questions that drove the study. The chapter starts by considering how medicines came to be available to purchase online and why this is seen as problematic via the associated risks. A critical discussion is then presented, unpacking these risks and how the discourses surrounding them are intertwined with authoritative challenges. The chapter concludes with an empirical examination of the online pharmaceutical trade.
This paper focuses on the European Union's collective efforts to address cybercrime and argues that the European Union (consisting of 28 Member States) has more than a single overarching 'strategic cyber culture'. This is due to the differences in attitudes and experiences of cyber security among Member States that has created fragmentation in the EU's cyber security institutional system. This paper therefore considers the institutional developments by examining the main 'carriers' of EU strategic cyber culture such as the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG HOME), Eurojust, and Europol/EC3, together with the strengths and weaknesses of the EU's particular approach to cybercrime.
With the plethora of information exchange in online communication, occurrences of some unwanted vices like cybercrimes and cyber bullying have taken shape. It is imperative to develop a prediction model for cyber-crime prediction. The existing technical approaches to identify these unwarranted activities have not achieved the required success rate. In the proposed approach, methods of Machine Learning and Neural Network are used for analyzing and predicting the occurrence of cybercrime. We have considered four major categories of cybercrime, namely cyber bullying, cyber harassment, cyber fraud and cyber hacking for performing various experiments. In the proposed model we have achieved an accuracy of 97.6% while predicting cyber-criminal activities.
The author provides one of the first empirical examinations of cyberstalking perpetration. The extent and nature of cyberstalking are investigated using a sample of college students from a large university in the Midwest. The results indicate that cyberstalking was perpetrated by 4.9% of research participants. In addition, the findings suggest that persons with low self-control are significantly more likely than their peers to perpetrate cyberstalking. Those who participated in sexting were also more likely to engage in cyberstalking. However, these variable effects differed by sex. In particular, women with low self-control were at higher risk of perpetrating cyberstalking, while low self-control did not affect offending risk for men. These results speak to the potentially gendered nature of cyberstalking, while at the same time finding that the prevalence of offending was essentially the same for men and women.
Large scale, subscription based, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) media piracy is occurring despite current copyright enforcement efforts. Cybercriminals are abusing legitimate services to setup and maintain illegitimate business operations offering pirated media content on a subscription basis. Due to the underground aspect of these pirated IPTV operations, these services are not well understood and so current enforcement action against them appear to not be effective. In this paper, we empirically measure the network infrastructure, payment, and order intermediary services that are used by a subset of the infringing IPTV ecosystem. We demonstrate how the measurements we make in this paper give insight into the business behind subscription based pirated media. Lastly, we show how these measurements can lead to potentially more informed policy decisions and intervention measures against subscription based IPTV piracy.
The threat from cybercrime is increasing, targeting citizens, businesses and governments at a rapidly growing rate (Europol, 2015). The information and communication technologies (ICT) rapid development brings for society not only many benefits, but many threats too. ICT nature, especially the speed, convenience and anonymity of the Internet commit a diverse range criminal activities and new trends in cybercrime that threaten business processes, eroding the employees integrity, and damages the organizations reputation. The paper deals with two problems in cyber society. Initially gather facts about non-ethical exploiting information and computers in society. On the other hand deals with motives that lead to unethical activities. Final thesis section is looking at potential solutions to ethical problems in cyber society.
Passwords are but one link in the cybercrime value chain. Contrary to popular belief, compromised users are made whole and thieves have a hard time monetizing stolen credentials.
"The present exploratory study sought to address a gap in the current literature on problematic Internet use by investigating the relationship between Internet addiction and digital piracy. The main research question guiding this study was whether IA was correlated with digital piracy. The expectation was that IA would indeed be correlated with digital piracy and increase odds of perpetration. Secondly, taking into account that previous literature on both IA and digital piracy emphasizes the importance of online relationships (Acier & Kern, 2011; Fitzpatrick, 2008; Marcum, Higgins, Wolfe, & Ricketts, 2011), it was expected that deviant peer association would increase the odds of pirating. Finally, taking into account that previous research on both IA and digital piracy has largely shown that these problems affect a greater proportion of males (Andreou & Svoli, 2013; Gunter, Higgins, & Gealt, 2010; Hinduja, 2012; Lam, Peng, Mai, & Jing, 2009; Shaw & Black, 2008), it was expected that being male would increase the odds of pirating.

Zeus is a well-known and effective family of 'man-in-the-browser' malware. This qualitative case study analyses posts in online cybercrime forums that discuss Zeus configuration. Online cybercriminals were found to share, sell, steal, and trade configuration files. The discussions and advertisements on the forums, which span four years, were found to evolve with market conditions and externalities, including Zeus being offered as a subscription service. The release of tools to decrypt configuration files by security researchers was also closely followed on the forums, and assisted offenders when it came to stealing configuration files from others.
Despite the rapid escalation of cybercrimes in modern society, few viable cybersecurity and cybercrime prevention programs exist. Consequently, this research considers cybersecurity as a key element for mitigating the potential risk and incidents of cybercrime. The study aims to understand the role of individuals' cybersecurity knowledge and awareness in shaping their cybersecurity intention and behavior in the United States. The results reveal that information and communications technology variables, education, income, and gender are contributing predictors of a level of cybersecurity knowledge. The effects of information and communications technology variables varied across gender for both correct and uncertain responses. The findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive understanding of both technical and human/individual factors for cybersecurity knowledge and education.
Phishing is a cybercrime which is carried out by imitating a legal website to trick users to steal their personal data, including usernames, passwords, account numbers, national insurance numbers, etc. Phishing frauds may be the most widespread cybercrime used today. Machine learning focuses on computer algorithms which improves automatically through experience. Machine learning methods were utilized to detect phishing URLs that typically evaluates an URL based on a feature or set of features extracted from it. This paper presents an approach to identify phishing websites using trained machine learning models. It also delivers a detailed analysis of phishing attacks with a comparison on machine learning approaches used for analysis and classification of phishing and legitimate websites.
Large-scale dark web marketplaces have been around for more than a decade. So far, academic research has mainly focused on drug and hacking-related offers. However, data markets remain understudied, especially given their volatile nature and distinct characteristics based on shifting iterations. In this paper, we perform a large-scale study on dark web data markets. We first characterize data markets by using an innovative theoretical legal taxonomy based on the Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention and its implementation in Dutch law. The recent Covid-19 pandemic showed that cybercrime has become more prevalent with the increase of digitalization in society. In this context, important questions arise regarding how cybercrime harms are determined, measured, and prioritized. We propose a determination of harm based on criminal law qualifications and sanctions. We also address the empirical question of what the economic activity on data markets looks like nowadays by performing a comprehensive measurement of digital goods based on an original dataset scraped from twelve marketplaces consisting of approximately 28,000 offers from 642 vendors. The resulting analysis combines insights from the theoretical legal framework and the results of the measurement study. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine these two elements systematically.
Cyber attacks are increasingly menacing businesses. Based on the literature review and publicly available reports, this article conducts an extensive and consistent survey of the services used by the cybercrime business, organized using the value chain perspective, to understand cyber attack in a systematic way. Understanding the specialization, commercialization, and cooperation for cyber attacks helps us to identify 24 key value-added activities and their relations. These can be offered as a service for use in a cyber attack. This framework helps to understand the cybercriminal service ecosystem and hacking innovations. Finally, a few examples are provided showing how this framework can help to build a more cyber immune system, like targeting cybercrime control-points and assigning defense responsibilities to encourage collaboration.
This study analyzes different attitudes toward introduction of smart policing technologies in cybercrime policing among the Korean public and police. Policing is essential for a sustainable community. Technological advances in policing have both positive and negative aspects, making it essential to investigate perceptions of both public and police when introducing smart policing technologies. A discrete choice experiment was undertaken to survey preferences of the public and police toward introduction of such technologies and conduct simulation analysis to compare changes in the acceptance of various scenarios. The study divides cybercrime policing into prevention and investigation. The sample included 500 members of the public and 161 police officers. The results show that the public thinks an increase in yearly taxes and invasion of privacy are the most important factors. Conversely, the police think factors enhancing the efficiency of policing are most important. Moreover, when smart policing technologies are introduced, the public and police perceive more utility in the prevention and investigation of cybercrime, respectively. Few studies in this field separate the prevention and investigation of crimes, or compare perceptions of the public and police toward the introduction of smart policing technologies. This study's quantitative analysis provides insights lacking in previous literature.
Personal data is the primary target of cybercrime. Robot network or abbreviated as botnet is a program that infects the computers and allows the botnet owner to control the infected computers. The botnet can be controlled to steal personal data of the infected computers, as well as using the computer to other cybercrime purposes. This research aims to identify the botnet in the flow traffic by using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The flow traffic data source is obtained from CTU-13 datasets, which contain the real flow traffic captured by Czech Technical University. As a result, the botnet identification accuracy lies in the range of 75.84% to 97.27%, depends on the scenario and the k value. Although KNN has shown a good accuracy result, several other methods outperform KNN accuracy.
This article provides an exploratory overview of crowdsourced surveillance of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage over the Internet. Although the use of CCTV in both public and private surveillance is well documented, footage is now distributed over the Internet for large crowds to monitor. This article briefly introduces the concept of crowdsourcing and explains its shift from a quasi-communitarian mode of production to a business model and crime-fighting strategy. This is followed by a review of relevant scholarly literature that provides a theoretical basis for understanding crowdsourcing as it applies to CCTV surveillance online. This article then considers four case studies of crowdsourced CCTV surveillance on the Internet. These four UK-based examples provide an overview of an emerging phenomenon of how crowds can be integrated into CCTV surveillance, ranging from identifying suspects to designating suspicious behaviour in everyday activity. This article concludes by considering the broader social risks, extending from literature on CCTV, surveillance and crowdsourced labour.
The paper seeks to address the lapses in policy formulation and implementations on the issue of database in Nigeria and by extension the rest of developing countries that are confronting with various activities of cyber criminals. Most of these government pay leap service to boosting the image of their countries whereas it is in their sole responsibility to monitor communications and detect abuse on networks due to influence of globalization. Up till now, no dependable data base of citizenry in Nigeria and that makes it difficult to check people activities online which resulting to all security issues that presently deforming the country images. Images are measured by performance of invisible indicators. The study seeks on how Nigeria can improve her image by identifying the impact of information security and effective governance with the immediate application of automation system in the country since country's reputation plays a major role in attracting investment and boosting the economy, as reputation negatively affected by the increasing number of cybercrime incidents. Data security and cybercrime in Nigeria are significant and need to be addressed as a matter of urgency by taking proactive steps to improve data security, enhance cybercrime enforcement, and protect the country's image, Nigeria can build a more secure and stable digital environment for its citizens.
Cybervictimization is a significant challenge and increasing concern. This study explored the predictors of an aggregate measure of six different types of cybervictimization, incorporating property (online consumer fraud, online identity theft), interpersonal (cyberbullying and cyberstalking), as well as phishing and malware infection crimes. An online survey was self-administered to 726 individuals, measuring sociodemographic variables and routine activity variables, stemming from Routine Activities Theory (RAT). Of the 726 individuals, 440 were already victims of at least one cybercrime. Communicating or giving personal information to unknown individuals doubled the likelihood of being victimized online. Education increased the likelihood of victimization, while higher income was associated with a lower likelihood of online victimization. These results are discussed in relation to the RAT framework and existing empirical studies that have applied it to explain online victimization.
Within the past decade, Africa has witnessed a phenomenal growth in Internet penetration and the use of Information Communications Technologies (ICTs). However, the spread of ICTs and Internet penetration has also raised concerns about cyber security at regional and sub-regional governance forums. This has led African intergovernmental organizations to develop legal frameworks for cyber security. At the sub-regional level, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has adopted a Directive on Cybercrime, while the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have adopted model laws. At the regional level, the African Union (AU) has adopted a Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. This paper seeks to examine these legal instruments with a view to determining whether they provide adequate frameworks for mutual assistance and international cooperation on cyber security and cyber crime control. The paper will argue that the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection does not provide an adequate framework for mutual assistance and international cooperation amongst African States and that this state of affairs may limit and fragment international cooperation and mutual assistance along sub-regional lines or bilateral arrangements. It will recommend the development of international cooperation and mutual assistance mechanisms within the framework of the AU and also make a case for the establishment of a regional Computer Emergency Response Team to enhance cooperation as well as the coordination of responses to cyber security incidents.
Often, women are vulnerable in their daily lives, so many activists nowadays are trying to influence the society in order to understand how to deal with different situations and how to deal with women in those situations. However, it should not be forgotten that additional threats and problems appeared with the advent of technology. It's hard to trace criminals and perpetrators in cyberspace, because there is no border here, and it takes just a few clicks to reach the victim. On a daily basis using the Internet, various websites and social networks are faced with various threats, such as cyberbullying, sexting, bossing, etc. Especially vulnerable are women here. Often women are shy to reveal to others that there is something bad or has already occurred, they do not want to be publicly embarrassed, so still a very large number of women who are subject to attacks in cyberspace are unidentified. The author wants to see various cyber threats and crimes happening in the Internet environment both in the world and in Europe. Preventive measures that will allow women and Internet users to feel safe in this environment will also be addressed. The article is to present the main threats to the Internet among women and to offer opportunities for how to be safe. The main tasks are to identify among all threats in cyberspace direct threats against women, to find the opportunity to protect women and raise their awareness of issues. The paper mainly uses empirical methods, as well as analysis of literature and scientific research, legal aspects of different countries. The results can be used both theoretically and practically. They will help women around the world become aware of the dangers of cyberspace and protect themselves.
Malware-campaign investigation has a significant impact on deterring cybercrime. Semantic technologies could provide a better balance between human reasoning skills and computer processing capabilities, thus enhancing investigations of the malware ecosystem.
The increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will make them targets for attacks. IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose FIF-IoT-a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. FIF-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and store them securely as transactions in a public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Hence, FIF-IoT eliminates a single entity's control over the evidence storage, avoids single-point-of-failure on the storage media, and ensures high availability of evidence. FIF-IoT presents a framework that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public digital ledger. Furthermore, FIF-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and to verify the integrity of the obtained evidence. We present a case study of a forensic investigation to demonstrate that FIF-IoT is secure against evidence tampering. We also implement a prototype to evaluate the performance of FIF-IoT.
Phishing is a cybercrime in active growth that victimizes a large number of individuals and organizations.To explore which individual and contextual factors predict phishing susceptibility, an online survey was developed, and participants were invited to participate through institutional email from the University of Porto and social networks. The total sample was constituted of 449 individuals.Results showed that subjects that perceive to have phishing detection self-efficacy and those that have greater use of services in Internet routine activities were more susceptible to phishing. Technology competencies and other individual variables do not predict phishing susceptibility in our sample.Furthermore, the majority of factors (individual and contextual) tested do not predict phishing susceptibility. So, more studies are needed to understand which factors influence this susceptibility, and regarding that how individuals can protect themselves.Finally, potential applications of this research include replication in other countries/contexts, and/or the application of the survey together with other innovative tools.
The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) provides yet another pervasive platform, leading to more potential cybercrimes. There is a need to determine the required procedures and actions by software development companies, service providers, government agencies and users before the phenomenon invades the world. To that end, using a mixed-method approach, our work aims to tackle the IoT potential threats in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, especially from the government sector, where it is important to elaborate the government roles from different perspectives to minimize the cybercrime threats to the IoT. The roles of the legislations, national data centers, national information centers, different ministries, and government departments are important to help to minimize the cybercrime risks in the up and coming IoT space that is still lacking in the KSA.
The purpose of this study is to understand public awareness of cybersecurity-related issues and discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees and confidential organizational data are vulnerable to cyber-attacks as a result of the pandemic, which has raised concerns about cyber security about the new normal of working from home. The public's main sentiments and aspects related to cyber security concerns have been mined from tweets on the microblogging social media website Twitter. Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling techniques have been applied to understand the perspectives, emotions, and themes discussed by people. The analysis reveals people are becoming more aware of cybercrime-related concerns and are more positive than negative in combating the challenge of cybercrime. The paper also highlights the main themes revealed by Topic Modeling.
Much has been written about the legal rights and interests of government, private industry and individual users in the cyberspace. However, relatively little has been written about how codes of conduct, public private partnerships, standards and collaborative efforts can be used to structure advancement in technological knowledge for the benefits of all users and how these efforts can better prioritize the rights and responsibilities of each of the actors in cyberspace. This paper presents a conceptual framework for building sustainable partnerships between government and private industry and looks to models of successful partnerships both nationally and internationally. The paper provides an overview of the various collaborations and conflicts in these partnerships, and the governance and organizational issues involved in protecting American cybersecurity. Based on empirical research and an analysis of national and international cybersecurity partnership initiatives, legislation and policies, this paper explores the issues impacting a cohesive, integrated, unified strategy between the government and the private sector including the issues of governance, incentives, risk sharing and the transnational nature of cyberspace. Recent government frameworks are analyzed including the proposed Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), the President's Executive Order (EO) 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework launched in February 2014. In the course of the research, the author has interviewed various government and private sector experts on national intelligence and cybersecurity and has analyzed relevant documents, data, case studies and government and private industry reports concerning the present and future challenges they face in developing viable public private partnerships. The research thus far has resulted in a better understanding of the major issues in cybersecurity and national intelligence and the importance of partnerships and information sharing as a critical component of advancing the goals of both domains in advancing world peace and private sector interests.
Exchanges serve an essential role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is through exchanges that most people acquire Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, often avoiding the blockchain entirely. Because so many customers put their trust and financial resources in exchanges, it is no surprise that they have long been targets of cybercriminal actors. This paper examines 822 cryptocurrency exchanges operational from 2010-2022. We find that 40% of these exchanges subsequently shut down. Using regression and survival analysis, we investigate the factors that could precipitate the closure of exchanges. Consistent with prior work, we find some evidence that experiencing security breaches are associated with closure. However, we find that the strongest effects are connected to how the exchange operates. Exchanges that only trade cryptocurrencies and not fiat face approximately 60% greater odds of shutting down than those that trade both. Trading more coins is negatively associated with failure. Meanwhile, exchanges that permit US customers shut down more quickly, which suggests that the regulatory environment may affect exchange lifetimes.
Cybercrime is one of the most serious threats. Efforts are made to reduce the number of cybercrime is to find new techniques in securing data such as Cryptography, Steganography and Watermarking combination. Cryptography and Steganography is a growing data security science. A combination of Cryptography and Steganography is one effort to improve data integrity. New techniques are used by combining several algorithms, one of which is the incorporation of hill cipher method and Morse code. Morse code is one of the communication codes used in the Scouting field. This code consists of dots and lines. This is a new modern and classic concept to maintain data integrity. The result of the combination of these three methods is expected to generate new algorithms to improve the security of the data, especially images.
Academic, legal and practitioner responses to cyber threats have been predominantly reactive, punitive, and deterrence-based, with limited attention given to the motives underlying computer criminals' behaviors. This paper reasons that new and better theoretical perspectives are needed to explain computer criminals' motives. Following a review of the computer crime behavioral literature, a summary review of core philosophies and theories used to explain generalized crime and criminal motives is provided. A framework is proposed suggesting that criminological theories have evolved along two categorical dimensions: determinism-indeterminism, and individualism-collectivism. The paper then reasons that future computer crime research will benefit by considering indeterminist-collectivist (constructivist) theories. Two such theories, social construction of technology, and actor-network theory, are proposed in the discussion section, along with some cybercrime examples. The paper invites a deeper consideration of the origins and motivations of computer-based criminality as a means of building stronger theory and ultimately advancing more proactive and effective solutions.
Offline, crime and resulting victimization is not individual incidence. It is also hampered or encouraged by the community in which it is situated. Are community characteristics relevant for victimization online? This paper examines the prevalence of Craigslist-based (automobile) scams across 30 American cities. Our methodology analyses historical scam data and its relationship with economic, structural, and cultural characteristics of the communities that are exposed to fraudulent advertising. We find that Craigslist scams are not random, but targeted towards specific communities. The resulting policy insight is for creating public awareness campaigns addressing educated white males, as they are the most vulnerable.
Fraud in the field of digital technologies is becoming more sophisticated and widespread. Monitoring of fraudulent schemes for cybercrime allowed identifying criminal acts based on these types of fraud and preventing them at an early stage.
With the advancement of new technologies, modern society is surrounded by devices and services with internet connectivity. It provides us the better lifestyle, convenience of services and easy communications. But it opens many security flaws if we can't take proper security measures. Cybercrime might occur from any place at any time and the consequences are endless. Cybercrime is not limited to any specific area. It can be in any sectors like the financial institute, government institute, educational institute, health sectors and so on. We need a solution to protect us from any cyber crimes. Without knowing the possible cyber threats and challenges, it is very difficult to deal with cyber attacks. In this paper, the summary of major cybersecurity threats and challenges in modern society are presented and the solutions are proposed to protect from cyber threats.
Criminologists and crime prevention practitioners recognize the importance of geographical places to crime activities and the role that place managers might play in effectively preventing crime. Indeed, over the past several decades, a large body of work has highlighted the tendency for crime to concentrate across an assortment of geographic areas, where place management tends to be absent or weak. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of research evaluating place management strategies and cybercrime within the virtual domain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of place management techniques on reducing cybercrime incidents in an online setting. Using data derived from the information technology division of a large urban research university in the United States, this study evaluated the impact of an anti-phishing training program delivered to employees that sought to increase awareness and understanding of methods to better protect their virtual places from cybercrimes. Findings are discussed within the context of the broader crime and place literature.
The research aims to analyze the issue of information security in Brazil, understood as necessary for the defense of private data in the face of the advance of virtual crime from the advent of the internet. It is also intended to understand the advances made by the Brazilian legal system, in addition to the executive and business efforts, in order to promote greater legal certainty in the scope of data and information. Using the bibliographic method, through scientific and documentary literature, it is observed that the construction of a new fully virtual environment gave rise to the so-called information society, which globally interconnects subjects through cyberculture and cyberspace, without physical limitations, factors responsible for the structuring of circumstances hitherto unexperienced by humanity and, consequently, by the Law. The emergence of new facts and personal and institutional values related to information in contemporary society, has demanded from the Law the adequacy and/or reconstruction of legal categories, based on the constitutional equation, which is clear and applicable to any type of information: the holder of information owes the utmost respect to the privacy of individuals and the maximum transparency of acts involving public interests. However, in relation to legislative production, an extension and deformalization of procedures is pointed out, the greater the complexity and risk presented by the matters to be standardized.
Evolution of the WEB and high anonymity of virtual identities result in positive and negative impact on society. One of the negative effects is a problem of false spam opinions, which are distributed throughout WEB forums and recommendation portals. Researches in this area mainly concern detection of particular examples of spam opinions. Nevertheless, an idea of detecting virtual multi-identities, created by a single person, still seems to be lacking effective solutions. Presented article describes a system which allows to search virtual multi-identities, created in order to generate spam opinions. The system bases on a combination of features from various domains: natural language processing, time-activity analysis and related to common objects. Series of tests evaluated system's efficiency in the area of detecting virtual multi-identities from recommendation portal.
This is a short paper on the historical growth and spread of spam and Internet abuse, including telemarketing and mobile messaging spam, in India. Additionally, it covers current and proposed Indian law, and regulatory / law enforcement actions against cybercrime.
Mobile banking has become the most preferred banking method globally due to the prevalence and popularity of mobile technology. The widespread adoption and usage of mobile devices for banking has attracted a lot of cybercrime. Despite the national government gazetting NCPF to standardise cybersecurity efforts in South Africa, it is not adequately regulated as cybercrime continues to rise. This paper surveyed the literature to develop a cybersecurity culture framework to mitigate cybersecurity challenges in the South African mobile banking sector. The socio-technical systems theory was adopted as the underlying research theory of this paper. A literature survey was conducted, and the outcomes were thematically interpreted. Findings revealed that critical components of a successful cybersecurity culture framework should incorporate support, cybersecurity collaboration, policy, and monitoring and evaluation. The proposed framework may help to secure mobile banking communities from ever-evolving cyberattacks.
The distribution of malicious spam occurs in substantial numbers around the globe and can function as a precursor to serious forms of cybercrime. Yet to date, no known study has employed criminological theory to gain insight into the macro-correlates of malicious spam victimization. To address this gap in the literature, the current study utilizes data gathered from multiple sources to assess whether variables derived from routine activity theory are associated with malicious spam victimization at the country-level. Findings indicate that multiple measures of target suitability increase the amount of malicious spam a country receives. Specifically, corruption, political freedom, gross domestic product, and being an Asian nation are associated with an increase in malicious spam victimization. Capable guardianship, however, does not decrease the amount of malicious spam a country receives, and in some instances, is associated with an increase. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.
National cybersecurity capacity building involves the development of managerial, technical, social, legal, policy, and regulatory initiatives by a growing ecology of actors to enhance the resilience of nations to cybersecurity breaches, cybercrime, and terrorism. Capacity building is therefore resource intensive, requiring attention across sectors of society, ranging from governments to Internet users. However, it is difficult to justify commitments to capacity building when the benefits of building national cybersecurity capacity are largely based on logical reasoning, limited case studies, anecdotal evidence, and expert opinion rather than systematic empirical evidence. To explore the value of capacity building, this article reports on the early phase of a systematic effort to bring together cross-national data from multiple sources to examine whether indicators related to the cybersecurity capacity of a nation help explain the experiences of Internet users-one of the final payoffs of cybersecurity capacity building.
This paper analyses the relationship between the drop in traditional crimes in Western highly industrialized societies and the evolution of cybercrime. It includes a review of the criminological debate on the crime drop, which shows that the exchanges between researchers allowed clarifying its extent and limits, but without reaching agreement about its causes and seldom taking into account the trends in cyber-related offences. The paper also reviews the data available on the latter and arrives to the conclusion that European police statistics rarely include them and, when they do, the available data do not allow establishing trends nor conducting comparisons across countries. The difficulties related to the recording of such crimes are discussed and a proposal for a tripartite classification of crimes that distinguishes between offline, online, and hybrid crimes is advanced, together with suggestions on the statistical counting rules that could be applied to measure the frequency of cyber-related offences. Finally, a review of the available victimization surveys shows that cybercrime could currently represent between one-third and half of the crimes committed in a country. Accordingly, the authors consider that the rise of online and hybrid crimes have contributed to the drop of offline crimes. This is a consequence of the development of the Internet, which changed the lifestyle and routine activities of the population, and opened a breach in traditional police-based crime prevention strategies. The new scenario helped consolidating the private security market and, indirectly, led the companies involved to hold a strategic data collection, which could be used to study cybercrime.
As the war against cybercrime continues, security experts and attackers improve their skills and tools to accomplish their desired goal. Botnets have been the method of choice for a majority of cyber attacks, from phishing and spam campaigns to full scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The application of machine learning methods to help fight cybercrime has shown promising results. Unlike other domains where machine learning (ML) has been applied, there is another human being capable of using the same tools to counter the security experts. ML models are more effective at analyzing a large amount of traffic than human beings, but providing a black box response is not sustainable against dynamic human opponents. In this paper we begin to describe a method that presents the underlying patterns discovered by ML methods that allow researchers and experts to gain the insight needed to effectively design more robust responses to the ever-changing threats with which they are faced.
With the global diffusion of cybercrime, the ever-growing market penetration of high-performance and low-cost personal digital devices, and the commercial success of cloud computing, the area of digital forensics is faced with various new challenges that must be taken seriously. In this chapter, the authors describe a novel approach to digital investigations based on the emerging Forensics as a Service (FaaS) model. This model attempts to optimize Law Enforcement Agency's (LEA) forensic procedures, reduce complexity, and save operational costs. Inspired by previous work on distributed computing for forensic analysis, this chapter provides the reader with design guidelines of a FaaS platform for secure service delivery. The proposed FaaS platform should be able to support investigators and practitioners in their daily tasks (e.g. digital evidence examination, analysis, and reporting) once implemented by a cloud forensic provider or internally by a LEA. In this chapter, the authors also present the architecture components, interfaces, communication protocols, functional and non-functional requirements, as well as security specifications of the proposed framework in detail.
Increasing public awareness of cyberbullying, coupled with several highly publicized youth suicides linked to electronic bullying, have led lawmakers and politicians to consider new criminal legislation specifically related to cyberbullying. However, little is known about how the police currently respond to cyberbullying, and it is not clear whether new laws are necessary. In this article, the authors draw upon in-depth interviews with Canadian street patrol officers and school resource officers to explore police perspectives on policing cyberbullying. In contrast to the reactive hard-line approach proposed in much legislation and public discussion, police officers prefer to take a preventative approach by educating youth and raising awareness about the dangers of digital communications. Although there are instances when criminal charges must be laid, these incidents transcend bullying, a term that has little legal meaning for police officers.
Often overlooked in the measurement of crime is the underlying size of offender populations. This holds true for online property crimes involving the sale, purchase, and use of stolen financial data. Though available data suggests that online frauds are steadily increasing, there are currently no estimates of the scope of this offender population. The current study addresses this issue by using capture-recapture methods to estimate the size of the population participating in stolen data markets over a calendar year. Data analysis involved samples collected from three websites that facilitate financial crimes and frauds. Findings suggest that markets are much larger in size than what can otherwise be observed, are heterogeneous, and that buyers outnumber vendors.
The growth in technology usage came along with many risks and increase in cybercrimes incidents. Phishing attacks are a form of cybercrimes by which attackers trick victims in order to obtain personal and sensitive information. Phishers motivations include gaining unauthorized information and access, cause financial loss and many more negative impacts. While cybercriminals keep developing their techniques, investigating different attack styles and methodologies are important steps toward developing effective protection mechanisms. This paper contributes to this direction by presenting and analyzing various phishing attack styles including Nigerian, Ghanaian, Chinese and Russian cybercrime styles. Due to richness of learning resources Russians and Chinese were found to be using more advanced techniques than Ghanaians and Nigerians who has limited resources.
As cybercrime activity continues to increase with significant data growth and the Internet of Things (IoT's), this research introduces a new proactive methodically designed approach vs. current reactive and specialized methods. A novel holistic identity classification scheme and information architecture is proposed. This approach has an adaptive, common cybernetic trait design to support a changing technological landscape and human behavior. Common cyber identity base trait dimensions for context, physical, cyber, and human aspects allow for systematic analysis of temporal evidence to help resolve a physical person's identity in a cybercrime. This research platform supports both broad and targeted identity analytics utilizing advanced machine learning methods with mixed media visualizations to facilitate Cyber Situational Awareness (SA). Early PhD experimentation with real-world use cases shows promise with regard to providing salient attributes and patterns of cyber activity that are unique to a person.
Some economies in the Former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe (FSU&CEE) are known as cybercrime hotspots. FSU&CEE economies have shown complex and varied responses to cybercrimes due partly to the differential incentives and pressures they face. This study builds upon literatures on white-collar crime, institutional theory and international relations (IR)/international political economy (IPE) perspectives to examine the low rates of prosecution and conviction of suspected cybercriminals in some economies in the FSU&CEE and variation in such rates across these economies. The findings indicate that cybercrime cases are more likely to be prosecuted and sanctions are imposed in economies that are characterized by a higher degree of cooperation and integration with the West. Cybercriminals are less likely to be jurisdictionally shielded in such economies. Our findings also suggest that a high degree of cooperation and integration with the West would lead to access to resources to enhance system capacity and law enforcement performance to fight cybercrimes.
Although researchers have examined sexual solicitation of minors online, there is limited research on the content and patterns of victim-offender chats. These chats have potential use in investigations for triaging and prioritising cases, enhancing understanding of offenders, developing treatments, and crafting education and policy to prevent sexual solicitation of minors online. As part of a broader effort on Internet crimes against children (ICAC), we examine offender chat logs, email threads, and social network posts from state and local task forces on ICAC for a sample of 200 offenders in communications with undercover officers. We use mixed-methods analyses to identify key elements in these cases and propose a typology of online solicitation offenders: cybersex-only offenders, schedulers, cybersex/schedulers, and buyers. These findings provide support and expansion of existing research on offender types using a larger and more geographically diverse sample. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.
The subject of this article is global cybercrime. The relevance of the topic is increasing, as, globally, law enforcement agencies have noticed an increase in cyber crimes due to their use by organized individuals and criminal groups. The author comes to the conclusion that, in addition to the transformation of methods and techniques for committing cyber crimes, there is a change in the characteristics of cybercriminals themselves. In the article, the author notes that it is possible to observe major changes in the field of cyber threats against financial institutions and the emergence of new cybercriminal groups. Thus, even though there is consensus among most countries in the world as to the importance and relevance of combating cyber crime, which presupposes a constant and coordinated response, this problem in itself cannot be described within quantitative limits in the same way as various forms practical implementation. of cybercrime in the world cannot be described either.
Phishing was introduced in 1996, and now phishing is the biggest cybercrime challenge. Phishing is an abstract way to deceive users over the internet. Purpose of phishers is to extract the sensitive information of the user. Researchers have been working on solutions of phishing problem, but the parallel evolution of cybercrime techniques have made it a tough nut to crack. Recently, machine learning-based solutions are widely adopted to tackle the menace of phishing. This survey paper studies various feature selection method and dimensionality reduction methods and sees how they perform with machine learning-based classifier. The selection of features is vital for developing a good performance machine learning model. This work is comparing three broad categories of feature selection methods, namely filter, wrapper, and embedded feature selection methods, to reduce the dimensionality of data. The effectiveness of these methods has been assessed on several machine learning classifiers using k-fold cross-validation score, accuracy, precision, recall, and time.
Cyberbullying is a form of psychological abuse, which is very dangerous as the victims of cyberbullying, especially children and teenagers, suffer from many mental issues that could lead to suicide thoughts. Cyberbullying is also becoming a significant issue in the Middle East. Existing contributions for cyberbullying detection focus mainly on English language. This paper presents an approach to detect cyberbullying in Arabic Twitter streams in real-time. In addition, it classifies the bullying messages based on their strength. In case a cyberbullying message is detected, the system notifies the user and proposes a set of actions to take based on the strength of the bullying message. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach by showing how it could be used by a parent to monitor his kids' activities and get notified in case a suspicious activity is detected. The experiments show that the proposed system was able to effectively identify the cyberbullying messages in near real-time.
In recent years, some aggressive actions against cyber-criminals and terrorists have come not only from state actors, but also from independent third parties such as Anonymous. These groups have claimed some significant victories in their battles against ISIS and similar organizations, by hacking their email, publicly exposing their secret communications, and knocking their websites offline. The hacker groups also combat other cyber criminals, including distributors of child pornography. Some of the groups' activities, however, violate the computer hacking laws of many nations. Some commentators have criticized these statutes, claiming that the laws unnecessarily prohibit private actors from serving the public good. In this Essay, I defend the broad prohibition of cyber-vigilantism, and argue that well-intentioned private actors can accomplish their goals by working with governments. I first review global jurisprudence, case studies, and academic commentary to explain why courts and policymakers historically have disfavoured vigilantism in other contexts, and I apply that reasoning to cyberspace. I explain that cyber-vigilantism can lead to several negative consequences, including the potential for abuse of the system, undercutting the legitimacy of democratic systems, and disproportionate punishments that are not necessarily effective. I then argue that instead of operating independently, these private groups can more effectively collaborate with governments and other private actors to fight threats in cyberspace.

The escalating dependence on information technology for daily activities ensures that cybercrime cases continue unabated. Consequently, the role of cyber forensics investigators is becoming increasingly crucial in addressing the surge of cybercrime incidents. Live forensics investigation, a challenging facet of digital evidence investigation, confronts several limitations. This study focuses on the complexities associated with retrieving digital evidence from volatile memory during live forensics investigations, explicitly comparing the efficacy of extracting digital evidence from DDR2 and DDR3 Random Access Memory (RAM). This study aims to analyze and compare potential variations in evidence acquisition outcomes between the two RAM types by applying three distinct scenarios: identifying registry and network activities, catching malicious codes, and obtaining login passwords on Social Media. The results demonstrate that DDR2 RAM exhibits a lower propensity for concealing digital evidence during live forensics investigations compared to DDR3 RAM. The implications of these findings are discussed, along with suggestions for potential ramifications and avenues for future research.
"This paper explores how cyber threats are represented in Swedish newspapers. The sample comprises 1269 articles from three newspapers (Aftonbladet, Gateborgs-Posten, and Svenska Dagbladet) covering 25 years (1995-2019). The study provides a text-near and detailed analysis of the threats covered. The study analyzes these threats along several dimensions: their modality (e.g. unauthorized access or manipulation); to what extent ambiguous themes (e.g. attack, crime, and warfare) are specified in context; how cyber-threat coverage has changed over time; and the event orientation of the coverage, i.e. whether articles address topical events and, if so, which ones. There are five main findings. First, the Swedish newspaper cybersecurity discourse covers multiple threats; in total, 34 themes (present in at least 4% of articles) have been identified. Second, the representation of cyber threats varies in specificity. While generic themes such as attack and warfare are mostly specified in terms of their modality, they sometimes are not, leaving the representation vague. Third, this study, given its general approach, provides insights into media representations of particular cyber threats. For example, this study finds the meaning of hacking in the media to be more diversified and nuanced than previously assumed (e.g. as simply meaning computer breakin). Fourth, newspaper coverage of cyber threats has changed over time, in both quantity (i.e. the amount of coverage has increased) and quality, as three general trends have been observed: the state-ification and militarization of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. nations and warfare as threats), the organization-ification of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. government agencies and companies as threats), and the diversification and hyping of threats (i.e. cumulatively more threats are added to the cybersecurity discourse, although attention to particular threats is sometimes restricted in time). Finally, parallel to coverage of particular topical events (e.g. the I love you virus), newspaper representations of cyber threats largely exemplify amplification without the event, i.e. threats are covered without linking them to topical events, as is otherwise typical of news reports. The findings in relation to previous studies of cybersecurity discourse and the implications for informal learning and threat perception are discussed."
This article addresses the problem of international law enforcement within the War on Cyberterrorism. Hybrid conflicts have replaced the traditional ones, and new threats have emerged in cyberspace, which has become a virtual battlefield. Cyber threats - cybercrimes, cyberterrorism, cyberwarfare - are a major concern for Western governments, especially for the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The international community has begun to consider cyberattacks as a form of terrorism, to which the same measures apply. Because the term terrorism is ambiguous and legaly undefined, there is no consensus on a definition of the derivative term cyberterrorism, which is left to the unilateral interpretations of states. Pretending to consider the cyberspace domain as traditional domains, and claiming to apply IHL for the sole purpose of lawfully using armed forces in contrast to cyberterrorism is a stretch. This paper addresses the question of whether or not current laws of war and international humanitarian law apply to cyber domain, and gives some recommendations on how to tackle this issue.
Globe is developing rapidly, and the human and technology have become the heart and soul of each other. Now the era is of online platforms and social media. Cybercrimes are those crimes which are committed by the use of internet mainly. Cyber criminals are much more technologically advanced and smarter than the conventional criminals which makes it difficult for the relevant authorities to catch and penalize them. Despite the laws in force, the cyber criminals always keep trying to find the loop holes to sneak out and save themselves after committing the crimes. The present paper will elucidate the concept, elements and kinds of cybercrimes and will also analyze role of judiciary in fighting the cybercrimes. Further, the statistical data of cybercrimes is analyzed and certain astounding outcomes have been inculcated herein.
Proactive forensics uses the investigative principles of digital forensics to develop automated techniques that prevent cybercrime. One such prevention-minded methodology is PROFORMA, a prototype system that continuously evaluates the trustworthiness and risk of social communications.
Cybersecurity has been attracting a lot of attention lately in EU. Cybersecurity is a top priority as a necessary condition for EU's Digital Single Market. Recent EU and Greek activity in the field resulted in the current legislation on cybersecurity, which was adopted after a long law-making process aiming at the modernization of the institutional framework for combating cybercrime. This process brought forward significant as well as indispensable amendments. Full implementation of the newly voted texts demands various initiatives for the implementation of an institutional framework that will include inter alia the development of official structures and methods of response to events that threaten the security of information systems by criminal acts. This chapter analyses these, the new EU cybersecurity legislative framework with reference to its Greek implementation, and describes the major key players in combating cybercrime and traces the remaining challenges.
Illicit crypto-mining leverages resources stolen from victims to mine cryptocurrencies on behalf of criminals. While recent works have analyzed one side of this threat, i.e.: web-browser crypto-jacking, only commercial reports have partially covered binary-based crypto-mining malware. In this paper, we conduct the largest measurement of crypto-mining malware to date, analyzing approximately 4.5 million malware samples (1.2 million malicious miners), over a period of twelve years from 2007 to 2019. Our analysis pipeline applies both static and dynamic analysis to extract information from the samples, such as wallet identifiers and mining pools. Together with OSINT data, this information is used to group samples into campaigns. We then analyze publicly-available payments sent to the wallets from mining-pools as a reward for mining, and estimate profits for the different campaigns. All this together is is done in a fully automated fashion, which enables us to leverage measurement-based findings of illicit crypto-mining at scale. Our profit analysis reveals campaigns with multi-million earnings, associating over 4.4% of Monero with illicit mining. We analyze the infrastructure related with the different campaigns, showing that a high proportion of this ecosystem is supported by underground economies such as Pay-Per-Install services. We also uncover novel techniques that allow criminals to run successful campaigns.
Due to the advancement in industry 4.0, cybercrimes in internet-based business applications are rapidly increasing. To encounter such attacks, the intruders use various tools and techniques such as Phishing, Malware, SQL Injection, Ransomware, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), Session Hijacking, and Credential Reuse. Phishing is most commonly in practice in the current digital era. Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information from deceiving users. These types of cyber-attacks are used to harm individuals or entire businesses depending on the targeted objective of the attacker. To combat these attacks, the research community provides various phishing detection techniques. In this article, we classify state-of-the-art fishing detection techniques in five major categories, that are, (1) Data Mining, Deep Learning & Machine Learning-Based Approach, (2) Search Engine-Based Approach, (3) URL Scan-Based Approach, (4) Blacklisting-Whitelisting Approach, and (5) Visual Similarity-Based Approach. Further, a comparative analysis is provided within each category concerning their strength and weaknesses. Moreover, the article provides phishing prevention best practices to the readers to avoid such attacks.
In September 2019, 600 armed German cops seized the physical premise of a Bulletproof Hoster (BPH) referred to as CyberBunker 2.0. The hoster resided in a decommissioned NATO bunker and advertised to host everything but child porn and anything related to terrorism while keeping servers online no matter what. While the anatomy, economics and interconnection-level characteristics of BPHs are studied, their traffic characteristics are unknown. In this poster, we present the first analysis of domains, web pages, and traffic captured at a major tier-1 ISP and a large IXP at the time when the CyberBunker was in operation. Our study sheds light on traffic characteristics of a BPH in operation. We show that a traditional BGP-based BPH identification approach cannot detect the CyberBunker, but find characteristics from a domain and traffic perspective that can add to future identification approaches.
The recent introduction of thousands of cryptocurrencies in an unregulated environment has created many opportunities for unscrupulous traders to profit from price manipulation. We quantify the scope of one widespread tactic, the ''pump and dump, in which actors coordinate to bid up the price of coins before selling at a profit. We joined all relevant channels on two popular group-messaging platforms, Telegram and Discord, and identified thousands of different pumps targeting hundreds of coins. We find that pumps are modestly successful in driving short-term price rises, but that this effect has diminished over time. We also find that the most successful pumps are those that are most transparent about their intentions. Combined with evidence of concentration among a small number of channels, we conclude that regulators have an opportunity to effectively crack down on this illicit activity that threatens broader adoption of blockchain technologies.
Recent advancements in Cyber Security have amalgamated the strengths of Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence for Intrusion Detection. The colossal increase in the volume of new malware generated everyday and the constant risk of zero day attacks demand research for a robust malware detection system. Significant research has gone into exploring the use of Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). There has been a transition from using Malware byte information for Machine Learning and Deep Learning based methods to using an Image based Intrusion Detection system for better assessment of the malware file. Though CNNs have helped in capturing local features, Attention based mechanisms play a vital role in detecting structural changes in malware. In this paper, we have explored the use of Residual Attention for malware detection and have compared this with the existing CNN based methods and conventional Machine Learning algorithms using GIST features. The proposed method could efficiently focus the 'attention' to precisely those sections of the malware which were significant in being distinguished from benign files, thus reducing the False Positives which is primary from the Accessibility point of view in Cyber Security. The method is robust against structural changes in malware and has outperformed traditional malware detection methods by demonstrating an accuracy of 99.25%.
This study examines the perceptions of police constables and sergeants across England and Wales regarding the nature of cybercrimes, their frequency, and any time spent investigating these offences each week. Though previous research has examined line officer views and police management in the US, there is limited research examining how constables view online crimes as they are being directed to address them through national policy, and through local demands from the citizens they serve. The results demonstrated that constables engaged with online offences in the field, though they differ on the nature of online crimes and their impact on the general public. They also viewed online crimes as frequent problems, though they spend a relatively small proportion of their time each week responding to these cases.
"Communication over the internet has removed historical and social challenges such as distance, noise, or prolonged delivery time, thus, moving communication from the physical space to cyberspace. It has led to an increase in the use of the internet to commit hate crimes. The impact of hateful crimes is documented in the literature, with limited success stories on currently deployed intervention. A framework that classifies the harmful effect of Cyberhate is proposed. It aims to enrich our knowledge of the harm from Cyberhate crimes, enhance existing intervention, and provide harm metrics to prosecute cyberhate offenders. To date, limited research has quantified the harmful impact of Cyberhate crime; hence, understanding the harm from Cyberhate would provide a new perspective, with the harm concepts an area argued to currently being understudied."
There is a lack of research on gang members' online behavior. The present study addresses this shortcoming by examining how gang members proactively use the Internet. Data were collected by means of in-depth, semistructured interviews with gang members. In addition, based on reports of gang members, the analysis focused on their group activity on the web. The findings reveal that the Internet does neither play a role in gang formation nor promote considerable changes in group traditional delinquency. However, it does influence socializing processes: Youths who have high-level computer knowledge provide guidance to others, which increases online delinquency. Moreover, the level of computer skills is a key factor in gang involvement in cybercrime: for gangs with members who have high-level computer skills, online delinquency becomes a routine part of the gang's life, and interaction with other groups around the globe facilitates their involvement in cybercrime.
Digital forensics-related investigations have been a relative competitive research area by the computer specialists or law enforcement agency officers to confirm or refuse the assumptions with respect to the cybercrime scenes. WeChat is one of the most popular instant messaging application programs in contemporary age. While applying WeChat, there is precious information deposited in the computing devices that could be supportive evidences in a court of law. Hence, this research is focusing on the application of WeChat on the desktop PC under Windows 7 by means of the acquisition of volatile digital evidences in order to provide supporting information for some cybercrime cases. This paper provides generic investigation methods conducting forensic sound analysis on WeChat from the aspect of data volatility of the computing devices. By means of the proposed methodologies, the digital forensics specialists should be able to gather critical digital traces to confirm the previous actions of a WeChat user or even to reconstruct the crime scene to prove the suspect is guilty or innocent in a court of law.

Gathering evidence in cybercrime is a complex process. Under this premise, it is very important to have cutting-edge methodologies that allow the observation of criminal phenomena on the Internet and protect the personal integrity of the investigator, especially when the content is extremely critical and is located in the so-called dark zone of the Internet (hereinafter Dark Web). This article develops a new research methodology in the field of cybercrime based on the use of honeypots, and its main objective is to evaluate the ability to de-anonymize users in the Tor network to collect geographic coordinates and demographic data on the Dark Web in order to obtain digital evidence related to minors sexual (CSEM) offenders. The information collected aims to map the consumption of CSEM through cartograms, with a particular focus on the Spanish territory. The outcomes demonstrate the ability of using honeypots to assess the prevalence of CSEM consumption on the Dark Web. Future improvements of the methodology will be discussed.
Since financial institutions are leading targets of cyber attacks, the article's main goal is to show that without dedicated action, the global financial system will only be-come more vulnerable as innovation, competition, and the pandemic further fuel the digital revolution. Also, the cost of cybercrime at financial institutions outpaces the cost of cy-bercrime in other industries. For example, according to a 2019 private study, the per-company cost of cybercrime is over $18 million for financial services companies, around 40% higher than the average cost for other sectors. If the en-tire system fails to address cybersecurity concerns adequately, this could lead to systemic risk - the risk that a cybersecurity incident would destabilize the financial system. The article considers the level of protection of confidential information in financial enterprises and the means of combating data leaks. In addition, the question of the need for an information technology audit, especially a cybersecurity audit, is raised.
In this paper we describe the roadmapping methodology we developed in the context of the CyberROAD EU FP7 project, whose aim is to develop a research roadmap for cybercrime and cyber terrorism. To this aim we built on state-of-the-art methodologies and available guidelines, including related projects, and adapted them to the peculiarities of our roadmapping subject. In particular, its distinctive feature is that cybercrime and cyber terrorism co-evolve with their contextual environment (i.e., technology, society, politics and economy), which poses specific challenges to a roadmapping effort. Our approach can become a best practice in the field of cybersecurity, and can be also generalised to phenomena that exhibit a similar, strong co-evolution with their contextual environment. We aim to describe here the roadmapping methodology that will lead to the roadmap but not the roadmap itself (this one being, incidentally, still under construction at the time of writing this paper).
Coping with cybercrime in the scope of increasingly open and interconnected systems is a difficult challenge. DevSecOps provide an adequate framework to keep in control of this perpetual race. We show here how it can be efficiently supported by an internal model-based analysis and automation approach together with the external threat intelligence sharing.
Growth of cyber attacks is rapidly increasing in the entire world. To provide prevention from these attacks is a great challenge for the experts. Intruders are keep on adapting new methods and techniques to carry out their malicious goals. Phishing plays a dominant role in the field of web attacks and it has been used as a weapon by the attackers. In this paper we have given two algorithmic approaches to the problem of Phishing identification with reduced number of attributes. It makes this approach simple yet efficient. The first algorithm assigns weight to all attributes with respect to uniform resource locators. We have employed various analysis mechanism to identify significant role of selected attributes for the purpose of Phishing identification. The second approach takes former's output as input and classifies the uniform resource locators labeling as phishing or non phishing. The experimental work verifies that the approach for phishing detection proposed in this paper can attain a high accuracy in comparison to existing algorithms.
Web applications provide information for various private organizations and public sectors. The flaws in web-based application and database can also be utilized for malicious SQL statements. Aggressors often exploit SQL injection (SQLi) flaws during an input validation of web applications to infect database servers and launch cyber-attacks. SQLi attacks derive from the execution of an untrusted input and make the program execute unintended codes with administrative privileges. Website administrators should mitigate SQLi vulnerabilities and LEAs should find a better way to collect relevant evidence. This paper proposes a framework of SQLi Investigation Architecture (SIA) and proves its feasibility in fighting against of SQLi attacks. An effective and efficient approach is also proposed to prosecute SQLi aggressors and keep them away from abusing the database.
Forensic investigations increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI/ML) to identify illegal activities on bitcoin. bitcoin transactions have an original graph (network) structure, which is sophisticated and yet informative. However, machine learning applications on bitcoin have given limited attention to developing end-to-end deep learning frameworks that are modeled to exploit the bitcoin graph structure. To identify illegal transactions on bitcoin, the current paper extracts nineteen features from the bitcoin network and proposes a deep learning-based graph neural network model using spectral graph convolutions and transaction features. The proposed model is compared with two state-of-the-art techniques, viz., a graph attention network (GAT2) and an extreme gradient boosted decision tree (XGBOOST) trained on convoluted features for classification of illegal transactions on bitcoin. To understand the efficacy of the proposed model, a dataset is collected consisting of 13310125 transactions of 2059 entities having 3152202 bitcoin account addresses and belonging to 28 categories of users. Two sets of experiments are performed on the datasets: labeling transactions as legal or illegal (binary classification) and identifying the originator of the transaction to one of the twenty-eight types of entities (multi-class classification). For fast and accurate decisions, binary classification is appropriate, and for pinpointing the category of bitcoin users, a multi-class classifier is suitable. On both the tasks, the proposed models achieved a maximum of 92% accuracy, validating the methodology and suitability of the model for real-world deployment.
Based on the history of terrorism, its concept and methods of counter-acting it in Russia, the authors research the problems of an active incorporation of modern information-telecommunication technologies in all spheres of social life, manifested in the emergence of considerable risks and threats to public safety. These technologies are analyzed as a means that provides terrorists with extra opportunities for involving new people in their criminal activities, for radicalization, illegal financing, creation of an attractive image of terrorism, new ways of committing, planning, organizing and coordinating terrorist groups in a remote mode, as well as for the collection and transfer of information, etc. These technologies are studied as a powerful instrument of manipulating public conscience and behavior that can effectively influence the public opinion and create a public image of the all-powerfulness of terror. The goal of this research is to study the concept of terrorism, its history in Russia, its causes and conditions, as well as to provide theoretical recommendations for its prevention. The method of content analysis of the works of Russian and foreign authors is used to achieve this goal. The key results of this work consist in identifying the causes of the emergence and spread of terrorism at different historical stages, as well as the system of informational counteraction to terrorism. The authors con-clude that counteracting terrorism in the conditions of digitization through a prohibi-tion of internet content with unlawful information is not fully possible and that such counteraction should be aimed at influencing the world view and legal conscience of people to eliminate the support for terrorism. The novelty of the work consists in the authors' identification of the causes of terrorism, the development of suggestions aimed at counteracting terrorism in the conditions of the digitization of criminality and presented as various projects and actions that should be implemented on the territory of the whole country.
Compromising social network accounts has become a profitable course of action for cybercriminals. By hijacking control of a popular media or business account, attackers can distribute their malicious messages or disseminate fake information to a large user base. The impacts of these incidents range from a tarnished reputation to multi-billion dollar monetary losses on financial markets. In our previous work, we demonstrated how we can detect large-scale compromises (i.e., so-called campaigns) of regular online social network users. In this work, we show how we can use similar techniques to identify compromises of individual high-profile accounts. High-profile accounts frequently have one characteristic that makes this detection reliable-they show consistent behavior over time. We show that our system, were it deployed, would have been able to detect and prevent three real-world attacks against popular companies and news agencies. Furthermore, our system, in contrast to popular media, would not have fallen for a staged compromise instigated by a US restaurant chain for publicity reasons.
With the growth of Web 2.0, online communication and social networks are emerging. This alternation helps users to share their information and collaborate with each other easily. In addition, these internet services help establish new connections between persons or reinforce existing ones. However, they can also lead to misbehaviors or cyber criminal acts for example, cyberbullying. At the same time, it can make children and adolescents to use the technologies for the intention of harming another person. Due to the negative effect of cyberbullying, some techniques and methods are proposed to overcome this problem. This paper illustrates a survey covering some methods and challenges in cyberbullying. Next, we offer suggestions for continued research in this area.
Cybercriminals use a variation of techniques to fleece their digital footprints, that creates a barrier for law enforcement agencies to impossibly catch and prosecute them. With the known universal truth that whenever a machine tries to connect in adversely to target system. The victim's machine can see only requests coming from the proxy or the VPN server. Now as VPN hides IP addresses it leads the network to be redirected through some special configured remote server which are run by a VPN host. As its consequences, the user's digital footprint is hidden. the footprint of a VPN server is received by the receiver. This challenges the entire organization or one's personal system to be in risk. One such solution to the problem is to design Honeypot system that will trace an IP address running behind VPN/proxy servers. The machine learning algorithm will able to trace the actual IP address with ISP details. The paper discusses a detection mechanism that will dupe the attackers. Showing inability in locating and identifying real honeypot file. The methods were tested on various platforms and technique outperform in detecting attacker's system smartly using machine learning.
In the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, users can deterministically derive the private keys used for transmitting money from a password. Such brain wallets are appealing because they free users from storing their private keys on untrusted computers. Unfortunately, they also enable attackers to conduct unlimited offline password guessing. In this paper, we report on the first large-scale measurement of the use of brain wallets in Bitcoin. Using a wide range of word lists, we evaluated around 300 billion passwords. Surprisingly, after excluding activities by researchers, we identified just 884 brain wallets worth around $100K in use from September 2011 to August 2015. We find that all but 21 wallets were drained, usually within 24 h but often within minutes. We find that around a dozen drainers are competing to liquidate brain wallets as soon as they are funded. We find no evidence that users of brain wallets loaded with more bitcoin select stronger passwords, but we do find that brain wallets with weaker passwords are cracked more quickly.
We investigate the practice of websites selling counterfeit goods. We inspect web search results for 225 queries across 25 brands. We devise a binary classifier that predicts whether a given website is selling counterfeits by examining automatically extracted features such as WHOIS information, pricing and website content. We then apply the classifier to results collected between January and August 2014. We find that, overall, 32% of search results point to websites selling fakes. For 'complicit' search terms, such as replica rolex, 39% of the search results point to fakes, compared to 20% for 'innocent' terms, such as hermes buy online. Using a linear regression, we find that brands with a higher street price for fakes have higher incidence of counterfeits in search results, but that brands who take active countermeasures such as filing DMCA requests experience lower incidence of counterfeits in search results. Finally, we study how the incidence of counterfeits evolves over time, finding that the fraction of search results pointing to fakes remains remarkably stable.
"The term 'Cloud' is a misnomer that diverts attention from the level of conceptual clarification that is needed to understand the implications of cloud technologies upon criminal behavior, crime analysis and also law enforcement. Cloud technologies have increased computing power and storage capacity whilst reducing the cost of computing; all are qualities that have not been lost on criminals who have been using them to commit DDoS attacks, Data theft, mass spam attacks and other mass cyber-dependent crimes. This paper offers a framework for conceptualising cybercrimes in the cloud (cloud crimes) and for understanding how they drive offenders and affect victims. It also outlines the key challenges for law enforcement."
The increase in number and types of various stakeholders interacting with self-driving vehicles expands the relevant automotive cybersecurity attack vectors that can be compromised. Furthermore, given the prominent role that human behavior plays in the lifetime of a vehicle, social and human-based factors must be considered in tandem with the technical factors when addressing cybersecurity. A focus on informing and enabling stakeholders and their corresponding actions promotes security of the vehicle through a human-focused and technology-enabled approach. Example stakeholders include the consumer operating the vehicle, the technicians working on the car, and the engineers designing the software. Strategies can be applied in both a social and technical manner to increase preventative security measures for autonomous vehicles by leveraging theoretical foundations from the criminology domain. In this work we harness a criminology theory approach to crime prevention, where we synergistically combine cybercrime theory, human factors, and technical solutions to develop a cybercrime prevention framework that accounts for a range of stakeholders relevant to an autonomous vehicle domain.
"Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals' susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale's construct validity and reconfirm its reliability. We present a valid and reliable modular psychometric tool that measures general susceptibility to persuasive techniques. Since its inception, we have successfully implemented the StP-II scale to measure susceptibility to persuasion of IT security officers, the role of psychology of persuasion in cybercrime victims and general persuadability levels of Facebook users; these manuscripts are in preparation. We argue that the StP-II scale shows promise in measuring individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, and is applicable across diverse contexts such as Internet security and cybercrime."
Smart mobile phones are, nowadays, in wide use and day by day they are transformed into an essential part of everyday life, for business and for entertainment alike. Mobile Networks have been implemented in order to serve these needs. Unfortunately there are many users who want to use the benefits that technology gives to them for malicious and/or illegal actions. In this paper we present and analyze a hypothetical (but realistic) cybercrime investigation scenario. According to this, a user who has wireless internet access using a mobile phone through a University's network facilities, visits sites with pornographic content. A fact that complicates the analysis of the scenario is that the user employs anti-forensics techniques (e. g. data encryption). In this paper we show how to apply to the investigation of this scenario (as well as similar ones) a number of widely available open source forensics analysis tools overcoming the anti-forensics efforts of malicious users. Our goal is to demonstrate their applicability to cybercrime forensics and their capability to operate in a complementary, to each other, way so that their deployment sheds light to different aspects of the case at hand.
"Few studies have examined crime on Snapchat despite its popularity and growing accounts of victimization occurring on the application. This study addresses this gap in knowledge by conducting a rapid review of crime on Snapchat across 18 databases. The findings indicate this area is under-researched, with only 35 articles eligible for inclusion and five focusing solely on crime on Snapchat. Nevertheless, eleven types of crimes were identified as occurring on Snapchat, including: blackmail; the sharing of private, sexual material without consent; grooming/solicitation of minors; stalking; posting threatening, intimidating or harassing material; hate crime; sharing offensive, menacing or obscene content; obtaining illicit goods; identity theft; fraud; and hacking. The findings additionally revealed some patterns in offending and victimization that are also discussed."
With a dynamic business environment and the development of information technology, managers have to make the right decisions that give them an advantage in the competitive market. Enterprises operate in the era of the threat of cyber-attacks, where it is important to quickly and efficiently respond to incidents. Ensuring information security has become a strategic necessity for all entrepreneurs. Identification of needs, achieving an appropriate level and maintaining and improving information security is an essential element to maintain a competitive market position, financial liquidity, profitability, compliance with legal requirements, and a positive corporate image. Protecting information is, therefore, a prerequisite for the operation of enterprises. The article indicates the important role played by ensuring information security in enterprises. The state of activities in the field of ensuring data and information security in the SME sector was determined based on the conducted research.
The continuing adoption of technologies by the general public coupled with the expanding reliance of critical infrastructures connected through the Internet has created unique opportunities for attacks by civilians and nation-states alike. Although governments are increasingly focusing on policies to deter nation-state level attacks, it is unclear what factors may affect citizens' decisions to engage in politically motivated cyber crime attacks against either a foreign nation-state or their own homeland. Thus, this study will explore the factors that may affect individual willingness to use technology to attack critical infrastructure online or offline using an international sample of college students. The findings compare the correlates of physical and virtual attacks, including political outlook, group equality, and involvement in cyber deviance. The implications of this research on the relationship between on- and offline infrastructure attacks will be explored in depth for policy makers, governmental agencies, and law enforcement.
The Apple iPad is a popular tablet device presented by Apple in early 2010. The idiosyncracies of this new portable device and the kind of data it may store open new opportunities in the field of computer forensics. Given that its design, both internal and external, is very similar to the iPhone, the current easiest way to obtain a forensic image is to install an SSH server and some tools, dump its internal storage and transfer it to a remote host via wireless networking. This approach may require up to 20 hours. In this paper, we present a novel approach that takes advantage of an undocumented feature so that it is possible to use a cheap iPad accessory, the Camera Connection Kit, to image the disk to an external hard drive attached via USB connection, greatly reducing the required time.

The availability of massive amounts of data, fast computers, and superior machine learning (ML) algorithms has spurred interest in artificial intelligence (AI). It is no surprise, then, that we observe an increase in the application of AI in cybersecurity. Our survey of AI applications in cybersecurity shows most of the present applications are in the areas of malware identification and classification, intrusion detection, and cybercrime prevention. We should, however, be aware that AI-enabled cybersecurity is not without its drawbacks. Challenges to AI solutions include a shortage of good quality data to train machine learning models, the potential for exploits via adversarial AI/ML, and limited human expertise in AI. However, the rewards in terms of increased accuracy of cyberattack predictions, faster response to cyberattacks, and improved cybersecurity make it worthwhile to overcome these challenges. We present a summary of the current research on the application of AI and ML to improve cybersecurity, challenges that need to be overcome, and research opportunities for academics in management information systems.
The term 'cloud computing' has begun to enter the lexicon of the legal world. The term is not new, but the implications for obtaining and retaining evidence in electronic format for the resolution of civil disputes and the prosecution of alleged criminal activities might be significantly affected in the future by 'cloud' computing. This article is an exploratory essay in assessing the effect that 'cloud' computing might have on evidence in digital format in criminal proceedings in the jurisdiction of England & Wales.

Digital data include financial documents and medical records, where security is not guaranteed. Unfortunately, cybercrime has developed for several multimedia applications. To overcome cybercrime, forensic analysis is applied. However, an increasing amount of mal-ware is embedded in video payloads, and to minimize this amount, pseudo arbitrary permutation of movable Haar wavelet coefficients (PAP-MHWC) was developed. Pseudo arbitrary permutation using a secret key is permutated to decrease the probability of malware and reduce the distortion rate. Forensic security collects log file information as verification. Haar wavelet coefficients are a sequence of square-shaped functions used in a Fourier analysis to identify cyber forensic regions in video files. Such coefficients enable working with increasingly complex files by decomposing them into various positions and scales. Video frame overlapping is removed using a translation-invariance wavelet transform, thereby improving the forensic security rate. Experiment results show that the proposed PAP-MHWC method achieves a better performance in terms of malware detection accuracy, false-positive ratio, malware detection time, and malware crime probability rate than previous methods.

This paper discusses the current issues and proposes legal remedies for removing the barriers to gathering cross-border electronic evidence in crime investigation. Crime and cyber-crime have a huge influence on our modern economy as the yearly damage is estimated to cost hundreds of billions of USD. Efficient fight against cybercrime in the interconnected society faces several barriers due to the inconsistent understanding in cross-border e-evidence search, the legality of the data sought, and the rules for cooperation with the service providers of communication services. The paper evaluates the current legal scene and the existing regulative enabling collection of cross-border electronic evidence. The attitudes and the views towards the current legal instruments enabling efficient cybercrime and crime investigation and cross-border e-evidence collection among the legal practitioners are analysed based on empirical data collected with two surveys. Answers to the research questions 'if the barriers for cross-border access to e-evidence can be removed with new regulation' are provided by analysing both the survey results and the new EU regulation for investigation, production and preservation orders.
There are minimal studies have attempted to shed light on the reality of the challenges and as such, the present paper brings forth studies identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the challenges to motivate future authors to focus on the issues affecting the domain. Accordingly, a survey was conducted among researchers and practitioners (at the level of law enforcement and organizations) in order to investigate actual challenges and differentiate them from perceived challenges for the purpose of providing insight into the effects upon digital forensic domain in the near future. The study provided and collated a compact survey of the top significant challenges highlighted in the design/development of modern digital forensics tools. The study contributes to the identification of the important, mid- and long-term opportunities and issues that need to be taken into account by the security experts and network forensics in the field investigations fields.
The global increase in violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic has been termed the 'shadow pandemic'. A study by Ravindran and Shah analysed evidence of violence against women in Indian society and find that, under strict lockdown rules, domestic violence and cybercrime complaints increased, whereas rape and sexual assault decreased.
Nowadays, big data analytics has been widely applied in addressing the growing cybercrime threats. However, energy consumption is explosive increasing with the fast growth of big data processing in anti-cybercrime. In this paper, an energy-efficient framework for big data applications is proposed to reduce energy consumption while satisfying deadline constrains. First, the problem of energy-efficient tasks scheduling of a single Spark job is modeled as an integer program. We design an energy-efficient tasks scheduling algorithm to minimize the energy consumption for big data application in Spark. To avoid service-level agreement violations for execution time, we propose an optimal task scheduling algorithm with deadline constrains by tradingoff execution time and energy consumption. Experiments on a Spark cluster are performed to determine the energy consumption and execution time for several workloads from the HiBench benchmark suite. Our algorithms consume less energy on average than FIFO and FAIR under deadlines. The optimal algorithm is able to find near optimal tasks schedules to trade off energy consumed and response time benefit in small shuffle partitions.
Data collected from a sample of Spanish non-university students (N = 4174) were used to identify unique situational profiles of self-identified repeated online harassment victims and offenders, through a Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC). Repeat victim and offender profiles were constructed using individual-level factors and variables related to the cyber places where students go online and their personal information they share while there. Clustering analysis demonstrates that students spent their time online in few situational contexts where online harassment occurs. Dominant situational profiles of students are then provided, along with their associated probabilities for experiencing repeat victimization or committing repeat offending, identifying those at relatively higher and lower risk. Results show that composite profiles associated with victims of repeated online harassment are dissimilar to those associated with offenders of repeated online harassment, suggesting that each form of online harassment occurs in different situational contexts and therefore requires different preventative measures. Our findings are discussed in terms of criminological theory, future online harassment research, cybercrime prevention, and policy implications.
The advent of Bitcoin was heralded as an innovation in the global monetary system, that could bring down transaction fees by circumventing the need for third parties and conduct transactions in real time. The divisibility of a blockchain cryptocurrency to even fractions of a cent, caused microtransactions to become feasible to formerly non-existent denominations. These microtransactions have spurred the development of novel ways of monetizing online resources and hold the potential to aid in alleviation of poverty. The paper conducts a feasibility study on Stellar as a blockchain-based micropayment system. It highlights the limitations in Stellar that impedes its progress and utilizes a characterization model for micropayment systems to evaluate the efficacy of the Stellar platform. The paper conducts a comparison with the micropayment solutions from Bitcoin, Ethereum and PayPal. The paper analyzes a subset of transactions from the Stellar blockchain to aid in drawing a conclusion on the undertaken study and elaborates on the mitigation tools to enable fraud prevention in online monetary transactions.
"Bitcoin has enjoyed wider adoption than any previous cryptocurrency; yet its success has also attracted the attention of fraudsters who have taken advantage of operational insecurity and transaction irreversibility. We study the risk that investors face from the closure of Bitcoin exchanges, which convert between Bitcoins and hard currency. We examine the track record of 80 Bitcoin exchanges established between 2010 and 2015. We find that nearly half (38) have since closed, with customer account balances sometimes wiped out. Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always. Twenty-five exchanges suffered security breaches, 15 of which subsequently closed. We present logistic regressions using longitudinal data on Bitcoin exchanges aggregated quarterly. We find that experiencing a breach is correlated with a 13 times greater odds that an exchange will close in that same quarter. We find that higher-volume exchanges are less likely to close (each doubling in trade volume corresponds to a 12% decrease in the odds of closure). We also find that exchanges that derive most of their business from trading less popular (fiat) currencies, which are offered by at most one competitor, are less likely to close."
Extensive prior research has examined the effect of low self-control on delinquency, as well as whether this effect is moderated by criminal opportunity. The purpose of our study is to examine whether these relationships can be extended to cyberbullying as an outcome. In doing so, we discuss ways in which key theoretical arguments and common measurement strategies must be modified in order to apply to cyberbullying. Using data from a nationally representative sample of South Korean youth, the analysis reveals that low self-control is, indeed, a significant predictor of cyberbullying. Moreover, we find that the effect of low self-control on cyberbullying is amplified by criminal opportunity, but only when opportunity is measured in a manner that specifically refers to the usage of social media. In contrast, opportunity as traditionally measured has no moderating effect. We suggest several avenues for future research, and conclude that studies of cybercrime must pay careful attention to conceptualizing and operationalizing key concepts with specific regard to the differences between cybercrime and traditional forms of offending.
Illegal booter services offer denial of service (DoS) attacks for a fee of a few tens of dollars a month. Internationally, police have implemented a range of different types of intervention aimed at those using and offering booter services, including arrests and website takedown. In order to measure the impact of these interventions we look at the usage reports that booters themselves provide and at measurements of reflected UDP DoS attacks, leveraging a five year measurement dataset that has been statistically demonstrated to have very high coverage. We analysed time series data (using a negative binomial regression model) to show that several interventions have had a statistically significant impact on the number of attacks. We show that, while there is no consistent effect of highly-publicised court cases, takedowns of individual booters precede significant, but short-lived, reductions in recorded attack numbers. However, more wide-ranging disruptions have much longer effects. The closure of HackForums' booter market reduced attacks for 13 weeks globally (and for longer in particular countries) and the FBI's coordinated operation in December 2018, which involved both takedowns and arrests, reduced attacks by a third for at least 10 weeks and resulted in lasting change to the structure of the booter market.
Online romance fraud is a form of cybercrime that has pervasive consequence on both individuals and organizations. As against previous studies that predominantly focus on male scammers, this study examines the influence of sociocultural experiences and technological modalities on women's involvement in online romance fraud in Tamale, Ghana. The study employs a blend of feminist criminology and Cressey's Fraud Triangle Theory to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the engagement of women in the scamming phenomenon in this region. Employing the experiences of fifteen (15) female scammers, the results show that sociocultural backgrounds of female scammers, combined with the internet's inherent opportunities, play a pivotal role in determining the engagement. The sociocultural background of women, coupled with the technological nature of the act, plays a significant role in driving their engagement in these illicit activities: motivation to offend and opportunity through social relationships. This study emphasizes how technological pathways enhance the opportunities available to women, highlighting the ways in which the digital landscape of such frauds potentially allows women to evade legal and societal repercussions. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that considers both the technological aspects and the underlying societal constructs that facilitate them.
The economic-financial crime is a complex phenomenon, with major impacts at the level of society, business environment, public institutions and it is evolving rapidly, being able to constantly adapt to current realities. The COVID-19 crisis has completely changed aspects of everyday life, but it has had effects on criminal financial behaviour, which seeks new ways to explore the current vulnerabilities of the business environment and institutions. International organizations are on the alert and are constantly looking for new tools to fight the crimes and to counteract the effects, for example Europol has constitute the European Financial and Economic Crime Center. The purpose of this article is to present the methods of financial economic crime that effects the society, the business environment and institutions such as: bribery, corruption, money laundering, fraud, cyber-attacks, the impact and the ways that the offenders adapt to the current realities and during the pandemic COVID-19.
This work presents an overview of some of the tools that cybercriminals employ to trade securely. It will look at the weaknesses of these tools and how the behavior of cybercriminals will sometimes lead them to use tools in a nonoptimal manner, creating opportunities for law enforcement to identify and apprehend them. The criminal domain this article focuses on is carding, the online trade in stolen payment card details and the consequent criminal misuse of such data. However, these findings could be applied more broadly, as many of the analyzed tools are used across (cyber) criminal domains. This article is a continuation of earlier work, in which a crime script analysis of 25 carding tutorials presented the tools that cybercriminals use to cash-out stolen payment card details while remaining anonymous. We use these tutorials and an analysis of the literature to identify how they can be used incorrectly and create a typology of potential behavioral and technological pitfalls in these tools. Finally, we conclude that finding pitfalls in the usage of tools by cybercriminals has the potential to increase the efficiency of disruption, interception, and prevention approaches. However, in future work, interviews with law enforcement experts and convicted cybercriminals or still active users should be used to analyze the operational security of cybercriminals in more depth.
This work briefly (An extended version can be found at https://kar.kent.ac.uk/id/eprint/63502) examines some of the most relevant Bitcoin Laundry Services, commonly known as tumblers or mixers, and studies their main features to try to answer some fundamental questions including their security, popularity, transaction volume, and generated revenue. Our research aims to inform both legitimate users and Law Enforcement about the characteristics and limitations of these services.
This study suggests implement issues for safe distribution in the viewpoints of governments, businesses and people as stakeholders according to transborder flows of personal information in managerial aspects and institutional aspects. This study is to choose the best policy for international cooperation system against cybercrime focused on the information management and information communication technology.
Collecting data on underground criminal communities is highly valuable both for security research and security operations. Unfortunately these communities live within a constellation of diverse online forums that are difficult to infiltrate, may adopt crawling monitoring countermeasures, and require the development of ad-hoc scrapers for each different community, making the endeavour increasingly technically challenging, and potentially expensive. To address this problem we propose THREAT/crawl, a method and prototype tool for a highly reusable crawler that can learn a wide range of (arbitrary) forum structures, can remain under-the-radar during the crawling activity and can be extended and configured at the user will. We showcase THREAT/crawl capabilities and provide prime evaluation of our prototype against a range of active, live, underground communities.
With the sharp increase of hacking attacks over the last couple of years, web application security has become a key concern. SQL injection is one of the most common types of web hacking and has been widely written and used in the wild. This paper analyzes the principle of SQL injection attacks on Web sites, presents methods available to prevent IIS + ASP + MSSQL web applications from these kinds of attacks, including secure coding within the web application, proper database configuration, deployment of IIS. The result is verified by WVS report.
Bitcoin is a new form of global digital currency based on peer-to-peer network, enabling a new payment system, and also a completely decentralised cryptocurrency. The P2P network consists of a digital file listing transactions like a ledger, a copy of which is also maintained on every computer on the network, and the transactions are also broadcasted in the public ledger of the Bitcoin network. Anonymity is the core feature that makes Bitcoin popular among people around the world. This feature is attained through the Bitcoin addresses in the public ledger, which represents the users in the Bitcoin network. Because of the illicit use of Bitcoins, the level of anonymity has reduced even though the users are still using the anonymizers like TOR to keep the anonymity stronger to connect to the Bitcoin network. In this paper, we analyse the complete process of transaction of Bitcoins and the anonymity thatlies in that process. The study also focuses on finding the forensic artefacts and the investigative way of approach towards the Bitcoin using forensic tools. The forensic tools are used to analyse the web browser activities, local drive, hard disk image, cookies, downloads and session data related to Bitcoins. The attacker can relate the transaction of the users and can control the Bitcoin blocks by even delaying the transactions. This research will focus on the methods in which the memory and even mobile devices involved in the transaction could be captured and analysed.
At its very core, the phrase criminal justice sciences points to the interdisciplinary nature of our field. However, efforts to promote and support interdisciplinary teaching and research face significant barriers. In this paper, I address how interdisciplinarity is conceptualized, the history of criminal justice as an interdisciplinary field, why we should promote interdisicplinarity, barriers we confront in interdisciplinary efforts, the degree to which ACJS members engage in interdisciplinary practices, factors related to interdisciplinarity, and opportunities for increased interdisciplinary research in criminal justice. To grow as an academic field, I conclude that we must look to other disciplines such as biology, computer science, policy, and women's studies as we expand our disciplinary boundaries.
Security challenges to telecommunication networks have been a matter of concern to the international community within the last two decades. Telecommunication infrastructure that provides the necessary backbone for information exchange such as voice, video, data, and Internet connectivity have been found to be particularly vulnerable to various forms of attacks. Some of these attacks could lead to denial of service, loss of integrity and confidentiality of network services. Protecting these networks from attacks is thus an important aspect that cannot be ignored. This paper highlights some of the important security challenges to current telecommunication networks and recommends countermeasures that can be implemented to mitigate not only infrastructural insecurity but also the risk from cyber-attacks. One of which is security by default that aims at designing systems that can repair themselves when breaches are detected.
"System trespassing by computer intruders is a growing concern among millions of Internet users. However, little research has employed criminological insights to explore the effectiveness of security means to deter unauthorized access to computer systems. Drawing on the deterrence perspective, we employ a large set of target computers built for the sole purpose of being attacked and conduct two independent experiments to investigate the influence of a warning banner on the progression, frequency, and duration of system trespassing incidents. In both experiments, the target computers (86 computers in the first experiment and 502 computers in the second) were set either to display or not to display a warning banner once intruders had successfully infiltrated the systems; 1,058 trespassing incidents were observed in the first experiment and 3,768 incidents in the second. The findings reveal that although a warning banner does not lead to an immediate termination or a reduction in the frequency of trespassing incidents, it significantly reduces their duration. Moreover, we find that the effect of a warning message on the duration of repeated trespassing incidents is attenuated in computers with a large bandwidth capacity. These findings emphasize the relevance of restrictive deterrence constructs in the study of system trespassing."
The proliferation of the internet services with pornographic character no longer surprises anyone nowadays, if we consider the expansion of this type of expression in classic mass-media. Analyzing the phenomenology of virtual pornography we can clearly identify, apart from the proliferation of contents of this type, the high degree of accessibility enjoyed by users. The easy identification of these pages by means of search engines and introducing keywords suggestion is outstanding. The need to incriminate the acts of production, possession and dissemination of child pornography through computer systems is undeniable. The extremely aggressive campaign addressed against this scourge has led to the perception of an attack against free speech in cyberspace.
Darkweb marketplaces have evolved greatly since the rise of the Silk Road in 2011, the first platform of its kind, and have become a highly profitable underground trading ecosystem, which provides anonymity for both buyers and sellers. Law enforcement along with researchers, have been successful in taking down marketplaces over the years. However, the combination of mechanisms implemented by these platforms (e.g. payment mechanisms, cryptocurrencies, trust systems), along with the success of the Tor network's anonymity properties, have made marketplaces much more enticing to users, while providing ease of access and use, as well as resilience against hostile actions. Through qualitative methods, this paper presents a mapping of darkweb marketplaces. We systematically investigate the operation of 41 marketplaces, along with 35 vendor shops, and gather information about the mechanisms and features implemented. Additionally, to acquire real world information, we explore the marketplaces' integrated forums, as well as 3 popular independent ones, focusing on discussions between vendors, buyers and marketplace owners, on topics related to illegal trading. We believe that gaining an up-to-date and deep understanding of the framework that marketplaces are built upon, is the first step towards discovering weak spots in the cyber security product and service market, with the disruption of its operation being the ultimate goal.
Password reuse has been long understood as a problem: credentials stolen from one site may be leveraged to gain access to another site for which they share a password. Indeed, it is broadly understood that attackers exploit this fact and routinely leverage credentials extracted from a site they have breached to access high-value accounts at other sites (e.g., email accounts). However, as a consequence of such acts, this same phenomena of password reuse attacks can be harnessed to indirectly infer site compromises-even those that would otherwise be unknown. In this paper we describe such a measurement technique, in which unique honey accounts are registered with individual third-party websites, and thus access to an email account provides indirect evidence of credentials theft at the corresponding website. We describe a prototype system, called Tripwire, that implements this technique using an automated Web account registration system combined with email account access data from a major email provider. In a pilot study monitoring more than 2,300 sites over a year, we have detected 19 site compromises, including what appears to be a plaintext password compromise at an Alexa top-500 site with more than 45 million active users.
Objectives. This article seeks to describe and understand the social organization as well as the distribution of recognition in the online community (also known as the warez scene) of hackers who illegally distribute intellectual property online. Method. The data were collected from an online index that curates a list of illegal content that was made available between 2003 and 2009. Sutherland's notion of behavior systems in crime as well as Boase and Wellman's notion of network individualism are used to theorize the social organization and the distribution of recognition in the warez scene. These were then analyzed using social network theory. Results. There is a strong correlation between the productivity of the hacking groups and the recognition they receive from their peers. These findings are limited by the lack of data on the internal operations of each hacking groups and by the aggregate nature of the network matrix. Conclusions. We find that hacking groups that make this online community generally have a very limited life span as well as low production levels. They work and compete in a very distributed and democratic community where we are unable to identify clear leaders.
Virtual space and all its attached Internet services, mobile applications, computers and networks are extensions of our daily needs and life. But are most of us prepared to use them in a responsible manner? The global networking can be used not only with the good intentions. Some of the problems can be avoided with an Internet-usage literacy campaign. In this way users will be aware of their rights, their duties and the dangers that may arise if they treat electronic/Internet/mobile-issues as details not worthy for their attention. With small awareness and little knowledge of how the things work, regular users can be safer in the computer wastelands, mobile frenzy and Internet services nebulae. By buying a device, which can help you to enlist/write in a social network or on a blog, the user starts to share information that can be used against ones will. An unsecured computer or network, social engineering, fake websites can be avoided even by a regular user if there is enough knowledge upon these subjects. Banning Internet or avoiding technology in general is not the key for development, but learning how to operate and understanding the processes involved is the intelligent way. Knowing your computer, understanding how the network is actually working, securing your gateways to the Internet, comprehending and smartly using the tools of the available services from the Internet or for your mobile/smart phone will not make the user a programmer or an Internet geek, but a responsible citizen in the virtual environment. Internet-literacy is a must at any age, for all that are living in the 21th century electronic and real worlds.
Romance fraud, where an offender uses the guise of a genuine relationship for monetary gain, affects millions globally. Further to financial losses, evidence suggests victims may also be targeted for sextortion, where the offender either has images or claims to possess indecent images of a person and attempts to extort them for money. Research exploring the association between romance fraud and sextortion is limited, with little known about the characteristics of victims and their potential for financial loss. This article addresses this gap through a quantitative analysis of those who reported romance fraud which included a threat of sextortion. It identifies those who paid in response to the sextortion threat by a variety of situational and demographic variables and locates this group in the broader context of romance fraud. The implications of this study for an understanding of online fraud victimization are explored in detail.
This article explores the intersections of street crimes and cybercrimes. Fourteen Dutch criminal investigations into networks that committed cybercrimes were analyzed to gain insight into offline and local dimensions of these activities. Firstly, we examined whether the networks in these cases are also involved in other criminal activities than cybercrimes. Secondly, we analyzed the origin and growth of these networks, with specific attention for the role or offline interactions on the physical streets. Thirdly, we explored whether the cases contained information that would indicate the presence of a street culture informing the activities of the offenders. Our analysis of both the criminal activities and the origin and development of the cybercriminal networks highlights the ongoing importance of the offline world. However, our results shed light on more than just the hidden face of cybercrime. Based on their linguistic practices and motives and neutralizations, we see examples of how core members, recruiters, and money mules in different cases are embedded in Dutch street culture. Our findings, therefore, indicate that cybercrime cases could also be interpreted as digital diversifications of traditional street (economic) street crimes and, thereby, as empirical examples of street offenders adapting to the rise of technology.
Emerging as a novel cybercrime, cloned (or hijacked) journals with identical ISSNs to legitimate ones have surfaced. These cloned journals employ various tactics, and this article identifies and discusses the top five. Fraudulent journals primarily focus on print-only publications, using parallel websites to mislead researchers. Cloned journals are using videos on their homepages to deceitfully showcase indexing in databases like Scopus or Web of Science.
Technology has enabled the humans to access the information as they need in their march towards progress. However, cybercrime or online crimes have never been a part of this progress. It is the misuse of social media that has contributed to the growth of cybercrime. This study attempts to make a comparison of regulatory provisions for cyber defamation being carried out through electronic-based media in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. This study used normative juridical research methods to analyze secondary data collected through library research and documentation search. The conceptual, statutory, and comparative approaches were used to analyze the data. The rationale behind this study was to find out whether there exists any legal material or redressals that could be seen as a reformation in the legislative policies regarding Crime of Cyber Defamation through media in the sampled countries. The findings confirmed that there exist several differences in the regulations related to cyber defamation laws in Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea, especially those deal with crimes committed through electronic media. The study also found out the cyber defamation crimes are classified in terms of types of offenses, elements, and definitions in each country, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea.
DeFi has attracted legitimate investors and scammers alike. The paper presents an empirical investigation into the prevalence of rug-pulls, a scam where cryptocurrency project developers exit without fully delivering and leave investors in the wind. Using forum data, 101 rugpulls from 6 different types of DeFi services are documented. ICOs form the majority of the rugpulls, most of which were active for less than six months before scamming out. ICOs rugpulled in 2021 were active for a much longer time than those that were rugpulled later on, perhaps pointing to new entrants intending to pull the rug. Through qualitative thematic analysis, we discover that these schemes primarily use authoritative and financial lures at the announcement stage of the project to mimic legitimate projects.
Reflecting a central premise of the collective securitisation model, it is argued in this article that both specific events and longer-term trends have galvanised and reinforced the EU discourse of increasing threat and risk around cybersecurity, at different points in time. Thus, whilst major cyberattacks have caused the EU to reflect with some urgency on the increasing threat and review its approach, new policy initiatives evolved incrementally thereafter, rather than being the product of any emergency action outside the EU's normal politics. It is shown further that, in the case of cybersecurity, discourses of threat and risk have continued beyond policy initiation, and that this discourse has very much run in parallel with further action and initiatives. Finally, this article demonstrates how collective securitisation and legislation in certain key areas related to cybersecurity can also be subject to EU institutional desecuritisation moves, leading to national policy differentiation following a precipitating event.
While copious amounts of information exist on the loss of personal data by various entities (government offices, colleges and universities, health-care facilities, private sector organizations and so on), very little scholarly analysis has been performed to aid our understanding of our vulnerabilities. This research utilizes a 6-year sample compiled from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse who maintain a record of all published data breaches in the United States to examine the correlates of data loss as well as how lost records are spatially distributed across the country. Advanced spatial analysis techniques were employed to achieve this goal. A thorough discussion of our current vulnerabilities is proffered given this rich data source followed by an exploration of preliminary policy implications.
Botnet malware is improving with the latest (3rd) generation exemplified by the SpyEye and Zeus botnets. These botnets are important to understand because they target online financial transactions, primarily with banks. In this paper, we analyze the components from multiple generations of the SpyEye botnet in order to understand both how it works and how it is evolving. SpyEye is a sophisticated piece of malware with a modular design that eases the incorporation of improvements. We will discuss in detail the complete framework of SpyEye botnet consisting of the Bot Development Kit (BDK), the plugin architecture, the backend storage server, the bot design and the web-based Command and Control (C&C) management system. In addition, we also examine the techniques used by SpyEye to steal money. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
"The aim of this study was an investigation of cybercrime from the point of view of Imamieh (Iran) jurisprudence. The present study is a descriptive-analytical investigation. The importance of the topic has forced the author not only to review the ideas of academics, but also to provide a foundation of recognition for cybercrime. The results show that jurists believe that acts of depravity should be prosecuted through punishment; and in some cases they have condemned it as mofsed-e-filarz, which is punishable by death. Likewise, the points of view of jurists have been investigated; research has been based on research. Through the investigations carried out, it is made clear that certain crimes that have been used by social networks to decrease chastity in society include the disclosure of adultery, pimping, pornography, etc., which have been referred to by legislators and saints imams and the Prophet.. In the first step, these crimes are not only against the offender, but also target and weaken the foundations of the most important units of any society, which are families."
This work compares machine learning methods using supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, to classify advertisements for cryptocurrency related investment scams found in the online forum Bitcointalk, and the social media platform Reddit. We extract more than 24.2 million posts from Bitcointalk and use Reddit's API to collect 2,108 submissions. We train and compare several multiclass text classification approaches and use the models with highest accuracy and F-measure to identify cryptocurrency investment scam advertisements found on both platforms. We discover around five percent of all posts collected on both sites are potential scams. We then use another text classifier to identify the scam actors involved in these investment scam advertisements. We also discover the lures used within these fraudulent adverts and find the main differences in luring techniques used between Bitcointalk and Reddit. We identify that the most prevalent lure type uses the financial principle, followed by the distraction principle in Bitcointalk, and by the authority principle in Reddit. Finally, we use subreddits as communities' proxies and compare scam advertisements within them to identify whether pensioners are being specifically targeted by cryptocurrency scam adverts. Our results show that retirement subreddits do not contain a higher number of cryptocurrency investment scam adverts compared to other investment focused subreddits.
Research has identified several strategies victims adopt to deter unwanted conduct from stalkers. Whether such strategies are effective, however, is relatively unknown. Using stalking data from the 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey, the current study examines the effectiveness of safety strategies as a deterrent and whether effects are conditioned by how victims know their stalker. Victims who restricted digital access or involved the police were more likely to report the unwanted conduct had stopped, net of victim and situational contexts. These findings were consistent regardless of whether victims were pursued by intimate partner versus non-partner stalkers. The success of strategies was not universal and what works to deter stalkers was related to victim characteristics, duration, and having access to resources.
Cyber Security assumes a critical job in the field of Information and Communication Technology [ICT]. Securing the information has become one of the greatest difficulties in the present day. When we consider cyber security, the main aspect that strikes in our mind is `cyber crimes' which are expanding enormously day by day. Different Governments and organizations are taking numerous measures so as to keep these cyber crimes. Other than different measures cyber security is as yet a big concern to many. This paper for the most part centers around difficulties looked by cyber security on the most recent technologies. It also focuses around most recent about the cyber security methods, ethics and the trends changing the appearance of cyber security. Governments, military, associations, budgetary foundations, colleges and different organizations gather, process and store a great deal of private data on PCs and transmit that data over systems to various PCs. With the tenacious quick advancement of volume and enhancement of cyberattacks, incite attempts are required to anchor touchy business and individual data, and to anchor national security. The paper talk with respect to the idea of the internet and shows how the web is unbound to transmit the mystery and budgetary data. We demonstrate that hacking is as of now typical and dangerous for overall economy and security and exhibited the diverse techniques for Cyber attacks in India and around the globe.
Research on physical, that is, violent, terror attacks and extremism has increased dramatically over the last decade. The growth of the Internet and computer technology has also led to concern over the use of cyberattacks by ideologically motivated offenders to cause harm and further their political and social agendas. There is, however, a lack of empirical research on cyber-attackers limiting our knowledge of the factors that affect their behavior. This study addresses this empirical gap through a qualitative analysis of 10 interviews conducted with ideologically motivated Turkish computer hackers. The findings demonstrated that Turkish hackers motivated by an ideological agenda reflected the larger values of the hacker subculture, though the targets for their attacks were shaped directly by religious or political beliefs. We conclude by discussing in depth our findings and implications for counterterror and cybersecurity policy and practice.
Click fraud is a scam that hits a criminal sweet spot by both tapping into the vast wealth of online advertising and exploiting that ecosystem's complex structure to obfuscate the flow of money to its perpetrators. In this work, we illuminate the intricate nature of this activity through the lens of ZeroAccess-one of the largest click fraud botnets in operation. Using a broad range of data sources, including peer-to-peer measurements, command-and-control telemetry, and contemporaneous click data from one of the top ad networks, we construct a view into the scale and complexity of modern click fraud operations. By leveraging the dynamics associated with Microsoft's attempted takedown of ZeroAccess in December 2013, we employ this coordinated view to identify ad units whose traffic (and hence revenue) primarily derived from ZeroAccess. While it proves highly challenging to extrapolate from our direct observations to a truly global view, by anchoring our analysis in the data for these ad units we estimate that the botnet's fraudulent activities plausibly induced advertising losses on the order of $100,000 per day.
The current landscape of the core Internet technologies shows considerable centralisation with the big tech companies controlling the vast majority of traffic and services. This situation has sparked a wide range of decentralisation initiatives with blockchain technology being among the most prominent and successful innovations. At the same time, over the past years there have been considerable attempts to address the security and privacy issues affecting the Domain Name System (DNS). To this end, it is claimed that Blockchain-based DNS may solve many of the limitations of traditional DNS. However, such an alternative comes with its own security concerns and issues, as any introduction and adoption of a new technology typically does - let alone a disruptive one. In this work we present the emerging threat landscape of blockchain-based DNS and we empirically validate the threats with real-world data. Specifically, we explore a part of the blockchain DNS ecosystem in terms of the browser extensions using such technologies, the chain itself (Namecoin and Emercoin), the domains, and users who have been registered in these platforms. Our findings reveal several potential domain extortion attempts and possible phishing schemes. Finally, we suggest countermeasures to address the identified threats, and we identify emerging research themes.
In the era of digital economy and high penetration rate of technology, cybercrime is taking over a great span of the cyberworld. Novice to experienced users are subject to being victims to cyber criminals. Phishing attempts lead to critical issues and risks for online users, and for companies as well. This research proposes a framework for fraud prevention by enabling the automatic detection of malicious websites. The applicability of the framework is validated by various types of experiments. The experiments tries to model phishing websites using various algorithms and approaches, including hybrid approaches. It is apparent that the performance of Random Forest Trees algorithm overperformed several other algorithms. Accordingly, the framework is proved to be useful in the segregation of malicious online content and phishing attempts. In addition the results call for more investigation and improvement in fraud prevention approaches.
Rapid growth in technological criminal activities has drawn worldwide attention to cyber forensics. The objective of a cyber forensics is to provide situation awareness in terms of identification and preservation of digital evidence, extraction of information, and analysis of extracted information to facilitate time-critical decision making. However, Cyber Forensic Investigations (CFIs) still lack significant structure to provide reliable insight into major cyberattack patterns. Data from the Global Cyber Security Index (GCI) show that Pakistan lags far behind in technological and organizational initiatives, posing a threat to its national security. This article focuses on state coordinated CFI infrastructure to mitigate the occurrence of cybercrime challenges. Moreover, a conceptual model is established to address the infrastructure of CFI using policy approach, legal, technical, organizational, capacity building, and cooperative venture. This conceptual model is structured in pillars to simplify the CFI infrastructure. The goal of the study is to provide an empirical foundation for policymakers to develop a comprehensive framework for CFI in the country, and to offer insights and recommendations for improving the infrastructure to better combat cybercrime in Pakistan.
Cybercriminals exploit opportunities for anonymity and masquerade in web-based communication to conduct illegal activities such as phishing, spamming, cyber predation, cyber threatening, blackmail, and drug trafficking. One way to fight cybercrime is to collect digital evidence from online documents and to prosecute cybercriminals in the court of law. In this paper, we propose a unified framework using data mining and natural language processing techniques to analyze online messages for the purpose of crime investigation. Our framework takes the chat log from a confiscated computer as input, extracts the social networks from the log, summarizes chat conversations into topics, identifies the information relevant to crime investigation, and visualizes the knowledge for an investigator. To ensure that the implemented framework meets the needs of law enforcement officers in real-life investigation, we closely collaborate with the cybercrime unit of a law enforcement agency in Canada. Both the feedback from the law enforcement officers and experimental results suggest that the proposed chat log mining framework is effective for crime investigation.
The European Union's Internal Security Fund (ISF) will contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the Union, by supporting actions that help to prevent and combat terrorism and radicalisation, serious and organised crime, and cybercrime. One such project that has launched in January 2022 is Anti-FinTer: Versatile artificial intelligence investigative technologies for revealing online cross-border financing activities of terrorism.
Online markets in cryptocurrency represent a sprawling and eclectic alternative financial system, selling cutting edge techno-investment schemes that are complex and high risk. Crime control is almost entirely absent from this new crypto economy, and it is full of scams. This paper draws on an ethnography of crypto trading to review the main types of scam, suggesting that the grey economy of cryptocurrency trading is part of a wider evolution of society towards the technosocial, and beyond that perhaps towards the metaversal.
With the advancement of information technology, criminals employ multiple cyberspaces to promote cybercrime. To combat cybercrime and cyber dangers, banks and financial institutions use artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies assist the banking sector to develop and grow in many ways. Transparency and explanation of AI's ability are required to preserve trust. Deep learning protects client behavior and interest data. Deep learning techniques may anticipate cyber-attack behavior, allowing for secure banking transactions. This proposed approach is based on a user-centric design that safeguards people's private data over banking. Here, initially, the attack data can be generated over banking transactions. Routing is done for the configuration of the nodes. Then, the obtained data can be preprocessed for removing the errors. Followed by hierarchical network feature extraction can be used to identify the abnormal features related to the attack. Finally, the user data can be protected and the malicious attack in the transmission route can be identified by using the Wrapper stepwise ResNet classifier. The proposed work outperforms other techniques in terms of attack detection and accuracy, and the findings are depicted in the graphical format by employing the Python tool.
Social media is a technology that can be developed in a fast and flexible manner, where internet connections are transformed into interactive platforms. Social networking programs are increasingly spreading around the world. Facebook users reached 1.44 billion per month in 2015, which means that most of the people of the world have a stamp on social networking platforms. Social media platforms have become integral part of teens'daily life. 22% of teenagers are enrolled in social networking programs about 10 times a day. The remaining category, which makes up more than half of teenagers register more than once a day through the use of mobile phone, where the proportion of teenagers who have their own cell phones reach 75%. The results show by RSA that the rate of cybercrime reached 173% by mobile phones during the period 2013-2015. And, the RSA announce a large number of real examples of cybercrime that have occurred recently and continue to pose a major threat to society and specific to teenagers. Consequently, this paper review social media, society and business. Moreover, how he social media impact teenagers.
As the variety of new social media applications are developed at an ever-increasing rate, the number of related potential vulnerabilities and related attack vectors are also increasing. Traditionally, social engineering attacks have always been a major cause of concern for Information Security departments. However, the theft, abuse and manipulation of personal information for malicious purposes has become even prolific since the mass adoption of social media and gaming applications by the average person, largely fueled by the boom in social media and gaming applications. These newly introduced and ever-evolving apps continue to introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor system design and coding practices and have led to a multitude of sophisticated attacks and digital crimes. Attacks such as, Malware infections, ransomware, Session Hijacking, SQL Injection, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks have been facilitated in part by the race to developing social media platforms, and applications. Hence, more effective countermeasures and prevention techniques are introduced to detect and minimize the resulting damage and losses associated with this trend. This paper presents a novel 'credentials crawling' proof of concept exploit to illustrate the ease with which such attacks can be launched. The proof of concept is implemented via a stealthy application, which has been implemented (in part) using a commercial of-the-shelf application (Camera Mouse 2011). The newly developed stealth robot uses stealth techniques to conceal itself from the intended target/victim. The proposed approach enables the developed robot application to remain undetected by leading commercial anti-virus solutions. The developed robot has been tested in different environments, with various operating systems protected by various commercial antivirus solutions. The presented approach was tested on computers belonging to people from different walks of life including graduate and undergraduate students, faculty and staff (with their consent). The initial test result demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective as a tool to assist with promoting awareness against a variety of user-focused cyber-attacks especially phishing attacks.
The forgery and fraudulent behaviour associated with examination results and academic certificates at the different stages from storing, publishing, transfer to verification, remain a major cybercrime issue within the educational sector. In this paper, the authors discuss the technological dimension underpinning such issues and propose a system consisting of digital ID verification structures, which ensure and confirm individual access via decentralized storage like Blockchain systems, in order to minimise fraudulent activities. Based on extensive desk research and a case study (using a demonstrator) which was presented and discussed with a focus group, comprising of stakeholders with a good understanding on the topic of Blockchain technologies and digital IDs, the authors discuss how the publication, storage and transfer of educational and academic achievements may potentially be transformed due to the adoption of Blockchain technologies, especially through digital ID verification. In particular, the authors identify issues pertaining to the setting up of the chain of trust, recognition of digital IDs, non-technical expertise, costs, human interventions and cybersecurity as crucial for the successful consideration and implementation of Blockchain-based digital IDs and as areas for future work in counteracting cybercrime with regard to assessment results and credentials in the educational sector.
"Experiencing negative outcomes online is increasingly common, with more people active online and the continued presence of aggressive online behaviours. This study sought to uncover the underlying factor structure of negative online consequences. It investigated how experiencing negative outcomes is associated with engaging in specific online activities. Australian adult Internet users (N=1773, mean age=42.5years, 54.8% female) completed an online survey. An underlying factor structure was identified with subgroups of negative outcomes identified relating to hacking/identity theft, abuse/harassment, non-targeted scams and targeted scams. Victimisation was associated with engagement with online pornography and forums; use of multiple discussion forums, dating, and gaming sites; and expenditure on gaming, dating and pornography sites. Results suggest that overall Internet involvement does not predict victimisation, but specific activities are linked to certain harms. This research creates a framework to inform policy and practice to minimise online victimisation and guide ongoing research."
Transactions on the darknet are notoriously difficult to examine. Prior criminological research has generally used web scraping and qualitative text analysis to examine illegal darknet markets. One disadvantage of this process is that individuals can lie. Fortunately for researchers, the currency used for transactions on the darknet, cryptocurrency, is designed to be tracked. In this article, we examine transactions from a former darknet marketplace, AlphaBay. Using the blockchain, we examine the interconnectedness of both legal and illegal cryptocurrencies. In addition, we provide a structured approach to quantitatively examine the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, offering both the tools and our own experiences for other researchers interested in such approaches. While cybersecurity, information technology, accounting, and other disciplines can examine the financial data itself, we believe that criminologists can provide additional benefits in pattern analysis and organizing the context and theory around the transactions. Our results show that cryptocurrency transactions are generally identifiable (90%) and involve likely illegal transactions, transactions that attempt to obfuscate other transactions, and legal transactions. We end with a discussion of newer cryptocurrencies and related technology and how they will likely shape future work.
In this work we present a methodology to improve Informatics Security in different kind of organizations. The organization could be a government agency, a corporation or social organizations. The methodology is focused to convince, involve and compromise managers and directors to implant actions for Informatics Security then involve all the organization in that tasks. The methodology has been successful in manufacturer and service companies..
"Technology affects almost every aspect of life and is constantly changing. Digital communication technology has made it easier and faster to connect people all over the world. Digital technology is used in varies fields, including business, industries, companies, and educational institutions. There are various benefits of technology; it is also associated with a number of risks and dangerous threats known as cybercrimes. Cybercrime is a criminal activity that targets digital technology, like a computer, a computer network, or a mobile device. Cybersecurity is the way we reduce the risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime. Cybersecurity is the process of defending against cyberattacks. By using these concepts, we investigated the interval-valued complex T-spherical fuzzy relations (IVCT-spherical-FRs) introduced in this paper. We studied the relationships between different types of cybersecurity and the sources of cyberattacks. Furthermore, the Hasse diagram for the interval-valued complex T-spherical partial order set and relation is developed. The concepts of Hasse diagram are being used to examine various cybersecurity techniques and practices. The most effective method is identified using the features of Hasse diagrams. Finally, comparison tests are used to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methods."
Underground forums are discussion outlets where criminal communities exchange knowledge about online malicious activities and trade illegal goods and services that promote an underground economy based on malicious software, stolen personal information, tools for financial fraud, drugs and more. Prior work has investigated the interactions between criminals and the type of assets traded in Surface Web forums. At the same time, research evidence suggests cybercriminals are moving their operations to the Dark Web to avoid getting caught and similar research has been carried out in Dark Web forums from different perspectives. However, there is no empirical evidence on how forum criminal activity related to the underground economy takes place in both Web environments. To address this problem, we conduct a quantitative exploratory analysis about the trading activity taking place in four prominent forums in the Surface Web and four in the Dark Web based on the type of posts found in the forums. Then, we compare the data to find differences in the malicious activity observed. Our results show that trading activity is higher in Dark Web forums compared to the Surface Web. We also find that different types of transactions, products and prices vary according to the Web environment.
Providing security for interacting cloud services requires more than user authentication with passwords or digital certificates and confidentiality in data transmission. Existing data protection mechanisms have previously failed in preventing data theft attacks perpetrated by an insider to the cloud provider or impersonators. In this paper, we focus on the service cloud model, which facilitates the composition and communication among web services owned by different cloud vendors. We augment a detection approach for impersonation attacks with additional analyses to improve the security of communicating web services hosted in the cloud. A statistical model generates a normal behavior profile for individual services and groups of services based on their business tasks. The detection approach monitors the behavior of each service and identifies anomalies as a potential impersonation attack if it deviates significantly from the expected behavior. To verify the impersonation attack, we deploy a cloud-based verification technique, misleading suspicious services with useless responses. The experimental results show that modeling request behavior reliably detects a significant number of impersonation attempts, with a performance degradation that is a reasonable trade-off.
Building upon Eck and Clarke's (2003) ideas for explaining crimes in which there is no face-to-face contact between victims and offenders, the authors developed an adapted lifestyle-routine activities theory. Traditional conceptions of place-based environments depend on the convergence of victims and offenders in time and physical space to explain opportunities for victimization. With their proposed cyberlifestyle-routine activities theory, the authors moved beyond this conceptualization to explain opportunities for victimization in cyberspace environments where traditional conceptions of time and space are less relevant. Cyberlifestyle-routine activities theory was tested using a sample of 974 college students on a particular type of cybervictimization-cyberstalking. The study's findings provide support for the adapted theoretical perspective. Specifically, variables measuring online exposure to risk, online proximity to motivated offenders, online guardianship, online target attractiveness, and online deviance were significant predictors of cyberstalking victimization. Implications for advancing cyberlifestyle-routine activities theory are discussed.
The objective of this chapter is to set the scene for the remainder of the book. The core of this book seeks to address both the theory of crime and the question of forensic psychology's contribution to the understanding of cybercrime. Specific examples of online crime such as hacking, malware, identity theft, child pornography and cyberbullying are dealt with in some detail in later chapters. Before exploring these subjects it is necessary to set out some context. The first section of this chapter seeks to define the nature of online crime or cybercrime and look at the ways in which society is responding to it. The nature of the response is multi-faceted. Governments attempt to respond with law, corporations with policies and procedures, suppliers with terms and conditions, users with peer pressure, technologists with code. The second section looks at how international laws have evolved through what are referred to as 'soft law' and seeks to draw lessons for the evolution of laws for the internet. The final section looks at the more general area of governance and also looks at how ideas of governance have evolved and how some of the theoretical work in this field may offer guidance for the governance of the internet.
Airline tickets that have been obtained illicitly represent a truly global crime. The travel industry and law enforcement have been attempting to address travel fraud for some time. Airline tickets can be obtained using various cybercrime methods. They are traded and advertised on online blackmarkets and through fraudulent travel agencies. This research is qualitative in nature, informed by interviews with law enforcement and industry stakeholders, as well as the analysis of a marketplace where fraudulently obtained tickets are traded. This research considers: the nature of the criminal market for fraudulently obtained tickets, the involvement of co-offending and organized crime, the geographic nature of travel fraud, and the ways in which those supplying fraudulently obtained tickets try to avoid detection. Also considered is how the nature of travel fraud has changed over time, ways in which it may continue to change, and the challenges faced by law enforcement.
Concern over juvenile sexting behaviors has increased substantially over the last decade, leading to criminological inquiries of the correlates of sexting. Evidence suggests that sexting behavior is associated with one's level of self-control, such that individuals with low self-control are unable to constrain themselves from acting on opportunities to offend. Though self-control is correlated with sexting, few have considered the ways that situational opportunities associated with technology access and self-control influence one another. This study attempted to address this gap in the literature through an analysis of 1328 adolescents enrolled in secondary schools located in a large metropolitan region of South Australia. The findings from three binary logistic regression models illustrated that low self-control, and online opportunity factors were associated with sexting behaviors, though self-control was mediated by the inclusion of opportunity measures. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of criminological theory is discussed in detail.
Android-based Smartphone is getting more popular year by year. The increasing number of Android smart phone users also give effect to the development and the use of mobile instant messenger application. One of the instant messenger application that is widely used is Blackberry Messenger (BBM). The rapid increasing number of BBM users may cause positive and negative effects. The example of positive effect is communication becomes easier, and the example of negative effect is there are some persons that using BBM to perform digital crimes such as pornography and frauds. If BBM was installed on that smartphone, then digital evidences can be acquired and expected to become an option to assist law enforcements in uncovering digital crimes. The method used in this research is mobile forensic method which is based on available guidelines prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The results of the research are presented in the form of recorded conversations, BBM Personal Identification Number (BBM PIN), and conversation timestamp.
Web browsers that run on a computer often keep sensitive information such as user credentials and saving account numbers. With modern technology, all Web applications including web browsers apply password logins as a fundamental authentication to prove a user's identity. Passwords act as the first line of defense against attacker exploitation. However, some web browsers tend to save user passwords in databases as plaintext. This issue enables attackers to readily obtain user credentials and use the acquired passwords to break in high security web pages. This paper proposes a method that uses password hashing to secure user credentials whenever they log onto a web browser. In particular, the purpose of this method is to secure user credentials against identity theft. This method protects user credentials using passphrase password hashing using a concatenation of three elements, password, user defined passphrase, and webpage domain name. A respective string concatenation is hashed and sent to the web browser server for storage. The proposed method is easy to be developed and deployed in the web browser.
Due to the Internet's quick spread and the digitalisation of commercial activity, cybercrime has risen dramatically. Computers or data are the intended victim of cybercrime.This paper is about Cyber Complaint Automation System. The current cyber cell of Kerala police has a time comsuming approach.Complaint can be given in two ways. A written complaint can be given to cyber police station. Second option is to use cyber crime reporting portal. In this portal user has to undergo four different steps to sucessfully register the complaint. These complaints are stored in a database and manually classified into respective departments. This methodology of a cyber complaint takes a great deal of effort and time. The time wasted on current system helps the criminal in covering his track. As a result, the victim's time and money are squandered, and police receive criticism. We are working to create a software that will drastically shorten the time it takes to handle a complaint in an effort to remedy this scenario. Our system automates the classification process and prioritize emergency complaints.Thus helps the police to apprehend the criminal faster.
This article aims to investigate financial and non-financial implications of cybercrimes in emerging countries. In a globalized world, is very difficult to quantify in a precise manner the economic impact of cybercrimes. Nevertheless, there are significant differences among financial and non-financial implications of cybercrime attacks. Despite widespread awareness, the vulnerability of emerging countries regarding cybersecurity surveys is still very high. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
In this article, we study the various functions of online cybercriminal meeting places from a unique perspective: We do not take the criminal meeting place as a starting point, but the users-the criminal networks. This allows not only for a view of what is happening on online meeting places, but it also places online meeting places into perspective. Our data consisted of detailed case descriptions of 40 cybercriminal networks active in the Netherlands (18), Germany (3), the United Kingdom (9), and the United States (10). Reconstructions were made based on analysis of police files and/or interviews with case officers and public prosecutors. Online meeting places play a role in the majority of our cases: to meet co-offenders, to buy tools, or to sell data. However, from a crime script perspective, the role of forums is much more modest. Forums, for example, can be used to find suitable co-offenders, but in the majority of our cases the core members did not meet at forums. Offline meeting places still play an important role in cybercriminal networks. Furthermore, forums can be viewed as online versions of offline offender convergence settings-physical locations such as a bar-where criminals can meet, and ensure continuity and structure. However, forums might be more accessible than physical criminal meeting places. For a curious newbie, it is, for example, easier to visit all sorts of forums than it is to visit all sorts of criminal bars. Finally, our cases show that the learning function of forums should not be underestimated.
Data wiping is used to securely delete securely unwanted files. However, the misuse of data wiping can destroy pieces of evidence to be spoiled in a digital forensic investigation. To cope with the misuse of data wiping, we proposed an anti-anti-forensic method based on NTFS transaction features and a machine leaming algorithm. This method allows investigators to obtain information regarding 'which files are wiped' and 'which data wiping tools and data sanitization standards used'. In this study, we achieved good identification of data wiping traces in the NTFS file system. Leveraging the efficiency of machine leaming mod els, our method effectively recognizes wiped partitions and files in the NTFS file system and identifies tools used in data sanitization.

This paper explores the characteristics of repeat victimisation (RV) in relation to fraud and computer misuse (F&CM) crimes recorded in Wales, United Kingdom (UK). The wider study included mixed-methods analysis of a sample of cases (n = 10,001) reported by individuals in Wales, over a period of two years (ending in September 2016). In this paper, key results from the quantitative part of this study concerning RV are presented. This paper contributes to an empirically grounded understanding RV with respect to F&CM and its insights are of direct relevance to theoretical understandings of victimisation and the formulation of interventions within the 'Protect' strand of policing in the UK. It suggests that older age is associated with RV for these crime types, that a repeat report is likely to be of the same general type as the crime which preceded it and that interventions to protect individuals from being re-victimised are best targeted within two weeks to one month of the first report. The paper also highlights the extent to which RV analysis is constrained by the rules which shape crime recording and identifies avenues for improvement of data collection and further research. Furthermore, it suggests the need to develop a framework of F&CM vulnerability which goes beyond risk of re-victimisation and better accounts for and enables a response to victims' wider support needs.
"Cybercrime caused by exploited vulnerabilities bears a huge burden on societies. Most of these vulnerabilities are detectable, and the damage is preventable if software vendors and firms that deploy such software adopt right practices. Bug Bounty Programs (BBPs) by vendors and intermediaries are one of the most important creations in recent years, that helps software vendors to create marketplaces and to detect and prevent such exploits. This article develops the theory of BBPs and present a typology of BBPs using established theories of incentive compatibility and mechanism design. The authors empirically analyze the market creation function of BBPs using granular data from two different types of BBPs on a popular intermediary platform. The research findings suggest that BBPs are valuable opportunities to source vulnerabilities in software; nevertheless, the rate of disclosure and hacker participation marginally increases with vendor's rewards and other incentives. Similarly, the results show that security researchers are motivated to contribute to BBPs that offer higher remuneration and not just those programs with a higher likelihood for bug discovery. Our findings will help researchers and practitioners in information security and allied domains to develop a theoretical and empirical perspective of BBPs, and their usefulness to curb incidents of cybercrime."
The present study resolved the challenges of implementing maneuvers through dynamic simulation of the cyber battlefield. The battlefield provided had the essential information for detecting cybercrime events. Cyber battlefield contains detailed information on cyberspace elements, including the vulnerability knowledge repository, the tangible and intangible components of the cyberspace, and the relationships between them allowing maneuvering, penetration testing, injection attacks, tracking attacks, visualization, evaluating the impact of cyber-attacks and risk evaluation.
Ransomware groups represent a significant cyber threat to Western states. Most high-end ransomware actors reside in territorial safe-haven jurisdictions and prove to be resistant to traditional law enforcement activities. This has prompted public sector and cybersecurity industry leaders to perceive ransomware as a national security threat requiring a whole-of-government approach, including cyber operations. In this paper, we investigate whether cyber operations or the threat of cyber operations influence the ransomware ecosystem. Subsequently, we assess the vectors of influence and characteristics of past operations that have disrupted the ecosystem. We describe the specifics of the ransomware-as-a-service system and provide three case studies (DarkSide/BlackMatter, REvil, Conti) highly representative of the current ecosystem and the effect cyber operations have on it. Additionally, we present initial observations about the influence of cyber operations on the system, including best practices from cyber operations against non-state groups. We conclude that even professional, highly skilled, and top-performing ransomware groups can be disrupted through cyber operations. In fact, cyber operations can even bypass some limits imposed on law enforcement operations. Even when ransomware groups rebrand or resurface after a hiatus, we suggest their infrastructure (both technical, human, and reputational) will still suffer mid- to long-term disruption. Although cyber operations arc unlikely to be a silver bullet, they are an essential tool in the whole-of-government and multinational efforts and may even grow in importance in the next several years.
Cyber criminals are utilizing diverse approaches to draw money from internet users and organizations. Recently, a malware called ransomware has become effectively accessible for this job due to its ease of availability and distribution methods. Security experts are working to counter ransomware attacks by fixing the vulnerabilities of operating system. In this research work, we have proposed a method to prevent the ransomware attack at its early stages through its delivery channels like Exploit Kits. We have analyzed the crawling patterns (listing of file path, dropped file, network activity, ransom note etc.) of victim's computer. These patterns have been used to extract the features for classification of malicious samples. We have used supervised machine learning algorithms for classification of malwares. Experimental results shows that accuracy of 94% is achieved in tightly bound mode by using random forest algorithm. While, accuracy of 91% is achieved in moderate bound mode by using random forest classification algorithm.
The occurrence of criminal activities has increased owing to the advent of internet or computer technology. Access to internet has posed serious challenges to the existing legal regime and enforcement paradigm. The recent experience concerning rate of technology and online communication has no doubt fashioned-out a dramatic increase in the incidence of criminal activities. It has also resulted in the occurrence of what is considered as a new approach of criminal activities. Although, the emergence of electronic communication advances economic prosperity of the world's commerce, fraudsters have gained access and seen the medium as a fertile ground for pretence. This paper firstly discusses the wide-ranging descriptions that led to the complex concept of cybercrime. The paper then examines the importance of cybercrimes regulations to curb infidelity in the use of computer technology. It also investigates the interface between cybercrimes and human rights and argued that human rights are an onerous matter that should be given proper consideration when dealing with cybercrime offenders. The paper utilizes legal research method by way of examining the Nigerian Cybercrimes Act 2015 and its relationship with several human rights provisions. It concludes by revealing the need to prevent cybercrimes that coincide with the right of an individual to enjoy his right to privacy and at the same time ensuring cyber security.
Darknet markets have been used increasingly for the transaction of drugs in the last decade. The growth of illicit drug transactions on darknet markets has led enforcement agencies to invest a greater proportion of time and effort to monitor and crack down on criminal activities on darknet websites. Whereas large-scale site-shutdown efforts involving policing agencies across various countries can help in slowing down the growth of these markets, such enforcement strategies may not be sustainable in the long run given the cost and time they require to coordinate. Thus, there is a need for alternative, costefficient strategies to police darknet markets on a regular basis. In response, this study attempts to empirically evaluate and quantify the effectiveness of selectively targeting large drug vendors on darknet sites. Using data from the three largest darknet markets, we employ a difference-in-differences procedure to assess the impact of the arrest of a major drug dealer on subsequent darknet activities. Specifically, we contrast various outcomes from the policed site (Silk Road 2) with those from nonpoliced sites (Agora and Evolution) and find that enforcement efforts on the policed site reduced subsequent transaction levels and the number of remaining vendors. The enforcement was not only effective in deterring users in the same country as the arrestees, but also had a spillover effect on darknet participants who were beyond the prosecutorial jurisdictions of the arrestees. Test results on heterogeneous effects further suggest that small darknet drug vendors were most deterred by the arrest event and drug vendors selling dangerous drugs were more deterred relative to those selling less dangerous drugs. Our findings have policy and theoretical implications for law makers, enforcement agencies, and academics.
Amidst renewed concern about the prevalence of online child sexual abuse material, the global technology sector is refocusing on models of multistakeholder governance and the development of new technological solutions. This paper argues that the language of multistakeholderism and technological solutionism obscures the administrative and commercial practices that facilitate the widespread distribution of abuse material. To illustrate this point, the paper describes the 2019 intervention of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in the operations of Trichan, three websites that were amongst the largest purveyors of abuse material on the open web for 7 years. The case study underscores the materiality of the Internet and the role of commercial relations within the infrastructure stack in the provision of illegal content. While identifying opportunities for the mass removal of abuse material, the paper questions the discretion granted to technology companies under laissez faire regulation, and troubles characterizations of Internet infrastructure as neutral and instrumental factors in the epidemic availability of abuse material.
The development of ICT and the ever-increasing role of the Internet in the functioning of virtually all contemporary organisations has increased the number of threats related to security of information and data. The low level of measures protecting organisational information resources and a growing number of incidents of personal data breaches prompted the European Union to introduce a new regulation that imposes stricter rules in the area of information and personal data protection in its member states. The new EU's legislation - General Data Protection Regulation, commonly called the GDPR, became effective on 25th May 2018. This paper presents the selected issues related to information and personal data management in a selected group of Polish public service bodies. Based on the results of the conducted surveys, the authors present in it the assessment of the state of personal data security in these organisations just prior to the introduction of the GDPR.
"The BitTorrent Sync client application is the most progressive development in the BitTorrent family. Nevertheless, it can be used for the activities that draw the attention of the forensics invetigators. The BitTorrent Sync client application employs quite largely the encryption for sending data packages. The initiation of the activity is carried out in the plain text only. Therefore, we proposed the methodology that enables to capture the initiation step and to inform the forensics investigator, which then takes the reactive actions. The experiment was carried in two modes: 1) simulating of the use of the BitTorrent Sync application; 2) monitoring of real traffic on the Internet. During the monitoring, it is possible to calculate the public lookup SHA1 hash of the shared file. The comparison of the calculated hash with the list of publicly available hashes allows determination whether sharing of the file is legal or illegal. The presented methodology can be applied to any BitTorrent protocol."
There has been a rapid growth in the number of cybercrimes that cause tremendous financial loss to organizations. Recent studies reveal that cybercriminals tend to collaborate or even transact cyber-attack tools via the dark markets established in online social media. Accordingly, it presents unprecedented opportunities for researchers to tap into these underground cybercriminal communities to develop better insights about collaborative cybercrime activities so as to combat the ever increasing number of cybercrimes. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel weakly supervised cybercriminal network mining method to facilitate cybercrime forensics. In particular, the proposed method is underpinned by a probabilistic generative model enhanced by a novel context-sensitive Gibbs sampling algorithm. Evaluated based on two social media corpora, our experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based method and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method by 5.23% and 16.62% in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), respectively. It also achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful research of applying a probabilistic generative model to mine cybercriminal networks from online social media.
This autobiographical review is about a research life unusually oriented to the long-term study of organizational crime, peace, and crisis prevention. Most ambitions proved half-baked. Hopes for a more sweeping macrocriminology of freedom will doubtless remain half-baked when cooking ceases. None of the author's mentors bear responsibility for the mess left in the kitchen from attempts to understand how to grow freedom and prevent crime and war. Messy kitchens must sometimes become even messier before they create the best kind of challenge for the tidier minds that clean them up.
Distribution of nude, intimate and sexualized images individuals consent and against the wishes of those individuals whose image has been captured, is of growing concern across the world. Moving from the conceptualization of 'revenge porn' in the early 2000' s, through to our more sophisticated understanding of the issues of image-based abuse and non-consensual pornography this paper considers the broad context of these crimes. The paper draws on the concepts of online misogyny, gender-based victimization, and toxic masculinity. The progress towards criminalization of such online abuse, with reference to the recent introduction of new laws in England &Wales and Australia is examined. This shift from voluntary to statutory regulation, and from civil to criminal law remedies has been coupled with new crime prevention and control initiatives that seek to encourage reporting leading to prosecution and educate users and empower victims. As countries successively tackle image-based abuse through their own criminal justice systems and stakeholder engagement, there is a need to learn from and critique what has already been established. Summarizing the approaches undertaken in England & Wales and Australia we draw important conclusions that are based on the experiences of early responders, bringing together several best practices for the prevention and response to image-based abuse.
Nowadays, cyber-love scam cases in Malaysia are increasing along with cutting-edge technological advances. Therefore, this paper employs quantitative research methodology to explore the factors that influence the susceptibility to cyber-love scam victimization in Malaysia among individuals who have been victims of cyber-love scams and lodged the police reports in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. Based on Routine Activity Theory, this study investigates the relationship between demographic variables such as age, education level, marital status, monthly income and independent variables such as level of computer skills and the level of cyber fraud awareness. The findings of this study are useful for policy makers and enforcement agencies to protect the Internet users in Malaysia.
The recent cybercrimes growth is a serious issue, millions of people become the victim of cybercrime and most of them cannot be prevented easily just by strong passwords. The attacks include key logging, brute-forcing, guessing attacks, replay attack. In this paper, we will discuss an authentication scheme in which using an android phone we can tackle any such attacks and provide a secure authentication over insecure and low-security networks.
Firms spend enormous resources on digital advertising and promoting their brand online. In the meantime, ad fraud undertaken by cybercriminals cost $42 billion in 2019 and could reach $100 billion by 2023. However, while digital advertisers continue to wrestle with how to effectively counteract ad-fraud, the topic of advertising fraud itself has received little academic attention. Here, we investigate this gap between practice and research through an exploration of ad-fraud communities. Our research implemented a multimethod approach for data collection in a longitudinal (18 months, October 2017 to April 2019) online investigation of this phenomenon. Integrating qualitative and quantitative analysis, we examined (1) internal interactions within ad-fraud communities and (2) ad-fraud communities' performance and growth. Our online investigation extends our conceptual understanding of ad-fraud and explains how ad-fraud communities innovate. Our findings indicate that capabilities enacted by some communities foster requisite variety and enable the coordination of complex, iterative, and incremental dynamics (cocreation of artificial intelligence-based bots, customer involvement, and reinforcing capabilities). This research has both theoretical and practical implications for innovation in cybercriminal communities. Furthermore, we provide practical guidance for policy-makers and advertisers regarding how to improve their response to business threats. Indeed, a better understanding of how ad-fraud communities innovate enables organizations to develop countermeasures and intelligence capabilities.
Copyright industries represent an important part of the developed economies. The effective protection of copyright fulfills an important role in the advancement of innovation and economic development. However, in the digital economy, the protection of copyrighted works poses numerous and very difficult challenges. The protected works usually targeted by criminals are computer programs, motion pictures, video games, and musical compositions. The estimated or actual harm to copyright owners can amount to billions of dollars. Moreover, these offenses are sometimes perpetrated in connection with other crimes, such as conspiracy to commit racketeering or money laundering. This paper argues that criminal enforcement of copyright can be an important safeguard of economic and information security interests. The paper discusses essential aspects regarding the criminal protection of copyright in the United States. Based on a theoretically-informed, yet empirically-driven approach, which takes into account a large corpus of data, consisting mostly of cases brought to courts of law, the paper discusses the main aspects of the phenomenon. Finally, the paper proposes a number of measures that would improve the protection copyrighted works.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of exposure to motivated offenders who may alter the vulnerability levels to phishing victimization. This is particularly focused on explaining the influences of individuals' online lifestyles and attitudes toward information sharing online on phishing susceptibility. Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper explores the risk of phishing victimization using criminological theories. The authors draw on empirical evidence from existing cybercrime literature and revisit routine activities theory (RAT) and lifestyle RAT (LRAT) to elucidate the risk of phishing victimization. This paper proposes that cyber-RAT, which was developed from RAT and LRAT, could interpret phishing victimization. Grounded on the intervention-based theory against cybercrime phishing, this study suggests that an attitude toward precautionary behavior (information sharing online) is essential to mitigate the phishing victimization risk. Findings This paper aims to provide a clear insight into the understanding of phishing victimization risk using theoretical and empirical evidence. Originality/value The theoretical perspective outlined provides the understanding of the impacts of online routine activities on a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of phishing threats. The important role of the precautionary countermeasure, that is, attitudes toward information sharing online is highlighted to reconcile the phishing victimization risk.
Risks from cybercrime and terrorists are in the news every day. What is not so well broadcast, however, are the risks that exist to operators from climate change. Here, Emma Fryer explores digital infrastructure in the context of climate change risks, aiming to present some indicators of the general state of readiness, to identify areas where greater scrutiny is needed and to stimulate discussion on how these risks should be managed looking ahead.
Ransomware incidents have increased dramatically in the past few years. The number of ransomware variants is also increasing, which means signature and heuristic-based detection techniques are becoming harder to achieve, due to the ever changing pattern of ransomware attack vectors. Therefore, in order to combat ransomware, we need a better understanding on how ransomware is being deployed, its characteristics, as well as how potential victims may react to ransomware incidents. This paper aims to address this challenge by carrying out an investigation on 18 families of ransomware, leading to a model for categorising ransomware behavioural characteristics, which can then be used to improve detection and handling of ransomware incidents. The categorisation was done in respect to the stages of ransomware deployment methods with a predictive model we developed called Randep. The stages are fingerprint, propagate, communicate, map, encrypt, lock, delete and threaten. Analysing the samples gathered for the predictive model provided an insight into the stages and timeline of ransomware execution. Furthermore, we carried out a study on how potential victims (individuals, as well as IT support staff at universities and SMEs) detect that ransomware was being deployed on their machine, what steps they took to investigate the incident, and how they responded to the attack. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The results shed an interesting light into the most common attack methods, the most targeted operating systems and the infection symptoms, as well as recommended defence mechanisms. This information can be used in the future to create behavioural patterns for improved ransomware detection and response.
social media like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn has gotten to be a portion of our lives. Cybercrime has ended up an imperative issue, particularly in creating nations. The spread of data with no hazard of being identified and brought leads to an increment in cybercriminals. In the meantime, the huge of information constantly generated from Twitter has made the method of detecting cybercriminals a troublesome task. This paper analyzes how content size such as tweets on Twitter, posts on Facebook, etc. on other social media played in the predict cybercrime. So, in this paper, we try to answer, What are the fit content sizes that have more effects on accuracy?. This paper presents a solution based on two techniques: Dominant Meaning DM, and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency TF-IDF. This solution constructs super comparable vectors for both pockets negative and positive from different contents that have the same size. These vector plays a vital role to predict pocket for input tweets. To overcome this challenge, we compared the performance of the two mentioned methods. Our results introduced recommendations sizes of content that answered the question of research. However, the recommendation sizes may be disturbed by changes in the technique that generate super comparable vectors. The range of improvement which comes from dominant meaning for precision, recall, and F1 values is 75%, 75%, 70.07% respectively.
"Background: The strong demand for health data by cybercrime exposes hospital structures in particular to IT risks. The greater connectivity to existing IT networks has in fact exposed Administrations to new IT security vulnerabilities, as healthcare is an extremely interesting target for cybercrime for two fundamental reasons: on the one hand, it is a source rich in valuable data and on the other, very often, the defenses are weak. Methods: The general purpose of the study was to investigate the cybersecurity in cardiology, a strategic field of the health care. The specific purpose of the study was: (I) to perform a first overview in this field; and (II) to investigate the opinion on the cyber-risk in cardiology directly interviewing the actors working in this field, using a properly designed questionnaire submitted using mobile technology. Results: Fifty seven cardiologists participated in the study and filled the proposed questionnaire on their smartphone/tablet. From a global point of view the output of this work allowed to highlight some important issues related to the perception of the cybersecurity specifically on the actors working in the field of the cardiology as for example their opinion on the received and/or needed training. Conclusions: A properly designed questionnaire has been: (I) proposed to investigate the perception of the cybersecurity among subjects working in cardiology; (II) successfully submitted to 57 cardiologists highlighting some critically important issues."
"As a typical cybercrime, cyber fraud poses severe threats to civilians' property safety and social stability. Traditional criminological theories such as routine activity theory focus mainly on the effects of individual characteristics on cybercrime victimization and ignore the impacts of macro-level environmental factors. This study aims at exploring the spatiotemporal pattern of cyber fraud crime in China and investigating the relationships between cyber fraud and environmental factors. The results showed that cyber fraud crimes were initially distributed in southeastern China and gradually spread towards the middle and northern regions; spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that the spatial concentration trend of cyber fraud became more and more strong, and a strong distinction in cyber fraud clustering between the north and the south was identified. To further explain the formative causes of these spatial patterns, a generalized additive model (GAM) was constructed by incorporating natural and social environmental factors. The results suggested that the distribution of cyber fraud was notably affected by the regional economy and population structure. Also, the high incidence of cyber fraud crime was closely associated with a large nonagricultural population, a high proportion of tertiary industry in GDP, a large number of general college students, a longer cable length, and a large numbers of internet users."
The information revolution, coupled with the strategic leveraging of the Internet, has exposed a number of relatively open societies to the dangers of cybercriminal and cyberterrorist acts, especially in commercial business transactions. With the development of e-commerce, this commercial dark side has become known as cybercrime and has taken on many forms that affect the perceptions of the way we shop online. Corporations should realize that these threats to their online businesses have strategic implications to their business future and take proper measures to ensure that these threats are eliminated or significantly reduced so that consumer confidence in the Internet as an alternative means of shopping is maintained. These counter measures, coined as cybersecurity, have been developed to ensure the safety of consumer privacy and information and allow for a carefree shopping experience. There is need for the development of models that will allow corporations to study the effects of cybercrime on online consumer confidence and to counter through leveraging the benefits associated with the latest developments in cybersecurity. With these two facets of e-commerce impacting the online consumer, corporations must ensure that the security measures taken will ultimately prevail to assure that consumers will continue to use the Internet to satisfy their shopping needs.
"The water and wastewater sector is an important lifeline upon which other economic sectors depend. Securing the sector's critical infrastructure is therefore important for any country's economy. Like many other nations, South Africa has an overarching national cybersecurity strategy aimed at addressing cyber terrorism, cybercriminal activities, cyber vandalism, and cyber sabotage. The aim of this study is to contextualise the water and wastewater sector's cybersecurity responsibilities within the national cybersecurity legislative and policy environment. This is achieved by conducting a detailed analysis of the international, national and sector cybersecurity stakeholders; legislation and policies; and challenges pertaining to the protection of the water and wastewater sector. The study found some concerning challenges and improvement gaps regarding the complex manner in which the national government is implementing the cybersecurity strategy. The study also found that, along with the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (the national cybersecurity strategy of South Africa), the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, and other supporting legislation and policies make provision for the water and wastewater sector's computer security incidents response team to be established without the need to propose any new laws or amend existing ones. This is conducive for the immediate development of the sector-specific cybersecurity governance framework and resilience strategy to protect the water and wastewater assets."
Online social networking sites have become very popular in this era due to easy accessibility of Internet. This popularity leads to continuous availability of multiple users, which resultantly attract more criminals and hence increasing insecurity in OSN. Different types of crimes are committed for multiple reasons in cyber realm by taking assistance of cyber technology. This insecure environment of OSN needs attention to prevent the damage caused by these crimes to society. Cyberbullying is reported as one of the harmful crimes causing psychological damage to victims. Cyberbullying has dangerous effects on the victim, which may also lead the victim to suicidal attempt. Victims of cyberbullying are usually afraid or embarrassed to reveal about their harassment. It has become a necessity to detect and prevent cyberbullying. Many researchers are working in multiple directions to achieve best results for automated cyberbullying detection. We have done a broad survey of all recent techniques proposed by researchers for cyberbullying detection and prediction. In the paper, we have presented taxonomy of multiple methods being used for cyberbullying detection. We also have presented a comparative analysis and classification of the work done in recent years.
Cybercrimes and cyberattacks have become serious threats to the internet-based life and work of people and organisations. Cyberdefenders and law enforcement have been waging a losing war against the determined and clever cybercriminals and cyberwarriors. The primary elements of cyberattack include hacking, malware, and DDoS attacks. This paper provides technical descriptions of how each element of cyberattack works, and what are some of the software tools used to aid it.
Scant research has investigated the illicit online ecosystem that enables the sale of stolen data. Even fewer studies have examined the longitudinal trends of the markets on which these data are bought and sold. To fill this gap in the literature, our research team identified 30 darknet markets advertising stolen data products from September 1, 2020, through April 30, 2021. We then developed python web scrapers to systematically extract information pertaining to stolen data products on a weekly basis. Using these data, we calculated the number of vendors, listings, sales, and revenue across the markets and at the aggregate, ecosystem level. Moreover, we developed a data-driven market classification system drawing from ecological principles and dominant firm theory. Findings indicate that markets vary in size and success. Although some markets generated over $91 million in revenue from stolen data products, the median revenue across markets during the observational period was only $95,509. Variability also exists across markets in respect to the number of vendors, listings, and sales. Only three markets were classified as financially successful and stable (i.e., dominant firms). We argue resources should be allocated to target markets fitting these criteria.
Card frauds are one of the most common types of banking frauds out of which card skimming contributes the major share. Investigation and prosecution of card skimming cases are mainly dependent on digital evidence requiring trained and skilled law enforcement officers. Further, a single incident of card skimming leads to collection of information from hundreds of cards and hence the identification of all the victims is the real challenge for an investigating officer. This paper discusses different issues pertaining to card skimming providing a general overview of the modus operandi, investigation process and constraints faced by law enforcement agencies.
Technology changes and improves, but sometimes progress in the field of information technology brings new challenges and can lead to problems with the law. Students tend to get in trouble with the law through improper use of mobile devices, cloud storages and unsafe internet resources. Photos taken, distributed through social media applications and stored in the cloud, browsing through data in the darknet (or deep web), cyber-mobbing and -bullying all these situations can cause kids and young adults to get in real trouble. The training of teenagers in this field is vital to keep them out of problems. There are a lot of institutions and organizations, both public and private which try to help teenagers in such situations, but social workers, lawyers, street-workers, judges, policemen and teachers are only able to show their point of view from their field of expertise. The combination of knowledge and information from specialists from different fields into courses, taught in schools is the proper way to deal with crimes caused by plain ignorance. This paper shows some typical situations, which may lead teenagers into trouble with the law based on real data from crime statistics and anonymized data from public trials furthermore it is shown how training courses could be created to solve these issues.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the risks to older adults of systemic abuse and neglect have become amplified, alongside increasing abuse and neglect in the community. Novel risks have also evolved involving cybercrime and the use of remote technologies in health and social care related to the pandemic. This commentary brings together lessons to be learned from these developments and initial ideas for actions to mitigate future risks.
This study utilized routine activity theory to examine the relationships between online behaviors, target suitability, and cyber and mobile phone-based bullying victimization in a nationally representative sample of youth from nine schools across Singapore. Key measures in all three categories-access to technology, online routine behaviors, and target suitability-were significant predictors of both forms of bullying victimization. In particular, females and victims of physical bullying were more likely to experience both forms of victimization. Access to technology and online routine behaviors predicted cyber and mobile phone-based bullying victimization differently. These findings demonstrate that routine activity theory is a viable framework to understand online bullying in non-Western nations, consistent with the existing literature on Western nations.
Terrorist attacks committed in the cyberspace represent a category of offences in the cyberspace, which refer to the abuses committed on the information and communication technology, this phenomenon being known also as cyberterrorism. In this study are analysed the most important legal instruments at European level in the field of prevention and combating terrorism: Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and the Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism which has been amended by the Council Framework Decision 2008/919/JHA of 28 November 2008. In relation to the express regulation of the use of Internet in relation to terrorist acts, here are presented the best examples within the two regulation areas existent at present in the literature: computer-related terrorist attacks and illegal content. Moreover, in this study is analysed from the point of view of Social Learning Theory the way in which Internet network is used to develop terrorist activities.
Over the last two decades, there has been a massive increase in research examining terror and extremist-related violence. Few have considered the extent to which these same groups may engage in attacks against digital infrastructure and the Internet, whether through hacking or other methods. The absence of empirical evidence calls to question the nature and dynamics of cyberattacks performed by extremists and ideologically motivated actors. This study attempted to address this gap in the literature through a qualitative investigation of 26 attacks performed by far-left groups against targets in the UK, US, and Canada from 2000 to 2015. This data was compared to physical attacks documented in the Extremist Crime Database during the same period. The findings demonstrated that there was an increase in cyberattacks during a period of decreased physical violence by far-left groups. Additionally, there was some parity in the targets of far-left groups on- and off-line, with similar motivations to cause harm to or embarrass businesses, government organizations, and individuals. The implications of this study for our understanding of terror and future research were discussed in detail.
The growth of electronic commerce and malicious software tools designed to compromise various payment systems and computer networks has led to concurrent increase in data breaches, phishing, and hacking incidents targeting sensitive financial information. As a function of this increase, an underground market economy has developed around the sale of consumers' bank account details and other financial information. Recent research examining data markets operating on the Open Web demonstrate their basic functions and distribution of information sold. Emerging evidence suggests markets are now operating on the Dark Web, or encrypted web sites operating on Tor-based networks. Little research to date has compared the distribution of victim nations in stolen data markets nor examined any variations between Open and Dark Web operations. This study utilizes a rational choice framework to examine this gap using a sample of 18 forums and 15 shops hosted on the Open Web and Tor. Using statistical analyses to examining the geography of victimization, this study provides a preliminary test of the applicability of rational choice theory to market operations.
The importance of this research arises from the increasing influence and quick development of self-learning programs in human life, which are the focus of this article's criminological investigation. Notably, the speed with which new partnerships are criminalized is not unique. However, the Act does not explicitly criminalize the usage of neural networks or AI for socially detrimental purposes. The author explores objective evidence of misconduct and deviance in AI answers. The research reveals that self-taught programs can impair public relations and put the public at risk. AI may fully implement the goal side of certain crimes in the future. The essay discusses using self-learning systems to commit crimes. The content of human intellectual and volitional behavior constitutes AI's guilt. It's also worth noting that AI-caused harm was caused by a system failing to perform its job adequately in most situations. Based on subjective indicators, AI-enabled product developers, makers, sellers, users, and others were identified. If given permission, AI can operate as a criminal psychologist.
A large increase has been shown in the number of cyberbullying cases among school students for the past decades. The rates of cyberbullying have increased due to the extensive use of mobile devices among the students. Thus, it is important to identify the factors of cyberbullying in order to address the issues appropriately. The aim of this research is to assess the association of cyberbullying victim with demographic profiles. This study focuses on different types of secondary school in Malaysia. A quantitative method was adopted in this study using survey questionnaires. Chi square test was used to test the association of cyberbullying victim with demographic profiles. Logistic Regression was used to determine the significant factors that contribute to the cyberbullying victim. The results indicate that the type of schools has significant impact to cyberbullying.
The global spread of technology and the Internet has produced unique threats that previously did not exist, such as computer hacking and the spread of malicious software to compromise computer systems. These acts have considerable economic and social consequences, leading them to be criminalized in most countries. Recent research with U.S. college samples have found that peer behavior and attitudes supportive of offending are correlated with involvement in hacking. Few have considered these relationships in a cross-national context, particularly with respect to the creation of malicious software. This study addresses these limitations through an examination of college students across three regions: the United States, Taiwan, and South Africa (N=1,065). The findings from this study demonstrate differences in the neutralizations and definitions associated with both hacking and malware use as well as regional influences on offending. The implications of this study for research on the techniques of neutralization are discussed in detail.
While the needs for generic IT staff have been generally addressed in many places, the lack of specialized workforce is a growing problem, especially in cybersecurity - falling behind in addressing cybercrime can lead to serious problems. Not only should the common cybersecurity awareness be raised, but more people should also be guided to specialize in cybersecurity. The cost of cybersecurity education and awareness campaigns is far less than the price of dealing with enormous consequences of cybercrime - in 2018, 600 Billion was reported in CSIS [17] by Internet Society, and it doubles annually. In some countries, the problem has been recognized more than in others. The Estonian CyberSecurity Strategy (2019) points out the need to educate all citizens, improve education in schools and find new talents for the field [11]. The new curriculum of Informatics of which 1 3 covers the cyber skills was developed in 2017, new materials will be available in 2019. In this paper we provide an overview of Estonian digital safety and cybersecurity curricula as well as discuss how to educate the masses and what to do with talents (how to detect talent and build up the talent pool). We will look at three years' work and studies (including the Cyber Olympics program) to offer ideas and perhaps inspiration to other countries. We also list a number of initiatives and tools that could help in updating the cybersecurity education and channeling resources in a more effective way.
"With the proliferation of the internet and increased global access to online media, cybercrime is also occurring at an increasing rate. Currently, both personal users and companies are vulnerable to cybercrime. A number of tools including firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be used as defense mechanisms. A firewall acts as a checkpoint which allows packets to pass through according to predetermined conditions. In extreme cases, it may even disconnect all network traffic. An IDS, on the other hand, automates the monitoring process in computer networks. The streaming nature of data in computer networks poses a significant challenge in building IDS. In this paper, a method is proposed to overcome this problem by performing online classification on datasets. In doing so, an incremental naive Bayesian classifier is employed. Furthermore, active learning enables solving the problem using a small set of labeled data points which are often very expensive to acquire. The proposed method includes two groups of actions i.e. offline and online. The former involves data preprocessing while the latter introduces the NADAL online method. The proposed method is compared to the incremental naive Bayesian classifier using the NSL-KDD standard dataset. There are three advantages with the proposed method: (1) overcoming the streaming data challenge; (2) reducing the high cost associated with instance labeling; and (3) improved accuracy and Kappa compared to the incremental naive Bayesian approach. Thus, the method is well-suited to IDS applications."
In the face of a possible computer crime or disciplinary offense in which digital elements have been used (as a means or as an end) and that is the subject of investigation, different procedures are required to know what, how, who and when the possible punishable act has occurred. The objective of this paper is the design of a methodology for the development of a forensic investigation. For this, the method used were the processes and methods accepted by the scientific and technical community for the adequate management and treatment of digital evidence (chain of custody), in order to be a technical support tool for administrative cases in Colombian government institutions within the context of Law 1952 of 2019. As a result, there is a proposal that can be used for the application of the General Disciplinary Code in terms of obtaining digital evidence, with which, it is concluded that the different researchers have at their disposal a process that can lead to optimal results, thereby comply with the law.
Regardless the level they're at and the referenced timeframe, economic exchanges are based on two fundamental elements - demand and supply. The new technologic revolution altered existing parameters, the transfer speed being strongly affected. Economic models unknown at the time were the basis of the development of new applied strategies that proved useful or lead to financial collapse. Liquidity deficits created as a result of wrong interpretations and the involvement of some financial- banking and insurance institutions in market regulation mechanisms spurred the emergence of international entities aimed at recovering and maintaining balance.
"Cyber threats and extortionate communications usually aim to influence the behavior or obtain compliance from victims. The phenomenon includes a wide range of forms, such as intimate partner violence; violence against women; dating abuse; sexual harassment; sexual coercion and extortion; etc. The victimization is linked to personal insecurity or disruption, mental and physical health, work or school performance, may represent a high financial burden, affecting negatively the sustainable development in a number of ways. The scale, scope, and challenges posed by this criminal phenomenon cannot be overstated. A deep analysis of the nature and extent of cyber extortion and threat is an essential component in the design of control strategies and programs. This research aims to provide an in-depth examination of the cyber threats and extortion phenomenon. The approach is interdisciplinary and empirically-informed. The analysis was done on a large number of cases and provides a comprehensive description of the essential characteristics of the phenomenon, including forms, communication vectors, and consequences for victims. The article concludes with recommendations for effectively addressing the phenomenon."
"Online advertising is a complex ecosystem that enables one of the most profitable businesses, which has become the target of abuse for botnets. For example, recent charges filed from the United States Department of Justice against the operators of the DNSChanger botnet stated that the botnet stole at least $14 million (Antonakakis et al., 2012; LawFuel Editors, 2014) from online advertisers during its lifetime just short of two years. In this paper we present a system, A(2)S, to analyze one of the most complex, sophisticated, and long-lived botnets: TDSS/TDL4. Using passive datasets from a large Intemet Service Provider in the United States, we estimated conservative lower bounds of advertisers' loss caused by the botnet. Over its entire life span, less than 15% of TDSS/TDL4 population caused at least $346 million in damages to advertisers, primarily due to impression fraud. This translates to an average of $340 thousand daily loss to advertisers, which is three times the last reported estimate from the analysis of ZeroAccess botnet (Pearce et al., 2014) and more than ten times of the daily impact the DNSChanger botnet (Meng et al., 2013) had to the ad ecosystem. Our study is the first to reveal the extent of the abuse that botnets bring to the ad ecosystem from the outside: the edge of the. Internet. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Information exchange has become increasingly faster and efficient through the use of recent technological advances, such as instant messaging and social media platforms. Consequently, access to information has become easier. However, new types of cybersecurity threats that typically result in data loss and information misuse have emerged simultaneously. Therefore, maintaining data privacy in complex systems is important and necessary, particularly in organizations where the vast majority of individuals interacting with these systems is students. In most cases, students engage in data breaches and digital misconduct due to the lack of knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity and the consequences of cybercrime. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the level of cybersecurity awareness and user compliance among undergraduate students at Majmaah University using a scientific questionnaire based on several safety factors for the use of the Internet. We quantitatively evaluated the knowledge of cybercrime and protection among students to show the need for user education, training, and awareness. In this study, we used a quantitative research methodology and conducted different statistical tests, such as ANOVA, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett's tests, to evaluate and analyze the hypotheses. Safety concerns for electronic emails, computer viruses, phishing, forged ads, popup windows, and supplementary outbreaks on the Internet were well-examined in this study. Finally, we present recommendations based on the collected data to deal with this common problem.
The procedure of the identification and analysis of electronic data is the digital forensics framework. The purpose of the procedure is to retain evidence in its primordial form by gathering, identifying and validating digital information in order to recreate events of the past. For the use of data in a court of law, the context is most appropriate. The evidence aspect of digital forensics requires strict requirements to be followed in court for cross-examination. One major pitfall in the digital forensic analysis is the possible admissibility of collected evidence in the court of law. Digital forensic analysis must comply with the quality of evidence and its admissibility to trial successfully. In this work, we proposed a new network forensic investigation process model. We precisely establish a methodology of investigation for the computer network.
Synthetic audio and video content are enormously growing in the Internet world today, creating many problems in recent years. The use of techniques such as artificial intelligence over multimedia to create fake content is known as DeepFake. It challenges the reality and genuineness of the created high-quality audio and video content. The synthetic media created is almost similar to the real media, and with bare eyes, it is almost impossible to differentiate them. Though the DeepFake has also been a boon in many multimedia fields such as film making, advertising, and animation industry to create magnetic media, it has also become a threat to society. There is software available across the Internet that can be used even by a novice to create fake multimedia contents that look very realistic and used for various criminal activities. The applications such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok use multimedia as its contents. Social media applications can be easily falsified and can cause severe threats both personally and psychologically using DeepFake technology. Hence, there is a need for tools to detect the forged contents in the media to check and authenticate the data's genuineness and integrity. This chapter highlights the various challenges the human race faces because of the DeepFake technology and the limitation of different forensic tools available to analyze and forecast the challenging future and understand the solutions incorporated to secure the current data situation.
The objective of this article was to identify the characteristics of crime investigation in the action of provoking someone's suicide on the Internet, identifying the main problems, characteristics of the investigation and prospects for improvement of the crime investigation methodology. For the development of the article the following methods were used to meet the objectives: comparative legal method, historical and comparative methods, which made it possible to analyze the state, problems, and prospects for the development of Ukrainian legislation in the field of liability for causing someone to commit suicide. The article also involves the method of systematization, which provided the opportunity to study the genesis and changes in the legislation that regulates the matter. It was concluded that there was a lack of good practices and an effective system for investigating Internet crimes, due to the peculiarities of the development and use of the Internet, as well as rapid technological advancement. Comparing the experience of the EU and the US, it was determined that preventive and educational functions are the main ones in this area, helping to prevent relevant crimes.
In this paper, we describe a new type of online fraud, referred to as 'eWhoring' by offenders. This crime script analysis provides an overview of the 'eWhoring' business model, drawing on more than 6,500 posts crawled from an online underground forum. This is an unusual fraud type, in that offenders readily share information about how it is committed in a way that is almost prescriptive. There are economic factors at play here, as providing information about how to make money from 'eWhoring' can increase the demand for the types of images that enable it to happen. We find that sexualised images are typically stolen and shared online. While some images are shared for free, these can quickly become 'saturated', leading to the demand for (and trade in) more exclusive 'packs'. These images are then sold to unwitting customers who believe they have paid for a virtual sexual encounter. A variety of online services are used for carrying out this fraud type, including email, video, dating sites, social media, classified advertisements, and payment platforms. This analysis reveals potential interventions that could be applied to each stage of the crime commission process to prevent and disrupt this crime type.
Cybercrimes are emerging trends on the Internet. Free instant communications, like LINE or WhatsApp, bring close to our family and friends around the globe. People in Taiwan use LINE application more frequently than others. This study uses Wireshark to explore the cybercriminal behind the LINE voice calls. Some algorithms are identified to the criminal's IP address by way of LINE voice calls. It will be helpful for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) to prosecute cybercriminals, and bring them to justice.
As critical systems are increasingly dependent on software and are connected to the Internet, insider threats will be of ongoing concern. For example, corrupt insiders could deliberately introduce malicious software into the organisation's system to surreptitiously gain control, and launch online attacks via and against compromised systems. In this paper, we present a method that an insider can use to facilitate data exfiltration from an air-gapped system without using any modified hardware. The method presented here uses inaudible sounds transmitted from the target machine's speakers, which can transfer data to a nearby computer equipped with a microphone. We demonstrate how inaudible communication bridge air-gapped systems without any additional hardware. Our system is low-risk for an insider as it only requires one-off access to a system, and can be erased leaving little-to-no trace once it is no longer required. Finally we provide some recommendations for organisations to avoid similar data exfiltration techniques.
Artificial intelligence is really a kind of computerized version of human intelligence. The way artificial intelligence works is like learning iteratively again and again, just like humans. In this generation, the threat of landscape is unquestionably evolving. The cyber attackers are entirely focused on financial rewards. But the department has found a new way to prevent attacks before they occur, as the old traditional way can no longer be relied upon. This paper introduces the need for the development of cybersecurity skills and how artificial intelligence can be implied to improve skills through the use of artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms.
The fifth generation of cellular networks (5G) will enable different use cases where security will be more critical than ever before (e.g. autonomous vehicles and critical IoT devices). Unfortunately, the new networks are being built on the certainty that security problems cannot be solved in the short term. Far from reinventing the wheel, one of our goals is to allow security software developers to implement and test their reactive solutions for the capillary network of 5G devices. Therefore, in this paper a solution for analysing proximity-based attacks in 5G environments is modelled and tested using OMNET++. The solution, named CRAT, is able to decouple the security analysis from the hardware of the device with the aim to extend the analysis of proximity-based attacks to different use-cases in 5G. We follow a high-level approach, in which the devices can take the role of victim, offender and guardian following the principles of the routine activity theory.
The aim of our research is to check if public services' digitalization has an influence on economic and financial crime. We split economic and financial crime into its main forms and measured them using relevant indicators. For public services' digitalization we consider indicators regarding online services' quality, telecommunication infrastructure and e-government involvement. We also consider control variables that might affect the nexus between the main variables. Our sample comprise 185 countries, being split by developed and developing countries. Our processings are done in Eviews7, using Panel Least Squared Method. We test the relationship between public services' digitalization and each component of economic and financial crime. The conclusions show a decrease of economic and financial crime with an increase of public services' digitalization. In some particular cases, for developing countries we can observe a slight increase of the phenomenon. Our study completes the specialized literature because it includes a wider sample and a more complex set of indicators. It can also be very useful in developing national strategies and policies regarding the economic and financial crime issue. Digitalization is not a cause for concern when law is respected. If we have functional policies, technology will become citizen's most accessible tool.
This research includes the examination of the views of pre-service teachers on cybercrimes. For this purpose, it was aimed to determine the students' opinions about their preventive attitude towards these crimes. The study was carried out with 282 pre-service teachers at the Near East University Ataturk Education Faculty in Northern Cyprus in the 2018-2019 academic year. In the study, personal information form, validity and reliability provided by Gozler and Tasci (2015) and the Student Opinion Scale on Informatics Concepts and Crimes were used as data collection tools. According to the findings of the study, it was concluded that general views of pre-service teachers on informatics concepts and cybercrimes are at a moderate level and education on this subject should be increased.
Objective: To awareness in securing digital data either offline or online. Technology or Method: Based on literature studies that have been done, the increase in Internet users is not comparable with increased awareness of data security or information by users, which causes vulnerability to users of losing their data. Result: This paper will provide recommendations for securing data, which is cryptographic techniques and steganography. Cryptography is an art or science of keeping data or message security, while steganography is the science of hiding messages or data into a media. Users in performing data security can use these techniques, data security applications are already widely provided by developers of data security. Regular change of passwords in various accounts on Internet services is also one of the ways to secure accounts and data stored on Internet services. Conclusion: Based on the recommendation by the Internet users can minimize the theft or destruction of digital data by cyber criminals.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or things implanted with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to allow them to exchange data with servers, centralized systems, and other connected devices using several communication systems. IoT data is assembled from various sensors, nodes, and collectors and sent to the cloud. It is the most reliable framework for improving the quality and comfort of human life. It has made a substantial contribution to a wide range of applications. By 2020, it is expected that 31 billion IoT devices will be deployed worldwide. The rapid growth of smart devices and their reliance on wireless mechanics for data transfer have increased their vulnerability to cyberattacks. As a result, studying IoT security dangers and viable countermeasures can aid academics in discovering acceptable solutions to various cybercrime investigation challenges. In this study, various security vulnerabilities at each layer are also examined in-depth and corrective options for smart city applications and Industry 4.0. A comparison analysis of IoT/IIoT wireless communication features and security challenges in IoT systems is also part of this study. The relevance of IoT forensics in cybercrime investigation in many areas such as smart homes, smart cities, automated cars, and healthcare is also discussed in this study. This article presents IoT security concerns and open issues, laying the groundwork for future research.
Amid the rapid growth of Internet users, cybercrime is becoming one of the most challenging tasks for the systems and applications designers to deal with. The cybercrime threat is reflected in the increased number of cases and methods used by criminals. Systems based on cloud computing are natural targets due to their complexity (greater room for security weaknesses) and increasing popularity. Cloud computing is a modern technology that enables users to share resources in a virtual storage and computing environment. A cloud system is based on multiple physical servers. It provides a universal environment with a (large) number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that is available to many users accessing this system via the Internet. This form of access makes cloud systems weaker than physical networks. In order to prevent or minimize the number of attacks and in turn to secure data storage, any malicious behaviour such as external undesirable interventions should be rapidly identified and halted if possible. In this paper, we focus on the discovery of malicious behaviour via determining unwanted symptoms rather than via targeting particular malicious behaviours of the system directly. The main contribution of this paper consists in several new mechanisms for monitoring Virtual Machines and further experimental work targeting efficient ways of visiting VMs in order to discover malicious symptoms. We want to find the fastest and the best set of weights for visiting VMs.
In this extended and updated paper, the experimental construction of a new attacker typology grounded in real-life data is proposed, using grounded theory analysis and over 300 publicly available documents containing details of digital banking related cybercrime and involved attackers. Seven attacker profiles forming the typology specific to the case of digital banking are presented. An initial light-touch evaluation approach based on peer review feedback and basic heuristics is suggested. A short excursus on circumplex models is added to address this visualisation tool used across past categorisation efforts.
This study aims to evaluate the Islamic family inheritance laws of various Muslim nations and the cybercrime issues associated with these laws. The Quran contains Allah Almighty's just and equitable teaching regarding the equitable distribution of a deceased person's property among his legal successors. Violating these constraints and Islamic laws renders a person a miscreant before the Almighty on the Day of Judgement and legally. As a result, many Muslim nations strictly adhere to the inheritance guidelines that Islam has outlined. In addition, the present research aims to assess the impact of cybercrimes on inheritance laws by identifying how cybercriminals can violate legal constraints and break the law for their benefit. Numerous practical and theoretical implications result from the research. As this research contributes to the expanding corpus of literature on Islamic inheritance laws in Muslim countries, a global perspective is taken. This research has multiple practical benefits for practitioners in Muslim nations that oversee legal regulations. As cybercrime has also negatively influenced the breaching or violating of laws, policymakers of Muslim countries have been provided with useful insights through this research to amend the legislations and legal laws and impose severe punishments on those who violate these laws or engage in cybercriminal activities. The limitations of the investigation are also discussed in this study.
Digital evidence underpin the majority of crimes as their analysis is an integral part of almost every criminal investigation. Even if we temporarily disregard the numerous challenges in the collection and analysis of digital evidence, the exchange of the evidence among the different stakeholders has many thorny issues. Of specific interest are cross-border criminal investigations as the complexity is significantly high due to the heterogeneity of legal frameworks, which beyond time bottlenecks can also become prohibiting. The aim of this article is to analyse the current state of practice of cross-border investigations considering the efficacy of current collaboration protocols along with the challenges and drawbacks to be overcome. Further to performing a legally oriented research treatise, we recall all the challenges raised in the literature and discuss them from a more practical yet global perspective. Thus, this article paves the way to enabling practitioners and stakeholders to leverage horizontal strategies to fill in the identified gaps timely and accurately.
During the past few years, social engineering has rapidly evolved and has become a mainstream technique in cybercrime and terrorism. It is used especially in targeted attacks involving complex human and technological exploits, aimed at deceiving humans and IT systems. Building on the work carried out in the DOGANA project, funded by the European Union, this paper provides an overview of the evolution and of the current landscape of social engineering, and introduces as its main contribution a theoretical model of how human exploits are built, named the Victim Communication Stack.
The increasing militarisation of cyber-space comes in response to fears of critical damage caused by digital weapons like Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). Understanding that the botnets are the key platform behind DDoS, we compared the costs of running a large-scale attack with the approximate downtime loss in a country-scale attack in case of Serbia, showing that DDoS are readily available weapons of possible mass disruption. Taken as a whole, this paper suggests responding to risks by combating cybercrime as the DDoS enabler, rather than by militarisation.
"Over the last few years, there has been a steady increase in smart home technology's pervasiveness, to the degree where consumer IoT is part of many homes. As our homes become complex cyber-physical spaces, the risk to our physical security from attacks originating in cyberspace becomes much more significant. Within the literature, there is much discussion about the technical vulnerabilities within the smart home. However, this is often not linked to a rich understanding of how an attacker could exploit them. In this paper, we focus on residential burglary and develop a rich understanding of the process by which residential burglary is committed and the effect of the smart home on this process. By combining two areas of the academic literature, residential burglary and smart-home security, this paper provides an academically grounded discussion that places the nascent vulnerabilities associated with the smart-home into the context of the process by which burglary is committed. The commission of residential burglary is a complex decision-making process, which the public often simplifies into planned or unplanned crimes; this is a dangerous oversimplification. The analysis identifies some increased risk during the target selection stage phase. However, in the short term, residential burglars are unlikely to exploit smart home technology routinely.

Longitudinal criminological studies greatly improved our understanding of the longitudinal patterns of criminality. These studies, however, focused almost exclusively on traditional types of offending and it is therefore unclear whether results are generalizable to online types of offending. This study attempted to identify the developmental trajectories of active hackers who perform web defacements. The data for this study consisted of 2,745,311 attacks performed by 66,553 hackers and reported to Zone-H between January 2010 and March 2017. Semi-parametric group-based trajectory models were used to distinguish six different groups of hackers based on the timing and frequency of their defacements. The results demonstrated some common relationships to traditional types of crime, as a small population of defacers accounted for the majority of defacements against websites. Additionally, the methods and targeting practices of defacers differed based on the frequency with which they performed defacements generally.
The authors seek to understand the relationship between the outcomes of traditional Security Education Training & Awareness (SETA) programs, which have been popular in Information Systems (IS) as a mechanism to protect users from cybercrime. The issue is that most SETA programs in IS change at the pace much slower than the pace of cybercriminal tactics. Therefore, the authors propose viewing SETA outcomes through the lens of the psychological concept of resiliency. This paper proposes a model that extends reputable resiliency theories and models to the field of IS Security.
Purpose:The prevalence of cyberstalking, with its substantial harm to victims, highlights the importance of identifying the factors contributing to its occurrence. This study assesses, through an advanced three-level metaanalytic approach, the relative predictive validity of sociodemographic, background, risk, and protective domains of predictors associated with cyberstalking perpetration and victimization. Methods:In each domain, multiple subdomains were measured for dozens of individual contributing factors. An extensive systematic search yielded 57 eligible studies, describing 54 independent samples between 2002 and 2022 with 515 effect sizes. Results:Multilevel meta-analysis results revealed that the background domain had the largest composite effect sizes for both cyberstalking perpetration and victimization, followed by the risk domain, whereas sociodemographic and protective domains had no significant effect. According to the moderator analyses, the effect sizes of background and risk domains varied depending on the age of the sample and the country of the data, highlighting the need for future synthesis studies to identify the unique contributing factors to cyberstalking in adult samples from various countries. Conclusions:Findings from this meta-analysis provide valuable evidence for the development of primary prevention and risk assessment-management, as well as cyberstalking security and guardianship.
Since its presentation by Apple, both the iPhone and iPad devices have achieved a great success and gained widespread popularity. This fact, added to the given idiosyncrasies of these new portable devices and the kind of data they may store open new opportunities in the field of computer forensics. In 2010, version 4 of their operating system (iOS) introduced AirPrint, a simple and driverless wireless printing functionality supported by some network printers. This paper presents an analysis of the traces left by AirPrint and assesses whether it is feasible to recover them in the context of a forensic investigation.
The age of the internet has thrown down some real challenges to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Recently, the Government made changes to this piece of legislation, in an attempt to meet two of those challenges-the proliferation of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and the creation and dissemination of Hackers' tools-and to fulfil international commitments on cybercrime. Yet some of these new measures invite criticisms of policy, form and content, and bring doubts about how easy to interpret, and how enforceable, they will be.
Most cyber threats and attacks on a system, an organisation or a nation have significant consequences, especially on missions, and can affect even an unintended target. Nigeria is vulnerable to such threats, the most pressing of which is cybercrime that sabotage economic prosperity and damage reputation. This cybercrime is a result of (mostly internal) cybercriminal threats exploiting weaknesses in high population lacking security consciousness, inadequate low-level security controls, poor governmental sustainable commitment, poverty and lack of capacity. Nigerian National Cyber Security Strategy (NNCSS) needs to be optimized to consider Nigerian peculiarity and concepts critical to strategy development. For instance, Nigerian electronic fraud forum (NEFF) is the only partnership scheme cutting across different sectors and is tailored towards monetary transaction. We, therefore, identified critical control issues in NNCSS, give suggestions to strengthen NNCSS-an algorithmic step for risk based strategy development and an adjustment to the institutional setting. Considered all together, a framework of a model to enhance the strategy is given. Nigeria is a strategic country-known for some cyber threats, and an enhancement of its existing cyber security strategic approaches will not only ensure adequate security to the country but also others. For example, cooperation, a significant element of strategy, fostered at various levels (international through local) strengthens the course of nations efforts to cyber security.
The rise in the usage of cyberspace and technologies has introduced innovative ways for cybercrimes. Businesses are vulnerable to various cybercrimes, which eventually leaves them exposed. Cyber threats mostly attack businesses and ultimately cause cybercrimes. In most cases, networked devices become a primary target to commit cybercrimes. Cybercrimes come in the form of a cyber-threat, including information security threats and intrusion, which eventually cost money. These threats mostly come as cyberattacks such as malware, denial of service, data breaches, password attacks, device or network exploitation, and phishing attacks. While small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) conveniently use the Internet benefits for instant service delivery, cybercrimes simultaneously quantified to disrupt the business plan, resulting in significant information loss, fraud, and financial loss. This paper reports the common cyber crimes caused by information security threats, fraud attempts, and intrusion threats. The article further reports the impact of cyber threats on businesses. For this purpose, this investigation considered 20 SMBs as a sample. Due to the COVID19 Pandemic, an online survey was employed to collect data, and the content analysis was used to interpret and analyze to draw the results. Findings revealed that cybercrimes are a common challenge to all SMBs. Results also showed that SMBs were affected by cybercrimes related to malicious code attempts (malware), intrusion (unauthorized access and modification of data), fraud (robbery, inside attempts, and the use of the memory sticks). Humans cause some cybercrimes. Businesses reported that cybercrimes directly affects business performance, business continuity, customer trust, business reputation, and economic growth. The paper concluded with recommendations for future work.
Although there exists a growing amount of empirical literature documenting the correlates of cyberstalking victimization, research has yet to elaborate on the potential mechanisms that can explain the risk for cyberstalking victimization. We proposed an integrated theory, which combined low self-control, control deficit, peers' online deviant behavior, and online deviant lifestyles based on previous research. We tested this integrated theory specifically for cyberstalking victimization using original data from a sample of 408 Iranian college women. Relying on structural equation modeling, we found that low self-control and peers' online deviant behaviors were significantly associated with cyberstalking victimization not only directly but also indirectly via online deviant lifestyles. Overall, our findings yielded strong support for the integrated model to explain cyberstalking victimization.
The study of cryptocurrency as an economic tool has been the focus of attention of states and the international community over the past ten years. Many economists and government officials are very skeptical about the use of cryptocurrency by business entities. Using the anonymity of transactions carried out via the Internet the criminal world, on the contrary, conduct illegal transactions, for example, engage in money laundering, finance terrorism and extremism, promote the development of marketing channels for drugs and psychotropic substances. This kind of research is one of the first for the Republic of Kazakhstan. In this research, the authors tried to identify the potential opportunities and threats to the development of the cryptocurrency market in the context of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Based on the analysis of international practices in the field of cryptocurrency market regulation, as well as the expert interviewing conducted by the authors, 2 main problems of cryptocurrency market development in Kazakhstan are identified. Firstly, the security problems of using cryptocurrency in the context of technical support, secondly, the lack of regulatory infrastructure for the development of the crypto currency market in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Finally, the authors come to the conclusion that the Republic of Kazakhstan is currently not ready to develop the cryptocurrency market, since there are a number of organizational and legal issues. Nevertheless, the authors are convinced that Kazakhstan should be part of the global crypto market and should be actively involved in the development, implementation and regulation of the cryptocurrency market
"Cyberspace is a very real man-made environment. Like any physical realm, while it offers potential for progress and benefits, it also offers opportunities for misconduct, and cyber criminals and cyber terrorists are continually searching out weaknesses in the defences that have been erected against them. There is one weakness that is pervasive across society: our individual lack of awareness, and of how to protect ourselves and our organisations against cyber attack. This paper reports on an EU funded project called SUCCEED (Shaping University Curricula to Critical Infrastructure Employer Needs) which seeks to reduce that vulnerability through education; specifically, we want to advise Higher Education Institutions of measures by which curricula can be augmented to ensure that all graduates have an appropriate level of cyber savvy. The paper's structure reflects the project's straightforward approach: first we identified what is needed in terms of knowledge and understanding of how to be protected in cyberspace; second we examined current provision (primarily to identify gaps, but also to refer to best-practice); third we will outline recommendations based on our findings from the first and second phases; and fourth we will have these recommendations validated by relevant stakeholders (including representatives from industry, government organisations and academia) in order to distil our conclusions, which will be disseminated and exploited further as final contributions of the project. This paper presents current progress of the SUCCEED project, in particular the results and findings obtained from the first two phases of the project. This is a relatively modest project, and will not claim to provide a definitive solution. However, we believe it can provide an important first step towards an enrichment of curricula that will better prepare graduates to cope with the dangers and risks from terrorists and cyber criminals in the digital future they will all participate in. Only thus can they SUCCEED in cyberspace, by staying safe and secure in the digital realm -through education."
The online dating romance scam is an Advance Fee Fraud, typically conducted by international criminal groups via online dating sites and social networking sites. This type of mass-marketing fraud (MMF) is the most frequently reported type of MMF in most Western countries. This study examined the psychological characteristics of romance scam victims by comparing romance scam victims with those who had never been scammed by MMFs. Romance scam victims tend to be middle-aged, well-educated women. Moreover, they tend to be more impulsive (scoring high on urgency and sensation seeking), less kind, more trustworthy, and have an addictive disposition. It is argued here that these findings might be useful for those developing prevention programs and awareness campaigns.
Although information technology's positive impacts on businesses and individuals are substantial, cybercrime continues to represent one of the greatest threats in the digital world. Advances in biometric technology's capabilities hold promise for solving this problem by offering users greater protection, but more legislative and social-policy work is needed to help realize the technology's full potential. In the near term, however, organizations can begin by incorporating users' security and privacy concerns into their biometric policies in terms of data collection, storage, access, and use.
We report the synthesis and photoluminescence (PL) behavior of a new molecular system, which is composed of three positional isomers. They exhibit isomeric effects on both aggregation-induced emission (ME) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanisms. Furthermore, one of them, Le., (E)-5-methoxy-2-(((6-methylbenzo [d]thiazol-2-yl)imino)methyl)phenol (MTP3), shows unique mechanochromic fluorescence (MCF) phenomenon. Unlike most MCF materials that would function immediately after applying mechanical force, the MCF character of this material is however recessive with mechanical force, but becomes visible upon fumigation treatment. Given that the MCF is activated under specific conditions, it is termed as conditional mechanochromic fluorescence (CMCF) in this study. In light of the CMCF property of MTP3, a new data encryption-decryption technique was developed. Binary data and complex patterns can be recorded by mechanical force and concealed on the tailor-made data storage. The encoded data cannot be read unless it is fumed by organic vapour, demonstrating a successful encryption-decryption technique. The CMCF offers great potential to be the alternative to encryption algorithms and may contribute greatly to data security and cybercrime prevention.
Brexit is likely to have an effect on UK-EU cyber security cooperation. While there are ongoing reasons to be positive about the state of UK-EU cyber security, Tim Stevens and Kevin O'Brien show how Brexit will have negative impacts on cybercrime policing and cyber threat intelligence sharing, particularly in a no-deal' scenario, and argue that the absence of a negotiated settlement will damage the cyber security of the UK and the EU.
Cybercrime is everywhere in cyberspace. Cybersecurity is a set of technologies, processes and policies to protect the enterprise information asset to prevent business loss assets from the cyber attackers. Planning a sustainable and reliable cybersecurity system is an essential initial step since the large amount of investment on the system has long lasting impact. This paper introduces a multiple criteria decision making method using the Primitive Cognitive Network Process (PCNP) for the cyber-security investment decision making.
In today's world, a multidimensional corporate security strategy has never been more essential for protecting physical assets, intellectual property and human life. The globalization of business means that companies often have offices in far-flung locations where local laws, public safety and political unrest create risk. Even on home soil, the threats of workplace violence, active shooters and terrorism call for more-sophisticated and coordinated vigilance, while the growing threat of cybercrime adds another layer of vulnerability to critical organizational assets.
Fiji faces consistent dangers and possible assaults on different data resources. As such it is basic to comprehend the current danger scene of Fiji, the enactments used to dissuade IT related wrongdoing and the weaknesses of such enactments. This research has been undertaken through an investigation of recent media postings and an assessment of research articles and legislations. As needs be, Fiji experiences a wide assortment of dangers and assaults, for example, music theft, digital harassing, sextortion, email compromises and spoofing, scams, cyclones, loss of power and so on. The fundamental enactment used to indict cybercrimes is the Crimes Decree 2009 alongside other applicable enactment, for example, the Copyright Act 1999 and other auxiliary enactments. Fiji Legislations experiences an assortment of shortcomings concerning absence of capacity to deal with the unpredictable and differed cybercrimes, absence of least guidelines and trouble in doing fruitful indictments. Fiji may improve these enactments by looking to nations like United States of America or European Union. Moreover, it very well might be vital for understudies and staff of the IT field to be all around familiar with their legitimate commitments and guarantee they endeavor to refresh their insight into current dangers and assaults and not depend absolutely on enactments to discourage cyber criminals.
A deepfake might attract liability for crimes that violate human dignity, identity, and privacy, known as crimen iniuria under the South African common law. The deepfake would have to contain some form of sexual impropriety or indecency to yield a conviction for crimen iniuria. The common law protection is broad enough to treat personality impairment using criminal liability, but it may not be sufficient to address cybercrimes relating to the infringement of identity through deepfakes. The South African Parliament has adopted the Cybercrimes Bill B6B-2017, which creates a statutory offence for fraud, forgery, uttering and unlawfully and intentionally disseminating intimate images through data messages. The Cybercrimes Bill B6B-2017 incorporates a proviso that the victim must have a reasonable expectation of privacy to yield a successful conviction for the latter crimes. The requirement of a reasonable expectation is peculiar because it is a civil law requirement for violating privacy stated as a requirement to secure a criminal conviction. This paper investigates when using another person's identity in deepfakes can result in a prosecution under the Cybercrimes Bill. This paper also looks to the United States of America by focusing on the Texas Election Code (Texas Senate Bill 751 (SB751), the first state law to regulate deepfakes in the United States of America.
The purpose of the present study is to contribute to the gap in the literature by investigating the sexting behaviors of adolescents under the age of 18 and how these behaviors are related to internet related problems. Using data collected from high school students in a rural county in western North Carolina, results indicated that deviant peer association and Internet-related problems were in fact associated with sexting by juveniles.
This article examines how technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation has flourished within the laissez faire regulatory frameworks of neoliberalism, and argues that political economy should play a more central role in theorising about child sexual abuse. Drawing on the case study of Omegle, a livestreaming website that matches strangers via webcam, the paper illustrates how deregulatory trends have produced an alignment between the sexual interests of child sexual abusers and the economic interests of some online service providers. The paper suggests that intersecting political ideologies and economic structures have increased opportunities for child sexual exploitation and decreased formal and informal controls, while recruiting paedophilic desires and exploitative subjectivities within processes of capital accumulation. The paper explores the implications of political economy for theories of child sex offending, which have typically focused on the psychological, social and legal dimensions of child sexual abuse while overlooking the role of capitalist structures and imperatives.
Security messages, as a form of information security awareness training, are designed to encourage individuals to make an informed security decision, reducing their susceptibility to online victimization. To date, no known study has assessed the effectiveness of security messages or whether the effectiveness of these messages varies based on the recipients' characteristics. Using a randomized controlled trial, this study tests the efficacy of security messages on reducing SMiShing victimization, then assesses whether thoughtfully reflective decision-making (TRDM) moderates the effect of these messages on victimization by launching simulated attacks against participants of the study. Findings reveal that neither security messages nor TRDM directly affect SMiShing victimization. However, security messages effectively prevent victimization when the message recipient has higher TRDM levels. The interaction between TRDM and security messages demonstrates the relevance of criminological theory and the importance of interdisciplinary scholarship in understanding how human behavior influences the effectiveness of cybersecurity practices.
We examine different opportunities to implement the blockchain technology into online payment and sales transaction systems with a focus on the financial sector of the German speaking area in Europe. To this end, we conduct a literature review and conduct a questionnaire survey among payment transaction experts. In addition the advantages and disadvantages are pointed out as well as other applications. Results from the survey suggest that many experts are investigating the new technology, but the efforts made at Austrian, German and Swiss banks are low since there are still many open issues pending. Especially setting up a legal framework for the international treatment of payment transactions based on the blockchain would be an important step.
"Recent official statistics have highlighted for the first time in the UK, the nature and extent of computer fraud and cybercrime against individuals and households. This has in turn posed questions about the adequacy and the speed of the police response to these newly highlighted crimes. At the same time, the Public Accounts Committee has pressed for more co-ordination of efforts to counter cybercrime against government departments (Protecting Information Across Government; available at https://www.publications.parliamnent.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmpubac/769/76902.htm; accessed 3 February 2017). Although a number of useful initiatives have already been put in place, by the Home Office and police forces, into understanding and responding to these threats the article claims that much more needs to done, particularly in changing policing structures, in recruitment, in training, and in coordination of work across agencies. The article considers the current police response, the potential problems confronting change management arising from police organisational culture. It does however identify successful police modernization programmes that have enabled police services, outside Europe, to both restructure and recruit appropriate personnel in response to a changing criminal environment which now confronts them. It argues that in a similar way new demands on the police service will require it to significantly review its capabilities which may impact on traditional commitments to capacity."
Digital forensics is an essential discipline for both law enforcement agencies and businesses. It makes possible to investigate electronic related crimes aka cybercrime such as fraud, industrial espionage and computer misuse. However, encryption, anti-forensic tools and the ever increasing amount of volume of data to analyse creates a wide range of challenges to overcome. Fortunately, other computer fields can be applied to overcome those challenges. This paper will explore some data mining techniques to address most common issues in Digital Forensics.
COVID-19 caused a great burden on the healthcare system and led to lockdown measures across the globe. These measures are likely to influence crime rates, but a comprehensive overview on the impact of COVID-19 on crime rates is lacking. The aim of the current study was to systematically review evidence on the impact of COVID-19 measures on crime rates across the globe. We conducted a systematic search in several databases to identify eligible studies up until 6-12-2021. A total of 46 studies were identified, reporting on 99 crime rates about robberies (n = 12), property crime (n = 15), drug crime (n = 5), fraud (n = 5), physical violence (n = 15), sexual violence (n = 11), homicides (n = 12), cybercrime (n = 3), domestic violence (n = 3), intimate partner violence (n = 14), and other crimes (n = 4). Overall, studies showed that most types of crime temporarily declined during COVID-19 measures. Homicides and cybercrime were an exception to this rule and did not show significant changes following COVID-19 restrictions. Studies on domestic violence often found increased crime rates, and this was particularly true for studies based on call data rather than crime records. Studies on intimate partner violence reported mixed results. We found an immediate impact of COVID-19 restrictions on almost all crime rates except for homicides, cybercrimes and intimate partner violence.
Releases of usernames and passwords, referred to as credential dumps, have become an increasingly popular shared resource over the past decade, especially within underground communities. The sharing of compromised credentials by cyber-criminals is done in order to demonstrate technical capability, increase reputation, and to augment one's legitimacy within criminal communities. There has been minimal research demonstrating standardized methods for identifying the distribution of credential dumps or the origin(s) of where a dump first surfaced. There has also been a lack of research related to the open source intelligence that can be obtained through tracing the distribution of dumps across the Internet. This research presents a method called REAPER which demonstrates how to leverage unique data points within credential dumps to identify its distribution, while also providing an in-depth look into the intelligence that can be gained by observing the criminal activities associated with the credentials dumped.
E-mail spam has been growing since its inception. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN SPAM Act) is U.S. federal legislation that was passed in response to the growing spam problem. A series of evaluations followed after the Act, most of which reported that compliance with the Act's requirements among spammers had not been affected. However, none of these evaluations used methods that were sufficiently rigorous, failing to capture the continuous nature of CAN SPAM Act's enforcement, using a limited number of measures of noncompliance, and ignoring a variety of possible spurious influences. This research addresses all of these limitations by analyzing a sample of 5,490,905 spam e-mails sent between 1998 and 2013. Ten measures of spammer compliance with the CAN SPAM Act were operationalized to test the impact the Act had. Thirteen measures of CAN SPAM Act enforcement were coded from news articles and included in a time-series regression. Findings suggest that the Act may in fact be a deterrent, but in such a way as to increase CAN SPAM Act violations of header forgery as a precaution against being caught.
This paper deals with at least four major cyber safety concerns in Africa discussed in recent literature. These cyber concerns include aspects such as policies, procedure, awareness, research and the provision of technical security measures. Each concern is examined, the main focus areas are highlighted and a solution is proposed. This paper concludes by combining all relevant solutions into a proposed cyber security framework to assist Africa in decreasing its cybercrime rate especially among home users with no or limited cyber safety knowledge.
Transnational state-sponsored cyber economic espionage poses a threat to the economy of developed countries whose industry is largely reliant on the value of information. In the face of rapid technological development facilitating cyber economic espionage from afar on a massive scale, the law has not developed apace to effectively address this problem. Applicable United States domestic laws have been ineffective in addressing the problem due to lack of enforcement jurisdiction, sovereign immunity, and inability to hold the state sponsor accountable. Customary international law principles offer little help in combatting the issue, as countermeasures are typically unavailable since espionage may not be ongoing by the time a victimized state can confidently attribute it to a state and retortions are a relatively weak response. Although existing treaties have not been effective in addressing this problem, a multilateral global treaty specifically addressing transnational state-sponsored cyber economic espionage may be a promising way forward.
This paper considers emerging challenges and opportunities confronting criminology in the age of Big Data. The mass proliferation of digital media/recording devices into social life is transforming in profound ways how crime is organized, perpetrated, experienced, represented, detected and controlled. Moreover, the extensive daily use of these technologies by institutions and individuals alike produces immense quantities of data that mediate social events, actions and experiences in significant, if subtle, ways. Such data are means of communication, knowledge and entertainment, as well as resources for analytic and criminal manipulation and community mobilization. We suggest that criminology must develop a digital specialism which investigates the multifaceted role performed by digital technologies as intersectional and transformative mediums in the crime and justice field.
"The critical importance of electronic information exchanges in the daily operation of most large modern organizations is causing them to broaden their security provision to include the custodians of exchanged data - the insiders. The prevailing data loss threat model mainly focuses upon the criminal outsider and mainly regards the insider threat as 'outsiders by proxy', thus shaping the relationship between the worker and workplace in information security policy. A policy that increasingly takes the form of social policy for the information age as it acquires the power to include and exclude sections of society and potentially to re-stratify it? This article draws upon empirical sources to critically explore the insider threat in organizations. It looks at the prevailing threat model before deconstructing 'the insider' into various risk profiles, including the well-meaning insider, before drawing conclusions about what the building blocks of information security policy around the insider might be.

"Bulletproof hosting Autonomous Systems (ASes) malicious ASes fully dedicated to supporting cybercrime provide freedom and resources for a cyber-criminal to operate. Their services include hosting a wide range of illegal content, botnet C&C servers, and other malicious resources. Thousands of new ASes are registered every year, many of which are often used exclusively to facilitate cybercrime. A natural approach to squelching bulletproof hosting ASes is to develop a reputation system that can identify them for takedown by law enforcement and as input to other attack detection systems (e.g., spam filters, botnet detection systems). Unfortunately, current AS reputation systems rely primarily on data-plane monitoring of malicious activity from IP addresses (and thus can only detect malicious ASes after attacks are underway), and are not able to distinguish between malicious and legitimate but abused ASes. As a complement to these systems, in this paper, we explore a fundamentally different approach to establishing AS reputation. We present ASwatch, a system that identifies malicious ASes using exclusively the control-plane (i.e., routing) behavior of ASes. ASwatch's design is based on the intuition that, in an attempt to evade possible detection and remediation efforts, malicious ASes exhibit agile control plane behavior (e.g., short-lived routes, aggressive re-wiring). We evaluate our system on known malicious ASes; our results show that ASwatch detects up to 93% of malicious ASes with a 5% false positive rate, which is reasonable to effectively complement existing defense systems."
E-wallets have started to grow in popularity, reaching a tipping point in some countries. This can be attributed to the worldwide use of payment-enabled devices and ubiquity of e-wallet acceptance by larger and smaller retailers. As more customers adopt e-wallets they may also become a big target of cybercrime. E-wallets facilitates financial transactions via smartphones which is a lucrative opportunity for cybercriminals. This paper presents a security assessment of the Android e-wallet apps of several Canadian leading banks.
Doing business in a network environment, despite its high efficiency, due to the fact that it is a remote activity, is very inspiring for various types of dishonest actions and fraud. Phishing is a form of fraud in which an attacker tries to find out sensitive information such as user login information or account information. The phishing attacks that are happening today are sophisticated and increasingly difficult to spot. To find out which URL is legitimate and which is not, we used a neural network as a binary classifier of machine learning. To measure the performance of the model, we used binary classification accuracy.
Case studies show that there are at least two types of groups involved in phishing: low-tech all-rounders and high-tech specialists. However, empirical criminological research into cybercriminal networks is scarce. This article presents a taxonomy of cybercriminal phishing networks, based on analysis of 18 Dutch police investigations into phishing and banking malware networks. There appears to be greater variety than shown by previous studies. The analyzed networks cannot easily be divided into two sharply defined categories. However, characteristics such as technology use and offender-victim interaction can be used to construct a typology with four overlapping categories: from low-tech attacks with a high degree of direct offender-victim interaction to high-tech attacks without such interaction. Furthermore, clear differences can be distinguished between networks carrying out low-tech attacks and high-tech attacks. Low-tech networks, for example, make no victims in other countries and core members and facilitators generally operate from the same country. High-tech networks, on the contrary, have more international components. Finally, networks with specialists focusing on one type of crime are present in both low-tech and high-tech networks. These specialist networks have more often a local than an international focus.
digital forensic tools are used to unravel criminal acts and prove crime in the court of law. However, the area, task and/or functions digital forensic tools are being applied in may not be suitable hence leading to unreliable results by these tools. In many cases, forensic experts may apply a particular tool not because it is the most effective tool but because it is available, cheap and the expert is familiar with it. This has often led to use of unreliable digital forensic tools, which may yield unreliable results. Unreliable results may jeopardize the whole forensic investigation process and in some cases lead to criminals walking free thereby being bolded to commit the same crime again. This may also lead to time wasting, trial and error, loss of money, etc. In this paper therefore, we quantify the impact of using unreliable digital forensic tools. We analyzed, aggregated, and classified data obtained from Hackmageddon [1] using Bayesian network model. There is a direct link of using unreliable forensic tools to the increase in cyber-crimes. The impact is in billions of dollars lost because of committed crimes with a focus of 5% increase every year.
Criminals have taken advantage of the Internet's features to create worldwide marketplaces where illegal goods and services can be instantly bought and sold anonymously. This article focuses on an online forum that served as a transactional platform for criminals involved in the illicit trade of credit and banking information. Using Gambetta's adaptation of the signalling theory, this research develops a predictive model identifying the signs and signals that can enhance a criminal's performance in this criminal community. Our findings indicate that criminal performance is not distributed randomly. Individuals that are the most skilled at sending and decoding signals can expect to gain higher rewards.
Network investigative techniques (NITs) are law enforcement tools that allow the government to hack into targeted computers by exploiting technological vulnerabilities. NITs have succeeded in identifying and locating criminal actors operating on the Dark Web where traditional investigative techniques have failed. They play a critical role in the investigation of cybercrime and in the national security sphere. But disclosure of a NIT's code can render it useless and jeopardize government operations that rely on that code. In numerous federal cases, criminal defendants have sought access to NIT code, and courts have had to decide whether the government must disclose the code. The government's interest in confidentiality is inherently at tension with criminal defendants' right to discovery and information material to their defense. In order to make informed decisions about disclosure, courts must be cognizant of the equities at stake and understand technical details about NITs. Courts can better equip themselves by holding ex parte and in camera proceedings, and appointing experts to augment their understanding of technical issues. These procedures can ensure that the government is held accountable, defendants' rights are protected, and NIT code is preserved. As the Dark Web expands, cybercrime is likely to become more pervasive, and criminal actors will devise more sophisticated means of anonymizing their presence online. Law enforcement will have to respond creatively and courts must be prepared to tackle novel issues that straddle technology and law.
This study investigates UpWork affordances and their implications for female freelancers experiencing different forms of cyberviolence. Building up on a theoretical framework to situate the concept of affordances, gendered affordances and cyberviolence within a platform economy context, I use UpWork as a relevant case study to assess how online platforms that intermediate labour transactions present gendered affordances contributing to cyberviolence against women. I analysed the discussions of female users and freelancers in UpWork in line with the digital methods approach, by conducting a qualitative digital ethnographic analysis. These discussions serve as a foundation for a subsequent critical analysis of UpWork terms of service, to gain a wider understanding of how the digital platform controls information flows and models interactions between different categories of users. The findings suggest that UpWork affordances are gendered affordances, as they allow male users different conducts, as opposed to female freelancers, entrepreneurs, or users. I conclude that, while UpWork core features are allegedly neutral, they enable gendered affordances widening the gender gap in digital market transactions by facilitating the occurrence of cyber violence against women.
Information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly the internet, have transformed almost every aspect of human life. While most of the breakthroughs in this area have offered great benefits, unintended negative consequences have also resulted. One example of the latter is the surge in illicit drug trafficking using the dark web and other internet-based techniques. Two key reasons for this surge are the anonymity of offenders and the diversity of internet-based trading platforms. Recent developments have shown that cybercriminals have made considerable use of the dark web to expand illicit drug trafficking globally, which has become a source of concern. According to global surveys, a substantial percentage of participants confessed to buying illicit drugs online. Law enforcement agencies are constantly undertaking surveillance operations to track and disrupt mass criminals and prevent crime on the dark web. The closure of major online drug trafficking platforms, on the other hand, has a minimal long-term impact on drug sales on the dark web market because customers and suppliers migrate to other trade platforms and overall sales eventually recover, highlighting the importance of a technologically robust intergovernmental regulatory framework. In this context, this article seeks to address and analyze the following issues: First, we provide an overview of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Second, we explain the methods of purchasing drugs over the dark web. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing the future of the Dark Web and will propose some solutions and recommendations to regulate drug trafficking over the dark web.
In recent times, cybercrime has increased significantly and dramatically. This made the need for Digital Forensics (DF) urgent. The main objective of DF is to keep proof in its original state by identifying, collecting, analyzing, and evaluating digital data to rebuild past acts. The proof of cybercrime can be found inside a computer's system files. This paper investigates the viability of Multilayer perceptron (MLP) in DF application. The proposed method relies on analyzing the file system in a computer to determine if it is tampered by a specific computer program. A dataset describes a set of features of file system activities in a given period. These data are used to train the MLP and build a training model for classification purposes. Identifying the optimal set of MLP parameters (weights and biases) is a challenging matter in training MLPs. Using traditional training algorithms causes stagnation in local minima and slow convergence. This paper proposes a Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) as a trainer for MLP using an optimized set of MLP parameters. SSA has proved its applicability in different applications and obtained promising optimization results. This motivated us to apply SSA in the context of DF to train MLP as it was never used for this purpose before. The results are validated by comparisons with other meta-heuristic algorithms. The SSAMLP-DF is the best algorithm because it achieves the highest accuracy results, minimum error rate, and best convergence scale.
This article investigates if cryptocurrencies returns' are similarly affected by a selection of demand- and supply-side determinants. Homogeneity among cryptocurrencies is tested via a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model where determinants of Bitcoin returns are applied to a sample of 12 cryptocurrencies. The analysis goes beyond existing research by simultaneously covering different periods and design choices of cryptocurrencies. The results show that cryptocurrencies are heterogeneous, apart from some similarities in the impact of technical determinants and cybercrime. The cryptocurrency market displays evidence of substitution effects, and design choices related explain the impact of the determinants of return.
The rapid development of Internet services also led to a significant increase in cyber-attacks. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and automation, make the protections ineffective. Conventional cybersecurity approaches have a limited effect on fighting new cyber threats. Therefore, we need new approaches, and artificial intelligence can aid to counter cybercrime. In this paper, we present the capability of adopting artificial intelligence techniques in cybersecurity and present some of those intelligent-based approaches already in place in practice. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of AI-based approaches in cybersecurity as well as suggest some directions for research in the future.

Developing an unbreakable cryptography is a long-standing question and a global challenge in the internet era. Photonics technologies are at the frontline of research, aiming at providing the ultimate system with capability to end the cybercrime industry by changing the way information is treated and protected now and in the long run. Such a perspective discusses some of the current challenges as well as opportunities that classical and quantum systems open in the field of cryptography as both a field of science and engineering.
In this paper, we propose and experimentally assess an innovative framework for scaling posterior distributions over different-curation datasets, based on Bayesian-Neural-Networks (BNN). Another innovation of our proposed study consists in enhancing the accuracy of the Bayesian classifier via intelligent sampling algorithms. The proposed methodology is relevant in emerging applicative settings, such as provenance detection and analysis and cybercrime. Our contributions are complemented by a comprehensive experimental evaluation and analysis over both static and dynamic image datasets. Derived results confirm the successful application of our proposed methodology to emerging big data analytics settings.
With the rapid growth of malware attacks, more antivirus developers consider deploying machine learning technologies into their productions. Researchers and developers published various machine learning-based detectors with high precision on malware detection in recent years. Although numerous machine learningbased malware detectors are available, they face various machine learning-targeted attacks, including evasion and adversarial attacks. This project explores how and why adversarial examples evade malware detectors, then proposes a randomised chaining method to defend against adversarial malware statically. This research is crucial for working towards combating the pertinent malware cybercrime.
Network forensics known as an extended phase of network security plays an essential role in dealing with cybercrime. The performance of a network forensics system heavily depends on the network attack detection solutions. Two main types of network attacks are network level and application level. Current research methods have improved the detection rate but this is still a challenge. We propose a Shannon entropy approach to this study to identify executable file content for anomaly-based network attack detection in network forensics systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides high detection rate.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications, such as WeChat, Whatsapp, or LINE, have gained increasing popularity during the last few years. Packets analysis of VoIP is one of the critical criminal investigation strategies for law enforcement agencies (LEAs). Due to its convenience and multi-functionality, the WeChat application is accessible by a massive amount of people in Asia, especially in Taiwan and China. Therefore, this study uses Wireshark to reveal the tool marks behind the WeChat messages and voice calls. It will be an excellent help for LEAs to identify cybercriminals and bring them to justice.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies transformed the trade in illegal goods, especially drugs. Thanks to them in conjunction with other anonymization tools could arise dark markets, illegal marketplaces in cyberspace. Despite active intervention by the authorities, their number and quantity of goods on offer is growing significantly. Besides, we observed a tendency to change the structure of the drug market. This article is next to the description of the operation of dark markets based on identified trends and look to the future of how will dark markets look like.............
Financial technology, or Fintech, represents an emerging industry on the global market. With online transactions on the rise, the use of IT for automation of financial services is of increasing importance. Fintech enables institutions to deliver services to customers worldwide on a 24/7 basis. Its services are often easy to access and enable customers to perform transactions in real-time. In fact, advantages such as these make Fintech increasingly popular among clients. However, since Fintech transactions are made up of information, ensuring security becomes a critical issue. Vulnerabilities in such systems leave them exposed to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to clients and providers alike. For this reason, techniques from the area of Machine Learning (ML) are applied to identify anomalies in Fintech applications. They target suspicious activity in financial datasets and generate models in order to anticipate future frauds. We contribute to this important issue and provide an evaluation on anomaly detection methods for this matter. Experiments were conducted on several fraudulent datasets from real-world and synthetic databases, respectively. The obtained results confirm that ML methods contribute to fraud detection with varying success. Therefore, we discuss the effectiveness of the individual methods with regard to the detection rate. In addition, we provide an analysis on the influence of selected features on their performance. Finally, we discuss the impact of the observed results for the security of Fintech applications in the future.
Different types of covert illicit networks in cyberspace hold the potential to become actors in cyber conflicts. Current literature on structures of covert networks in cyberspace is often constrained by the lack of quantitative data and researchers mostly focus on networks operating outside the cyberspace. The purpose of this paper is to review the current state of research into illicit networks in cyberspace and to apply the terminology and concepts of Social Network Analysis on criminal organisations operating online. Social Network Analysis is a quantitative data analysis method, which can identify hierarchies, subgroups, individuals and their relative importance in covert illicit networks, by using data from multiple sources (academic research, law enforcement, black market trading, semantic web analysis etc.). Here I explore how Social Network Analysis offers methods to discover hidden structures of covert networks in cyberspace.
Legal, organizational and technical issues of the current state of crime prevention in the field of electronic payment systems in different countries and in Ukraine are considered. The following methods were used in the article: dialectical, documentary analysis, analytical analysis of documents and observations. Identified and analyzed current trends and risks associated with the use of electronic payment systems by legal entities. Electronic payments have been found to be a progressive and convenient innovation on the one hand, which has greatly accelerated the ability of individuals to engage in day-to-day market relations, and on the other, to be unlawfully encroached upon and systematically improved by criminals Based on this, emphasis is placed on the urgent need for proper protection of payment systems. It is noted that examples of global counteraction to crimes and various offenses committed in the field of electronic payments are developed countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Singapore, as well as the European Union, especially France and Germany. As a result of the study, it has been noted that the above countries have all the opportunities to provide Ukraine and its citizens, as well as government officials with the necessary guidelines, technical and legal assistance to create an effective mechanism to combat offenses in the use of electronic payment systems.
In this paper we revisit a study presented at MILCOM 2014. Our goal then was to determine the utility of implanting a vulnerability into a cybersecurity software protocol to an actor planning to execute an offensive cyber operation. Based on a case study describing the then recently discovered Heartbleed bug as an offensive cyber operation, a model was devised to estimate the adoption rate of an implanted flaw in OpenSSL. Using the adoption rate of the cryptographic protocol Transport Layer Security version 1.2 as a proxy, we predicted that the global adoption of the vulnerability of at least 50% would take approximately three years, while surpassing 75% adoption would take four years. Compared to subsequently collected real-world data, these forecasts turned out to be surprisingly accurate. An evaluation of our proposed model shows that it yields results with a root-mean-square error of only 1.2% over the forecasting period. Thus, it has a significant degree of predictive power. Although the model may not be generalizable to describe the adoption of any software protocol, the finding helps validate our previously drawn conclusion that exploiting implanted cyber vulnerabilities, in a scenario like the one presented, requires a planning horizon of multiple years. However, as society becomes further dependent on the cyber domain, the utility of intentional vulnerability implantation is likely an exercise in diminishing returns. For a defender, however, our model development process could be useful to forecast the time required for flawed protocols to be phased out.
The nature of crime is changing-estimates suggest that at least half of all crime is now committed online. Once everyday objects (e.g. televisions, baby monitors, door locks) that are now internet connected, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), have the potential to transform society, but this increase in connectivity may generate new crime opportunities. Here, we conducted a systematic review to inform understanding of these risks. We identify a number of high-level mechanisms through which offenders may exploit the consumer IoT including profiling, physical access control and the control of device audio/visual outputs. The types of crimes identified that could be facilitated by the IoT were wide ranging and included burglary, stalking, and sex crimes through to state level crimes including political subjugation. Our review suggests that the IoT presents substantial new opportunities for offending and intervention is needed now to prevent an IoT crime harvest.
As Internet freedom movements build infrastructures to promote online privacy, they enrol a wide range of different kinds of of technological work [Coleman, E. G., & Golub, A. (2008). Hacker practice: Moral genres and the cultural articulation of liberalism. Anthropological Theory, 8(3), 255-277]. I explore the cultures of the wider forms of technical work involved in these struggles through a sociological study of the Tor Project, involving twenty-six qualitative interviews with people in the Tor community and extensive archival research in Tor's mailing lists and design documents. Tor is an online privacy infrastructure whose practice of radical transparency makes it uniquely accessible, and it constitutes an example of a successful, widely used infrastructure which directly undermines the centralisation of governmental power online. Tor is not united around a single worldview, instead exhibiting three distinct framings of its work. Using Susan Leigh Star's social worlds framework, I characterise these three 'social worlds' of Tor. I argue that Tor has in the past accommodated its internal clashing perspectives through an ambiguity around politics and a shared construction of the users of Tor, which allow individuals to bridge and translate between these worlds. In recent years, this political ambiguity has become unsustainable. As Internet platforms and infrastructures extend further into social life around the world, so too are they being forced to come to terms with the shaping forces they exert on society and the values they represent. Tor is not exempt from this, and as it navigates these issues it is becoming increasingly mindful of its own relationships to power, values and politics.
The World Wide Web or the internet today is a vast space. It contains information about everything one wants and is accessible at the tip of the finger. Billions of people use the internet every day and most of them at the same time. When we think about the activities taking place on the web, we are bound to think about all the crimes that happen throughout the web. People are exposed to crimes like identity theft, crypto-jacking, cyber extortion, etc. Therefore, their security becomes a serious question and the topmost priority of the creators. Here comes the need for cybersecurity. This paper focuses mainly on the threats faced and the innovations in technology to encounter those threats.
Considerable scholarly attention has been paid to a range of criminal behaviours that are perpetrated with the aid of digital technologies. Much of this focus, however, has been on high-tech computer crimes, such as hacking, online fraud and identity theft, or child exploitation material and cyberbullying. Less attention has been paid to technology-facilitated sexual violence', where new technologies are used as tools to perpetrate or extend the harm of a sexual assault, extend control and abuse in a domestic violence situation, or distribute sexual or intimate images of another without their consent. In this article, we focus on the scope and limitations of criminal legislation for responding to these varied but interconnected gendered harms. We argue that although there have been some developments in a range of international jurisdictions, particularly relating to the phenomenon of revenge pornography', much more needs to be done both within and beyond the law. Whilst we support the intervention of the criminal law, we argue that equal attention must be given to policies and practices of educators, law enforcement agencies, service providers, online communities and social media networks to fulfil the promise of equal and ethical digital citizenship.
In order to combat computer crime effectively, the public security colleges have opened computer forensics course, which was taught by conventional theories teaching method and was not good enough to meet the needs for police personnel training. We provide a process assessment method in reference of the virtues of the flipped classroom and formative assessment, which can mobilizes students to learn actively and improves teaching effectiveness. This paper focuses on the design of the process assessment teaching method and implements process of computer forensics course in a real forensics teaching environment. In contrast to the traditional teaching methods, this process assessment method will engage students to learn abstract concepts and to explore forensics investigation technologies and procedures, and is very important for the cultivation of police talents.
Criminological inquiry has identified a range of risk factors associated with juvenile delinquency. However, little research has assessed juvenile computer hacking, despite the substantial harm and opportunities for delinquent behavior online. Therefore, understanding the applicability of criminological risk factors among a cross-national sample of juvenile hackers is important from a theoretical and applied standpoint. This study aimed to address this gap using a logistic regression and latent class analysis (LCA) of risk factors associated with self-reported hacking behavior in a sample of more than 60,000 juveniles from around the globe. Results demonstrated support for individual- and structural-level predictors of delinquency, although distinct risk factors for hacking among three subtypes are identified in the LCA. This study examines criminological risk factors for juvenile hacking in a cross-national sample and provides insight into the distinct risk factors of hacking, so more tailored prevention and treatment modalities can be developed.
Do drug dealers entice nonusers with free samples? Police, the popular press, and social media users say so, but crime researchers have found little support for this theory and argue instead that sample distribution is an unsound strategy for illegal market business. But what about in digital drug markets, where operational logics are based on sophisticated anonymization technology and reputation systems? The author collected data from a large e-commerce website for drugs over 305 days in 2014 and 2015 and documents that (a) drug dealers give away samples of all major substance categories and (b) sample distribution increases vendor sales for prescription drugs and opioid-based painkillers. To explore possible explanations of these findings, the author collected data from the market's online forum and analyzed 175 discussions (2,218 posts) about samples. Among the findings is that samples are preferably given to reputable review writers, or drug critics.
We propose a systematic framework for analysing forum datasets, which contain minimal structure, and are non-trivial to analyse at scale, aiming to support future analysis of underground forum communities. We use a multi-technique approach which draws on a combination of features, including post classifications extracted using natural language processing tools, and apply clustering and predictive techniques to this dataset, to predict potential key actors-individuals who have a central role in overtly criminal activities, or activities which could lead to later offending, and hence might benefit most from interventions. We predict 49 key actors on an underground gaming-specific cheating and hacking forum, validated by observing only overlaps of techniques, combined with topic analysis, to build a classifier for key actor status. In addition, we also use these techniques to provide further insight of key actor activity. We found one cluster and two posting trajectories to contain a high proportion of key actors, logistic regression found an actor's h-index to have higher odds for prediction than other features, and partial dependence plots found reputation to have a significant change in prediction between values of 100 to 1000.
It is well-documented that during a war, a natural disaster or a pandemic, women bear the worse brunt of the crisis. Worldwide, mental stress, domestic violence and cybercrime against women are widespread and under-reported during Covid-19. Creating boundaries in such situations is extremely important. It is imperative that policy-makers adopt a gender perspective to understand and analyse the effects of the pandemic and the lockdown on the economy, livelihoods and social structures. United Nations has called for urgent action and for governments to put women's safety first as they respond to the pandemic.
Cloud computing is radically changing the way how information technology services are created, delivered, accessed and managed. The rise of cloud computing not only has exacerbated the problem of scale for digital forensics activities, but also created a brand new front for cybercrime investigation with various challenges. Through this paper, we will give a comprehensive perspective in the integrated framework for the design of cloud-based digital forensics labs, along with scenario and procedures. In addition, those hands-on labs will be tested by training future investigators, current students whose career will be in Information Assurance (IA) related fields.
Ponzi schemes that offer absurdly high rates of return by relying on more and more people paying into the scheme have been documented since at least the mid-1800s. Ponzi schemes have shifted online in the Internet age, and some are re-branded as HYIPs or High Yield Investment Programs. This paper focuses on understanding HYIPs' continuous presence and presents various possible reasons behind their existence in today's world. A look into the countries where these schemes purport to exist, we find that 62.89% of all collected HYIPs claim to be in the United Kingdom (UK), and a further 55.56% are officially registered in the UK as a 'limited company' with a registration number provided by the UK Companies House, a UK agency that registers companies. We investigate other factors influencing these schemes, including the HYIPs' social media platforms and payment processors. The lifetime of the HYIPs helps to understand the success/failure of the investment schemes and helps indicate the schemes that could attract more investors. Using Cox proportional regression analysis, we find that having a valid UK address significantly affects the lifetime of an HYIP.
This article explores the growth of the new private security industry and private policing arrangements, policing cyberspace. It argues there has been a significant change in policing which is equivalent to the quiet revolution associated with private policing that Shearing and Stenning observed in the 1970s and 1980s, marking the second quiet revolution. The article then explores some of the regulatory questions that arise from these changes, which have been largely ignored to date by scholars of policing and policy-makers, making some clear recommendations for the future focus of them.
This essay deconstructs the ultra-dark side of social media and explores the variety of 'bad' behaviour online by looking at a wide spectrum of exploitative practices. Through the use of primary data from an online platform, we posit the question What's the worst thing you've done online'? We collect, code and synthesise the fully anonymised discussions and develop a classification model for bad online behaviour. We combine the categories that emerge from our empirical data with those proposed by Baccarella, Wagner, Kietzmann, and McCarthy (2018) and develop a new combined (meta-) classification model that captures both the dark side of social networking and the ultra-dark. A framework is proposed for conceptualising the spectrum of exploitative practices and the essay concludes by providing a series of management considerations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Research exploring the extent and nature of fear of crime has spanned decades; it has been examined in many contexts, among varied populations, and from different theoretical perspectives. However, researchers have been slow to estimate or explain individuals' fear of online crime. The current study is among the first to address this issue by examining experiences from a random sample of undergraduate students enrolled at a large public university. In particular, we explore the links between perceived risk, online victimization, and fear of online interpersonal victimization (OIPV) and how these relationships vary by the victim-offender relationship. The effects of online exposure and demographic characteristics were also estimated. Results suggest that perceived risk of OIPV was significantly related to fear of OIPV for all types of victim-offender relationships, while previous online victimization was significant for fear of OIPV by intimate partners and friends/acquaintances only."
This special issue of the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology intends to expand the examination of victimology and victim issues. The social problem of violence is universal, and there is much to learn from policies and programs that are found to be effective across the globe. The four issues in this special issue span global problems such as cybercrime, interpersonal violence, violent socialization, and the victimization of college students. Solutions to these harms include micro-level programmatic efforts as well as broader social-political efforts.
Cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, Ethereum, and, more recently, Monero has become the currency of choice for many drug dealers and extortionists. The criminal activities extend to tax evasion, money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and the theft of cryptocurrencies to kidnapping for ransom. As the demand for cryptocurrencies increases, it provides opportunities for criminals to hide behind the presumed privacy and anonymity. Identifying these cryptocurrency-related crimes have posed challenges for law enforcement due to the cross-border nature of transactions, the use of evasion technology to mask the identity of users, and inconsistent regulations. To address the role of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities, the study focused on four research questions: (1) What role do cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) play in criminal activities? (2) What factors facilitate cryptocurrency-related criminal activities? (3) What role do politics play in regulating cryptocurrencies? and (4) What are the challenges they pose for regulators and law enforcement? To answer the questions, the study utilized a systematic content review of the news reports, court cases, scholarly articles, online search engines, and commentaries relevant to regulations and reforms. The findings help to understand the current climate of virtual currencies, their use in criminal activities, and the complexities involved in regulating cryptocurrencies.
Well-meaning cybersecurity risk owners will deploy countermeasures (technologies or procedures) to manage risks to their services or systems. In some cases, those countermeasures will produce unintended consequences, which must then be addressed. Unintended consequences can potentially induce harm, adversely affecting user behaviour, user inclusion, or the infrastructure itself (including other services or countermeasures). Here we propose a framework for preemptively identifying unintended harms of risk countermeasures in cybersecurity. The framework identifies a series of unintended harms which go beyond technology alone, to consider the cyberphysical and sociotechnical space: displacement, insecure norms, additional costs, misuse, misclassification, amplification, and disruption. We demonstrate our framework through application to the complex, multi-stakeholder challenges associated with the prevention of cyberbullying as an applied example. Our framework aims to illuminate harmful consequences, not to paralyze decision-making, but so that potential unintended harms can be more thoroughly considered in risk management strategies. The framework can support identification and preemptive planning to identify vulnerable populations and preemptively insulate them from harm. There are opportunities to use the framework in coordinating risk management strategy across stakeholders in complex cyberphysical environments.
Online fraud is ever-increasing with fraudsters who use a variety of platforms, like online employment classified advertisement databases, to defraud unsuspecting users. The literature suggests fraudsters achieve this by imitating legitimate individuals and organizations to deploy their SE characteristics and tactics for the purpose of gaining users' personal, sensitive and financial information for their own personal gain. The research objective of the current study is to explore the extent fraudsters' SE attacks, such as linguistic cues and tactics, differ depending on a user's online resume presentation on employment database websites. The current study uses a mixed methods analysis to quantify the qualitative data extracted from fraudsters who pretend to be legitimate employers/employment opportunities online. The findings suggest an association between unique fraudsters and fraud instances and the demographics of a featured resume profile. Additionally, the results indicate that a fraudster's technological ability and thus sophistication may influence SE characteristics, especially their tactics to defraud targets. The study emphasizes the critical role human behavior plays during an online fraud attack with recommendations for future research and policy. The findings suggest fraudsters socially learn and adapt to their online environment and consequently emphasize the importance of identifying offenders' ever-changing strategies to defraud users while educating potential targets.
Blockchain DNS has emerged as an alternative solution to traditional DNS to address many of its inherent drawbacks. In this regard, a blockchain DNS approach is decentralised, resilient, provides high availability, and prevents censorship. Unfortunately, despite these desirable features, the major blockchain DNS solutions to date, Namecoin and Emercoin have been repeatedly reported for malicious abuse, ranging from malware distribution to phishing. In this work, we perform a longitudinal analysis of both these chains trying to identify and quantify the penetration of malicious actors in their ecosystems. To this end, we apply a haircut blacklisting policy and the intelligence collected from various engines to perform a taint analysis on the metadata existing in these blockchains, aiming to identify malicious acts through the merge of identifying information. Our analysis provides an automated validation methodology that supports the various reports about the wide-scale abuse of these solutions showing that malicious actors have already obtained an alarming and extensive share of these platforms.
The paper deals with the locations of IP addresses that were used in the past. This retrospective geolocation suffers from continuous changes in the Internet space and a limited availability of past IP location databases. I analyse the retrospective geolocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses over five years. An approach is also introduced to handle missing past IP geolocation databases. The results show that it is safe to retrospectively locate IP addresses by a couple of years, but there are differences between IPv4 and IPv6. The described parametric model of location lifetime allows us to estimate the time when the address location changed in the past. The retrospective geolocation of IP addresses has a broad range of applications, including social studies, system analyses, and security investigations. Two longitudinal use cases with the applied results are discussed. The first deals with geotargeted online content. The second deals with identity theft prevention in e-commerce.
As the core evidence in the Internet era, electronic data has been readily incorporated into criminal proceedings. In China, it was not until the Criminal Procedure Law was amended in 2012 that electronic data was classified as an independent type of evidence. Apart from the Criminal Procedure Law, there are three main regulations pertaining to the use of electronic data. Even though great endeavors have been made by Chinese authorities to integrate novel technologies into electronic data and the basic framework for the regulations of electronic data has been formed, there are still some lingering weaknesses in the current regulations: vulnerable rights of criminal suspects, the absence of the special investigation department, unclear provisions in relevant regulations, and improper remedy mechanisms. To further develop the rules of electronic data, China is supposed to place emphasis on the idea of rights protection and the interaction between new technologies and evidence theory.
Research Summary The results of previous research indicate that the presentation of deterring situational stimuli in an attacked computing environment shapes system trespassers' avoiding online behaviors during the progression of a system trespassing event. Nevertheless, none of these studies comprised an investigation of whether the effect of deterring cues influence system trespassers' activities on the system. Moreover, no prior research has been aimed at exploring whether the effect of deterring cues is consistent across different types of system trespassers. We examine whether the effect of situational deterring cues in an attacked computer system influenced the likelihood of system trespassers engaging in active online behaviors on an attacked system, and whether this effect varies based on different levels of administrative privileges taken by system trespassers. By using data from a randomized experiment, we find that a situational deterring cue reduced the probability of system trespassers with fewer privileges on the attacked computer system (nonadministrative users) to enter activity commands. In contrast, the presence of these cues in the attacked system did not affect the probability of system trespassers with the highest level of privileges (administrative users) to enter these commands. Policy Implications In developing policies to curtail malicious online behavior committed by system trespassers, a one-policy-fits-all approach is often employed by information technology (IT) teams to protect their organizations. Our results suggest that although the use of a warning banner is effective in reducing the amount of harmful commands entered into a computer system by nonadministrative users, such a policy is ineffective in deterring trespassers who take over a network with administrative privileges. Accordingly, it is important to recognize that the effectiveness of deterring stimuli in cyberspace is largely dependent on the level of administrative privileges taken by the system trespasser when breaking into the system. These findings present the need for the development and implementation of flexible policies in deterring system trespassers.
Drug cryptomarkets are a significant development in the recent history of illicit drug markets. Dealers and buyers can now finalize transactions with people they have never met, who could be located anywhere across the globe. What factors shape the geography of international drug trafficking via these cryptomarkets? In our current study, we test the determinants of drug trafficking through cryptomarkets by using a mix of social network analysis and a new dataset composed of self-reported transactions. Our findings contribute to existing research by demonstrating that a country's level of technological advancement increases the probability of forming trafficking connections on cryptomarkets. Additionally, we found that a country's capacity to police cryptomarkets reduces the number of trafficking connections with other countries. We also observed that trafficking on cryptomarkets is more likely to occur between countries that are geographically close. In summary, our study highlights the need to consider both online and offline factors in research on cryptomarkets.
In 2011, Silk Road became the first black market, or cryptomarket, for illicit drugs. This study examines two of the largest cryptomarkets which have operated, Silk Road 2.0 and Agora Marketplace. We hypothesize that cryptomarkets cater to buyers who intend to resell or redistribute the products, specifically in the form of social drug dealing, and that larger quantities will be purchased on the cryptomarkets over time. We examine these hypotheses through a descriptive and qualitative assessment of the distribution of drugs sold, and an estimated trend line based on simple linear regression. Data was collected using a custom web crawler which was supplemented with a dataset collected by independent researcher Gwern Branwen, community members and researchers in total spanning the period from February 28th 2014 to April 2015. The observed demand was primarily for quantities intended for personal use or social drug dealing. The majority of sales fell within the lower price ranges, although a significant part of the revenue was generated in price ranges that suggested business-to-business dealing. Furthermore, we found that the sizes of the purchases decreased significantly in both the case of Silk Road 2.0 and Agora Marketplace. The results suggest that cryptomarkets resemble traditional drug markets in terms of the distribution and revenues. As such, it is relevant to include cryptomarkets in discussions about potential reductions of the harmful social consequences of drug markets, as well as in general discussions about drug markets and drug trafficking.
We warned the public more than 20 years ago that cryptoviral extortion would pose a major threat to users, a threat that has been realized with the advent of Bitcoin but largely neglected until recently. We believe that a reactive mindset along with group conformity are partly to blame for this oversight and, moreover, are negatively impacting secure systems research. This presents a recipe for disaster, for while cryptoviral extortion is wreaking havoc on the surface, covert cryptovirology attacks are likely gathering strength within the shadows.
"Attribution of cybercrimes is significant in limiting the rate of crime as well as in preparing the required level of response. Motivated by this significance, we introduce a level-based approach for achieving attribution. In our proposed approach, attribution consists of three steps: (1) identification of the cyberweapon used; (2) determination of the origin of the attack; and (3) identification of the actual attacker. We conduct an in-depth analysis of recently proposed attribution techniques. Our analysis reveals that indirect methods of attribution are particularly effective when attributing cybercrimes; many of them remain unattributed. We also discuss some of the legal issues pertaining to attribution, and we argue that well-defined international laws for cyberspace along with strong cooperation among governments are needed to track down and punish cybercriminals.

The SICH Project specific objective is to develop new strategic tools and assessment techniques, based on semantic analysis on texts, to support the dynamic mapping and the automatic identification of illegal content over the Net. Xenophobia/Racism, illegal online Gambling and Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are the main areas of reference. In this paper the authors present a systems based on a semantic engine running an ontology, based on a criminological analysis of NPS phenomenon. The system, after crawling the web, classifies key elements of NPS crime, not necessarily representing illegal content or criminal activity evidence. Thanks to this approach, the system aims to dramatically reduce the learning time of the key factors of illegal activities, with further reuse of well established web graph and SNA tools to highlight the relevant aspects of the semantic results.
Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of university students with nonconsensual pornography. The focus of the present work is on nonconsensual pornography - the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images and sexual extortion - that are becoming common experiences for many people. While the forms of nonconsensual pornography may vary, each case has one thing in common: the offender has shared a private image of the victim without the victim's consent. Design/methodology/approach The data for this study was collected from student participants at a southeastern university. The stratified sample of university students was sent a link to an online survey and the responses of those who chose to respond were used in subsequent analyses (n = 300). Findings The findings of this exploratory study show low self-control as a significant predictor of sexting. Significant predictors of victimization via nonconsensual pornography included participation in sexting and use of dating apps. Originality/value While not generalizable, the descriptive data provide an important landscape for consideration of policy and legal recommendations to protect potential victims as well as would-be perpetrators beyond a university setting.
Extensive criminological research has investigated the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts to prevent offenders' reoffending and effect changes in criminal behavior patterns. However, no research has quantified the influence of gossip regarding law enforcement operations and its effect on repeat offending. Moreover, only scant research has studied these relationships in the cyber-environment. The current work addresses this gap by studying the effect of online messages sent to active hackers that describe law enforcement efforts against website defacement activity. In two field experiments, we randomly assigned self-identified hackers with active Facebook accounts into control and treatment groups. We then sent subjects in the treatment group a gossip message (via Facebook) alerting them to law enforcement efforts in cyberspace. Following the intervention, we compared the control and treatment groups in terms of changes in the proportion of reoffending, number of website defacements, and severity of website defacements. Findings reveal that when the gossip was sent to a hacker's private inbox, it prompted a reduction in the proportion of hackers who reoffend, the frequency at which they reoffend, and the severity of attacks they generate. However, posting similar gossip on the hacker's Facebook wall was ineffective in restricting malicious hacking activity. Theoretical implications and practical recommendations for law enforcement operations in cyberspace are discussed.
"Romance scams occur when a fraudster adopts a fake online identity to gain a victim's affection and trust and uses the illusion of a romantic or close relationship, eventually to steal money from the victim. Victims of such romance fraud experience suffer both financial and emotional burden. Although multiple studies have offered insight into the correlates of perpetration and victimization, no known study has examined if; and how, romance fraud can be curtailed. The current study used a randomized experimental design to test the restrictive deterrent effect of warning messages sent to romance fraudsters via email. The sample consisted of 405 active email addresses, distributed among three groups: deterrent group, promising group, and ambiguous group. Using the mixed research design, the independent variable was Deterrence; while the dependent variables were Responses, words used by respondents and Seeking Reply Without Denial. The data was analyzed in a stepwise fashion through descriptive statistics, a chi-square test of independence, ANOVA test followed by a tukey kramer pairwise comparison test. The findings revealed that active romance fraudsters who received a deterrence message, instead of non-deterrence messages, responded at a lower rate; and, among those who responded, they used fewer words and had a lower probability of seeking reply without denying wrongdoing. The results provide support for restrictive deterrence in cyberspace. Theoretical and policy implications have also been discussed."
The Dark Web, and the technology which underpins it, is fundamentally changing how crime is conducted. It is an enabler of cross-border, truly international crime where each of the major actors, evidence, and the proceeds of crime can all be in different jurisdictions. The technologies utilised mask the identity of individuals and the nature of the crimes committed. It is these complexities, and law's inability to deal with them, which this paper will focus on. It critically analyses six intersecting and overlapping themes in order to highlight the technological challenges posed by the Dark Web to the criminal law. The paper argues that the current approaches, regulatory structures, legislation and investigative methods are all unfit for purpose. There is little to suggest the law is any closer to restricting Dark Web crime, particularly given a substantial amount of the challenges posed are unsolved traditional issues, in a new form.
In the past 15 years, the development of information technology (IT) is influencing the economic development of the worldwide nations. On the other hand, as more as the day-to-day activities are being transformed by IT, the number of cyber threats will also increase, therefore it is important to handle them. However, handling cyber threats requires a cooperative action to secure nations cyberspace and one key factor is the existence of well-defined organizational structure. This factor plays an important role because it organizes the responsibilities among cyber related entities. Thus, this paper provides a comparative study about cybersecurity efforts and the delegation scheme played by cyber related entities among different entities in two African countries, South Africa and Mozambique. The paper shows that cybersecurity in Mozambique is at its infancy stages unlike South Africa. In addition, the paper presents some recommendations especially for Mozambique to adopt a stronger organizational structure to strengthen its cybersecurity posture to fight against cyber threats and crimes.
Virtual currencies are on the rise and so is money laundering. While there are efforts to combat money laundering through various intergovernmental bodies, many have expressed concern over the rise of virtual currencies. Some cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have played a major role in the proliferation of online money laundering as it possesses characteristics that criminals are fond of. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are decentralised, anonymous/ pseudonymous and irreversible. They provide the means to skirt the Anti-Money laundering safeguards that have been put in place.
In the last few years, a lot of attention has been paid to what is usually called 'ICT Crime'. In this contribution, the term ICT Crime is analysed from both a practical and theoretical legal perspective. It will be argued that it is very difficult if not impossible to define ICT Crime unequivocally. Furthermore, there seems to be insufficient grounds to see ICT criminality as an autonomous legal discipline, as an independent functional discipline or as a specialisation. An important reason for dealing with ICT Crime as if it is a problem area seems to be fear in governmental organisations that new technology could lead to forms of criminality that are outside their reach of control. Furthermore, the application of ICT has led to a reorientation of legal powers with respect to investigation and prosecution. However, these subjects should be dealt with at an international level.

The use of AI software in various fields raises many challenges, especially with regard to the responsibility for the work of these technologies, and the adequacy of applicable regulations and legislation and their ability to accommodate the unique characteristics of this technology. Accordingly, this study aims to address some of the current challenges of artificial intelligence, or those that may arise in the future, especially in light of the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, and the consequent development of the perception that artificial intelligence applications carry out acts that result in crimes, and may carry out these works in the future unilaterally away from the owner or factory, which requires examining the criminal responsibility resulting from these crimes to determine the real responsibility for them and impose a legal sanction on him. The purpose of this study is to codify the status of artificial intelligence crimes, to determine who is responsible for these crimes and the penalties that are imposed on him. The issue raises a basic problem: if artificial intelligence commits a crime, who will be criminally responsible for this crime?, and under this problem there are multiple problems, the most important of which are: granting legal personality to artificial intelligence entities, and the inability of ordinary systems to keep pace with this development.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how COVID-19 may alter the vulnerability levels of older persons, and how this may change their potential for fraud victimisation. This is particularly focused on the government's use of isolation, restrictions on activity and physical distancing to combat the virus. Design/methodology/approach In the absence of statistics, this paper examines what is currently known about older persons and fraud, as well as the recent knowledge of COVID-19-related fraud. On this basis, the paper hypothesises the conceivable changes to vulnerability that potentially expose older persons to fraud. Findings This paper argues that COVID-19 has not seen new fraudulent approaches, rather offenders have used COVID-19 as a context to their existing schemes. Further, the current response to COVID-19 can substantially increase the number of older persons experiencing levels of vulnerability, and therefore increase their fraud risk. Research limitations/implications The current paper applies existing knowledge into the current circumstances of COVID-19 and lays the foundations for empirical work to be conducted in this area. Practical implications This paper provides an impetus to target the well-being and connectivity of older persons, (regardless of the COVID-19 context), to reduce their vulnerability to fraud victimisation. Social implications This paper highlights the importance of connectivity for older persons, and the need to focus on overcoming social isolation and loneliness. Originality/value This paper is the first to hypothesise the effects of COVID-19 and its associated government responses to the overall vulnerability of older persons, with a focus on the potential for fraud victimisation.
Event detection is a cutting-edge problem in video image processing which is not that straight forward to solve. Hence, we perform a thorough search for state of the art in solving the issues in this area. There are many applications of event detection in this age of cybercrime. We target to propose a best solution to outperform existing research and make a positive development in it. We have discussed quite a long list of existing literature reviews in this hope that it would help us and anyone else working on the same as a guideline and one stop reading.
The Iraqi human rights fraternity has opposed the passage of the anti-cybercrime draft law on grounds of its not complying with the Iraqi constitution and the international standards. The controversial bill has been introduced several times since 2011 and it is still not passed. It was alleged that, in the name of preventing cybercrimes, online frauds etc., governments wish to manipulate anti-cybercrime laws to place online and offline restrictions on human rights activists, to cripple the free press and criminalize any kind of promotion of human rights through social media networks. The theoretical underpinnings of this study focus on natural rights, associated with the Greco-Roman concept of natural law, which consider human rights as a privilege of all human beings by virtue of being human This research study adopted a descriptive approach to examine documents, archives and legal cases related to crimes associated with human rights violations. A content analysis approach was adopted to analyze the media reports and archives to retrieve the real cause of the issue. The findings revealed that Iraq is witnessing authoritarianism, civil war, and political deadlocks, in general and the annihilation of human rights, in particular. There have been several instances of human rights violations on the internet and telecommunication. The study recommends to support and nurture online human rights activism, in order to establish a healthy cyber-communications ecosystem. The study also recommends launching a national discussion with relevant individuals and institutions to reformulate the law and eliminate all restrictions that affect freedom of opinion, expression of human rights.
The uptick in malicious activity in cyberspace observed during the initial stage of the coronavirus pandemic highlighted once again the need for addressing cyberattacks. Health-related facilities were some of the main targets of cyber operations, several cyberattacks hitting even COVID-19 hospitals. Cyber operations grew in both intensity and numbers, both regarding cyberattacks and cybercrime. However, alleged state-sponsored cyberattacks are the main focus of this research. Malicious cyber operations set dangerous precedents during the pandemic, and it strengthens the need to adequately address these threats, but also broaden the research, especially in the field of International Relations. The discussion is centred on the most significant cyber incidents during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning with the surge of cyberattacks and cybercrime during the first months of increased dependence on digital technologies for companies and state institutions. Therefore, this paper will start with a literature review regarding cyber operations and IR. Research on cyberspace in IR is not scarce, but it is still lagging behind new and dynamic evolutions. Further, I shall focus on the major state-sponsored cyber operations that occurred during this period, while also paying attention to the problem of attribution. All of these developments regarding cyber operations should stand as significant threats and warnings for governments, private companies, and citizens, and they must be addressed properly in order to prevent future considerable disruptions. Given the above, I shall summarise several general lessons and recommendations that emerged from studying the major state-sponsored cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Phishing is the process of enticing people into visiting fraudulent websites and persuading them to enter their personal information. Number in phishing email are spread with the aim of making web users believe that they are communicating with a trusted entity or organization. Phishing is deployed by the use of advanced and harmful tactics like malicious or phishing URLs. So, it becomes necessary to detect malicious or phishing URLs in the present scenario. Numerous anti-phishing techniques are in vogue to discriminate fake and the authentic website but are not effective. This research, focuses on the relevant URLs features that discriminate between legitimate and malicious/phishing URLs. The impact of email phishing can be largely reduced by adopting an appropriate combination of all these features with classification techniques. Therefore, an Enhanced Malicious URLs Detection (EMUD) model is developed with machine learning techniques for better classification and accurate results .
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought massive online activities and increased cybersecurity incidents and cybercrime. As a result of this, the cyber reputation of organisations has also received increased scrutiny and global attention. Due to increased cybercrime, reputation displaying a more important role within risk management frameworks both within public and private institutions is vital. This study identifies key factors in determining reputational damage to public and private sector institutions through cyberattacks. Researchers conducted an extensive review of the literature, which addresses factors relating to risk management of reputation post-cyber breach. The study identified 42 potential factors, which were then classified using the STAR model. This model is an organisational design framework and was suitable due to its alignment with organisations. A qualitative study using semi-structured and structured questions was conducted with purposively selected cybersecurity experts in both public and private sector institutions. Data obtained from the expert forum were analysed using thematic analysis, which revealed that a commonly accepted definition for cyber reputation was lacking despite the growing use of the term online reputation. In addition, the structured questions data were analysed using relative importance index rankings. The analysis results revealed significant factors in determining reputational damage due to cyberattacks, as well as highlighting reputation factor discrepancies between private and public institutions. Theoretically, this study contributes to the body of knowledge relating to cybersecurity of organisations. Practically, this research is expected to aid organisations to properly position themselves to meet cyber incidents and become more competitive in the post-COVID-19 era.
In this paper, the variance of the seven-minute delete message feature introduced in messaging applications is examined and the possible challenges faced by the forensic investigators has been presented. The aims of this study is to explore the unfavorable of this delete feature introduced by WhatsApp and its consequences on forensic investigation. Furthermore, the study conducts an in-depth exploration regarding technology misuse leading to greater possibilities in cybercrime. For this purpose, the primary data will be analyzed manually. An experiment on a number of WhatsApp artifacts will be conducted to investigate the status of the data after deletion.
The rate of innovation and adoption of information technologies continues to accelerate and each development brings with it unknown side effects and unintended consequences. Cybercrime continues to become smarter and the ubiquity of such technologies together with easy worldwide connectivity means that if only one in a million individuals chooses to act with malicious intent there is a population of 6 million potential attackers. This chapter discusses vulnerabilities that should be considered by decision makers as they could be seen as the soft underbelly of a society that has an irreversible and deep reliance on information technologies.
The mission to move from fossil to renewable energy sources is accompanied and enabled by the digitalization of our energy systems. With the introduction of information and communication technologies, the widespread integration of distributed, renewable sources, even in the distribution grid, are enabled. New use cases such as fast EV charging, local energy communities and dynamic energy tariffs are also enabled. However, this move toward digitalization also increases the exposure of the energy systems for cybercrime and raises concerns regarding the privacy of personal data. In this article, we address the issue of privacy in smart energy systems and give an overview of current methods to enhance privacy.
Owning a SOC is an important status symbol for many organizations. Although the concept of a 'SOC' can be considered a hype, only a few of them are actually effective in counteracting cybercrime and IT abuse. A literature review reveals that there is no standard framework available and no clear scope or vision on SOCs. In most of the papers, specific implementations are described, although often with a commercial purpose. Our research was focused on identifying and defining the generic building blocks for a SOC, to draft a design framework. In addition, a measurement method has been developed to assess the effectiveness of the protection provided by a SOC.
The dark web is often associated with criminal activities such as the sale of exploit kits using cryptocurrencies as payment. However, the difficulty in determining the identities of dark website owners and the tracing of the associated transactions compounds the challenges of investigating dark web activities. In this study, we explore how cryptocurrencies have been involved in cybercriminal activities on the dark web and the factors that drive cryptocurrency investments. Then, we present several recommendations and guidelines for prospective investors to help identify determinant factors for assessing investment risks in the cryptocurrency marketplace. We also present several potential research opportunities in cryptocurrency.
"The increasing demand on privacy is driving a notable quest for privacy legal instruments and practical techniques. The Onion Router (Tor) is considered the most practical service for anonymous public communications; however, it is not yet mainstream despite more than one decade of practical use and research. The reason is referred to using message encryption layers, i.e., onions, via relays offered through unknown volunteers which does not fully protect legitimate users nor services. It can also be used for illegal purposes which hampers its admissibility in many countries. In this paper, we introduce a new ecosystem built on top of Tor to broaden its use by legitimate users and at the same time provide provenance when users violate the usage policy terms. We propose Anonymity Service Providers that provide paid relays as a service to users. A user buys this service from different providers to diversify the onion circuit and avoid collude and thus disclosing her identity. Anonymity is maintained as long as the user abides to the policy; otherwise, her identity is disclosed via a reporting system. This accountability reporting system can be implemented over a Smart Contract to make arbitration automatic. This work proposes new use cases and business opportunities that are worth consideration by both the research and business communities. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."
Banking malware is malicious software that aims to steal money from victims via manipulated bank transfers in online banking. This paper describes how the profits of banking malware are generated and subsequently laundered, with a particular focus on the use of bitcoins and other digital payment methods. Computers are infected with banking malware via phishing emails, in which people are persuaded in various ways to click on links or open attachments, or via exploit kits, programs that try to find weak spots in the security of computer systems. After infection, bank transfers of the online banking accounts of victims are manipulated via fake website screens (web injects). Behind the screens the amounts and beneficiaries of transactions are modified, emptying the victims' bank accounts. In the next step, the banking malware profits are laundered. In this paper we describe two models that are used in particular (next to more traditional money laundering methods). The first model involves the use of money mules and a quick cash-out. The second model focuses on direct spending via (a) direct purchases of products via online shopping, (b) direct purchases of bitcoins via Bitcoin exchanges or (c) direct purchases of luxury goods. Bitcoins can be further laundered via so-called mixing services. All in all, these methods allow criminals to launder profits in relative anonymity and prevent seizure of the illegal profits.
"Terrorists use the Internet for many different reasons; not all are illegal but they do have a terrorist purpose, whether it be for publicity, to commit acts of terror or just for organizational purposes. The inherently transnational nature of this phenomenon poses specific problems to traditional strategies for the prevention, detection and prosecution of terrorist activities online. Countering terrorist use of the Internet demands a collaborative and innovative approach in order to find appropriate security measures while respecting fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression. The potential of the World Wide Web as a weapon in the fight against terrorism must be exploited in a creative and empowering way, attentive to cultural differences and in tune with the concerns, mindsets and worldviews of the specific audiences targeted by terrorist groups."
This research cared about clarifying the legal provisions of the unauthorized access crime contained in article 3 of the Jordanian Cybercrime act of 2015 and comparing it to other Arabic legislations and French law as well as clarifying the position of international conventions on this crime. The analysis of the crime included clarifying its elements, its sanction and the aggravating circumstances of its penalty. At the end of the research we reached some recommendations which we hope from the Jordanian legislator to adopt. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Praeterita praecipiunt. The past teaches.Forensic accounting is a specialization that is projected to grow rapidly, and courses for which are in great demand. While accounting faculty are familiar with cases that could be used to illustrate instances of and investigations into financial statement fraud, the full scope of forensic accounting includes consideration of other crimes and misdeeds. Hence, this article suggests an approach by which students can be introduced to forensic accounting areas such as occupational fraud, corruption, cybercrime, money laundering, the Fraud Triangle, whistle-blowing, and giving testimony, by providing a list of historical cases and resources in various media for the forensic accounting course instructor's use.
Anderson's work on street codes has become a seminal piece in cultural criminology. Today, it is frequently argued that street-oriented cultural beliefs are strongly linked to criminal offending. While numerous studies have found support for this link, research has yet to examine this relationship as it applies to Internet-based criminal behaviors. The current study attempts to fill this gap by examining both the predictors and effect of similar cultural beliefs in the online context. Results indicate that while controlling for more commonly examined predictors of crime, individuals who adhere to street-oriented beliefs in an online context are more likely to commit cybercrime.
PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the potential challenges that governments in the Commonwealth Caribbean are likely to face combating crimes facilitated by the dark Web. Design/methodology/approachThe lived experience methodology guided by a contextual systematic literature review was used to ground the investigation of the research phenomena in the researchers' collective experiences working in, living in and engaging in research with governments in the Commonwealth Caribbean. FindingsThe two major findings emerging from the analysis are that jurisdictional and technical challenges are producing major hindrances to the creation of an efficient and authoritative legislative framework and the building of the capacity of governments in the Commonwealth Caribbean to confront the technicalities that affect systematic efforts to manage problems created by the dark Web. Practical implicationsThe findings indicate the urgency that authorities in the Caribbean region must place on reevaluating their administrative, legislative and investment priorities to emphasize cyber-risk management strategies that will enable their seamless and wholesome integration into this digital world. Originality/valueThe research aids in developing and extending theory and praxis related to the problematization of the dark Web for governments by situating the experiences of Small Island Developing States into the ongoing discourse.
Dark net markets are a competitive environment. As these anonymous markets enable criminals to trade illicit goods or services, this causes vendors to operate under pseudonyms, rather than real-world identities. The constant battle between market admins and law enforcement makes the typical lifespan of a market two years. When a market disappears, active vendors migrate to other markets with the intention to continue their business, or have already pro-actively done so in an effort to ensure business continuity. To secure their reputation across markets, they can try to obtain the same pseudonym on multiple markets, but other individuals could beat them to the punch. A much safer method therefore, is to generate a PGP-key and use the public key as identification across markets. This way, vendors signal their continued trustworthy and reputable service on markets to buyers. In this paper, we leverage the use of PGP-keys to map careers of dark net market vendors. We parse and analyze scraped data from over 90 dark net markets (2011-2015), and discern 2,925 unique careers. By employing group based trajectory modelling, a type of latent class analysis, we infer three different career trajectories - differentiating 'established', 'challenger' and `failed' vendor careers. We show that these trajectories are heavily unbalanced in terms of longevity and success. We find that on average 80% of careers last just four months and generate very little sales. Only a small group (-2%) of highly successful vendors have a long and uninterrupted career that lasts years and spans multiple markets. This group is also responsible for at least 31% of the total revenue in our data.
Over the years, there is an increase in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by digital forensics and cybersecurity professionals to combat cybercrime. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI applications for digital forensics and cybersecurity include data mining, knowledge representation, pattern recognition, and expert systems. This research paper focuses on a literature review of NLP-based systems in digital forensics and cybersecurity: role, applications, challenges, and future directions. This article serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners on the current state of cybersecurity and digital forensics and as well provides a roadmap for the future.
Cyber-security concerns, experiences and protective activities are increasingly discussed not only among specialists but among the general public. There is considerable variability among users, at individual and social level, in the intensity of digital activity, experience of cyber-attacks, preventive measures and concern with security. In this paper we rely on the Eurobarometer 87.4/2017 survey and we classify European Internet users in four attitudinal profiles: the avoiding, the exploratory, the wary and the aware. This empirical classification captures statistical variability and helps build a more nuanced profile of European countries, in order to adapt national policies of awareness to cybercrime.
The approval of the Spanish Organic Law 14/2022, December 22, has modified the Spanish Criminal Code by changing the typical elements of the crime of cyber fraud (redefining its elements and expan-ding its application), and has incorporated non-cash payment mechanisms such as means of commit-ting the crime (which now includes digital payment instruments). In a digital market economy like the current one, it is necessary to adapt Criminal Law to be able to punish these criminal behaviors, which use information technology to commit crimes. This paper analyzes the incidence of these modifica-tions, based on the study of the supranational regulations that have promoted these reforms, from the international level and also from the European Union.
"An electronic payment system is a system of settlements between different organizations and Internet users when buying or selling goods or services over the Internet. The relevance of the research topic is that electronic payment systems are used widely at the present stage of the development of society. This area has not escaped criminal activity. Penalties for digital payment systems and cryptocurrencies should be commensurate with the level of damage caused. The article analyzes the international legal establishing liability for this type of crime. At the instant, it remains an open question for further study of the legal status of cryptocurrency in different countries and the settlement of penalties for violations in the field of digital payment systems and cryptocurrency. Research methods: comparison, observation, analysis, synthesis, analogy, the system method, generalization method, and formal-legal method. According to the results of the study, the international comparative aspect of the types of liability for offenses in the field of digital payment systems was analyzed; the issue of criminal liability for offenses in the field of digital payment systems and cryptocurrencies, as a key punishment for these actions; identified means of protection of payment systems; the issue of legal regulation of cryptocurrency in different countries."
Case-law developments in the United States have supported narrower interpretations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 1986 (CFAA) in cases of unauthorised use of authorised access. This issue has been one that UK courts have also debated in the past and thus this renewed interest in the concept of insider unauthorised access offers an opportunity to bring this debate to the fore again. Starting from discussing the recent US case law, this paper further analyses relevant UK precedent and identifies legal provisions that are applicable when dealing with such incidents in addition to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. More particularly, it identifies provisions, mainly in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Fraud Act 2006, which could substitute for the Computer Misuse Act 1990 in prosecuting insiders and thus clarifies the extent of the prosecutors' legal arsenal and manoeuvring space when dealing with exceeding unauthorised access.

In this opinion piece, we present a synopsis of our findings from the last 2 years concerning cyber-attacks on web-based academia. We also present some of problems that we have faced and try to resolve any misunderstandings about our work. We are academic information security specialists, not hackers. Finally, we present a brief overview of our methods for detecting cyber fraud in an attempt to present general guidelines for researchers who would like to continue our work. We believe that our work is necessary for protecting the integrity of scholarly publishing against emerging cybercrime.
There is a large number of high-profile cyberattacks identified in the year of 2017, i.e., Ransomware attacks are one of the areas of cybercrime growing the fastest. These increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks are forcing various organisations to face security challenges and invest money building security and trust models. There will also be an increase in the use of recent development of security solutions that can help improve the detection performance and react to malicious events. In this position paper, we mainly introduce recent development trends in cybersecurity, including legal issues (e.g., GDPR), Artificial intelligence (AI), Mobile security and Internet of Things.
One of the critical success factors of the cybercrime investigation is exact tracing back of hacker's origin. However, criminals can easily modify or delete log files on victim machines. In addition, criminals can easily modify the source IP address so that network packet cannot be a strong evidence because it is easily spoofed. This study suggests a scheme for network forensic evidence generation and verification. This proposed scheme can show the attacker's source location and guarantee the integrity of address fields. This scheme also can minimize the performance degradation of routers when generating forensic evidence via flow-based evidence traffic analysis.
Switched telephone networks are a key and ubiquitous infrastructure. Recent technological advances have integrated modern and inexpensive systems into these networks in order to use the Internet to place calls via Voice over IP (VoIP). The evolution of this technology has also led to an increase in the number and sophistication of the techniques used by criminals to commit fraud. Specifically, with the emergence of VoIP, attackers can now adapt tools commonly used by cybercriminals, such as botnets, to make their attacks more complex and insidious. For example, through bots they can dial multiple numbers automatically, enabling them to target a greater number of victims, and do so more quickly. While recent studies have shed light on how certain parts of this ecosystem work, it is still unclear how attacks on VoIP systems contribute to this type of fraud. This paper presents a novel VoIP honeypot that captures voice interactions, in addition to employing low-level telemetry. With the study of how attackers obtain access to our honeypot and the actions they perform, we present an overview of the most prevalent types of fraud used in this ecosystem, including unique insights into the origin of the attacks and the destination of calls made through our architecture. Finally, we analyze in depth the actions taken to study the different types of telephony fraud.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The process of digitalization has impacted various aspects of social life, and the growth of digital technologies has led to significant changes in communication in society. During the pandemic, digitalization has been particularly noticeable as it has enabled continuous communication despite restrictions. However, this has also affected the level of crime, and it is crucial to understand how digitalization has impacted crime rates globally. This study aims to investigate the specifics of digitalization's impact on crime during the pandemic, examining the causal relationship between the two. The research focuses on the social relations comprised during digitalization in the criminal legal aspect. Findings suggest that the pandemic has revolutionized the usual law and order among the population, affecting both law-abiding citizens and criminals. Digitalization has also changed the nature of certain crimes, leading to a shift in the level of crime. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to impact society and crime rates for an extended period. Therefore, it is vital to consider the impact of innovative information technologies on crime levels when implementing measures in Ukraine and globally.
This article examines the implications of advanced manufacturing technology, more commonly known as three dimensional (3D) printing, for policing and crime, notably the dissemination of digital design files and the use of 3D printers to produce illicit firearms. The application and rapid evolution of 3D printing technology has created new challenges for law and regulation, and represents an interesting security paradox, albeit one which until now has received scant attention in the criminological or policing literature. On the one hand, 3D printing denotes a significant shift in the creation and use of objects, ranging from food to body parts, and more controversially, weaponry. On the other hand, the use of this technology to create items such as firearms and weapons signifies a potential safety, security, and legal challenge. We explore the emergence of 3D printing and its use to create firearms along with the theoretical challenges to legal design and enforcement presented by this decentralised technology. We also present some empirical data on instances of 3D printed firearms and firearm parts being detected internationally, and some jurisdictions' legal and policy responses. We conclude by considering that any regulation of 3D printed firearms must be based on a robust evidence base and take proper account of citizens' rights, but also that any national regulation will be in tension with the transnational and decentralised nature of the technology.
This paper presents analytical models for optimizing firm's cybersecurity spending and cyber insurance based on the effectiveness of spending in reducing cyber threats, vulnerability and impact, respectively. At the macro-level, the paper shows how private-sector contribution toward countering cybercrimes can reduce the overall cyber loss and create economic value. At the micro level, a firm's effectiveness of security spending in addressing specific cyber threats can be reduced when other co-dependent security measures are not put in place. The paper derives an optimal mix of cybersecurity investments in knowledge and expertise versus deploying mitigation measures. The paper proposes customizing cyber insurance for firms with itemized threat-specific coverage with a portion of the premium used to help clients with risk knowledge and nudge clients in implementing risk mitigation measures. Small and Mid-sized Enterprises can stand benefit the most from such innovative cyber insurance.
Rapid grow of internet users as a result of widely open access significantly contributes to increasing criminal cases particularly child pornography. Internet becomes a convenient place for users to commit distant crime by accessing porn images or child photographs as well as child sexual activity. Meanwhile, current methods to prevent and solve are considered ineffective and conventional. This paper discloses the increasing number of child pornography and provides solution to overcome it. It applied juridical, normative, empirical and technological methods. The results show that it is a tough task for law enforcement officials to find, detect and put the child pornography offenders in prison. The given law is too child-oriented, that is, it contradicts imprisonment concept to put children in jail. Thus, other form of imprisonment is needed including limited access, prohibition and access supervision for the perpretators. Yet, a question follows: who will supervise the access? A set of regulation is then seemingly required. Technology utilization expectedly can contribute to prevent child pornography in terms of software, filter or detector. Considering technology failure few years ago, technology advancement need maintaining to block creativity of cyberchild pornography to hack the information system to reach their goal.
While online offending has been found to be a specialized phenomenon, most literature on criminality indicates that offending behavior over the life course is of a general nature, which is consistent with Gottfredson and Hirschi's general theory of crime. Utilizing data collected from a large sample of 502 undergraduate college students, this study examined the extent to which college students commit off-line offending as compared with online offending. Results from a series of bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated support for conceptualizing online offending as part of a more general offending repertoire rather than as a specialty. Detailed findings, study limitations, and implications for both criminal career research and the specialization debate are also discussed.
The rapid proliferation of information and communications technologies has improved the means to record and transmit information. Not surprisingly, this digitized information can be exploited, corrupted, denied or destroyed electronically, resulting in digital information warfare (DIW). This article examines politically motivated cyberattacks in Eurasia to conduct DINV trend analyses. Document analysis is conducted on 86 documents dated from 1995 to 2011. The article goes beyond traditional DIW research on criminal organization and attack complexity by adding four new DIW components: division of labor, alliances, communication and physical elements. It generates a discussion of whether any of these components are connected, more prominent or exhibits a temporal order. The article also examines several factors that sustain and promote DIW, discusses practical lessons that can be learned from DIW in Eurasia, and offers suggestions for further research.
The objective of the article was to reveal r the main topics related to the definition of hybrid warfare and legal policy of the state in a hybrid war, legal policy of the state in the field of cybersecurity. The need to finalize legislation on the Internet taking into account international human rights standards was emphasized. Given the categorical uncertainty and unwillingness of Ukraine's current legal framework to resist new threats in a hybrid war, it is advisable to terminologize and standardize the conceptual apparatus in the legal system of cybersecurity, harmonize national legislation with international acts, as well as promoteflexibility in relevant areas of activity. It is alsonecessary to legally regulate the use of the Internet to help increase the liability of providers and site owners for the location of inaccurate and deliberately harmful information, as well as to establish a mechanism to influence unscrupulous subjects of information law in cyberspace. It is concluded that a separate area in criminology should be the protection of information sources and information security issues in a hybrid war.
Memory forensics is also known as memory analysis, which deals with the estimation of the changeable data in a system memory repository. In order to investigate and detect the attacks, the professionals perform the memory forensics to interpret the nature of the malware i.e. do not easily traceable on hard drive data. Due to the daily advancement in technological landscape the memory forensic mechanism is emerging trends because the nature of the attacks changing drastically. The general developed defense mechanisms such as anti-malware are not enough capable to deal with the computer threats. Therefore, the latest defense mechanism is directly embedded into the physical memory like RAM and opens the valuable scope of the memory forensic. From last a few decades, the technology and cybercrimes parallelly growing drastically. There are multiple reasons to perform the cyber attacks such as theft and harm the sensitive military data, targeting to ruin the energy system, identity theft of trade secrets, and cyber defamation. Memory-based forensic techniques are becoming very instrumental in digital investigations. This objective of this paper is to help and make it easy to understand the investigator in the process of the developing tools and techniques by considering different aspects of memory analysis and investigation.

Based on lifestyle exposure theory (LET), this study examined online dating application (ODA) use and victimization experiences among adolescents using large cross-national samples of Finnish, American, Spanish, and South Korean young people between ages 15 and 18. According to logistic regression analyses in two substudies, ODA use was associated with more likely victimization to online harassment, online sexual harassment, and other cybercrimes and sexual victimization by adults and peers. According to mediation analyses, this relationship was mainly accounted for by the fact that ODA users engage in more risky activities in online communication and information sharing. Attention should be paid to the risks ODAs pose to vulnerable groups, such as young people, with insufficient skills to regulate their social relationships online.
With the rapid development of the Internet, cybersecurity situation is becoming more and more complex. At present, surface web and dark web contain numerous underground forums or markets, which play an important role in cybercrime ecosystem. Therefore, cybersecurity researchers usually focus on hacker-centered research on cybercrime, trying to find key hackers and extract credible cyber threat intelligence from them. The data scale of underground forums is tremendous and key hackers only represent a small fraction of underground forum users. It takes a lot of time as well as expertise to manually analyze key hackers. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a method or tool to automatically analyze underground forums and identify key hackers involved. In this work, we present HackerRank, an automatic method for identifying key hackers. HackerRank combines the advantages of content analysis and social network analysis. First, comprehensive evaluations and topic preferences are extracted separately using content analysis. Then, it uses an improved Topic-specific PageRank to combine the results of content analysis with social network analysis. Finally, HackerRank obtains users' ranking, with higher-ranked users being considered as key hackers. To demonstrate the validity of proposed method, we applied HackerRank to five different underground forums separately. Compared to using social network analysis and content analysis alone, HackerRank increases the coverage rate of five underground forums by 3.14% and 16.19% on average. In addition, we performed a manual analysis of identified key hackers. The results prove that the method is effective in identifying key hackers in underground forums.
In cybercrime, the evaluation results of the weight of digital evidence are directly influencing the cognizance of the relevant case, further influencing the judgment of the case. Now, it lacks a universally accepted standard to evaluate the weight of digital evidence. Furthermore, the result of the evaluation will be easily influenced by experts. A system, which is based on Naive Bayesian Classification, of digital evidence evaluation is put forward in this paper. It can help normalize the evaluation process effectively and automatically, avoid manual intervention, and then provide reliable evaluation results for the judge's judgment.
Advancements in Information Technology landscape over the past two decades have made the collection, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence an extremely important tool for solving cybercrimes and preparing court cases. Digital evidence plays an important role in cybercrime investigation, as it is used to link individuals with criminal activities. Thus it is of utmost importance to guarantee integrity, authenticity, and auditability of digital evidence as it moves along different levels of hierarchy in the chain of custody during cybercrime investigation. Modern day technology is more advanced in terms of portability and power. A huge amount of information is generated by billions of devices connected to the internet that needs to be stored and accessed, thus posing great challenges in maintaining the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence for its admissibility in the court of law. Handling digital evidences poses unique challenges because of the fact they are latent, volatile, fragile, can cross jurisdictional borders quickly and easily and in many cases can be time/machine dependent too. Thus guaranteeing the authenticity and legality of processes and procedures used to gather and transfer the evidence in a digital society is a real challenge. Blockchain technology's capability of enabling comprehensive view of transactions (events/actions) back to origination provides enormous promise for the forensic community. In this research we proposed Forensic-Chain: A Blockchain based Digital Forensics Chain of Custody, bringing integrity and tamper resistance to digital forensics chain of custody. We also provided Proof of Concept in Hyperledger Composer and evaluated its performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Phishing is a well-known cybercrime. It is performed using various tricks and techniques including email spoofing, exploiting browser vulnerabilities, web spoofing, DNS poisoning, etc. This paper sheds light on a new technique that can be used by attackers to perform a successful phishing attack through malicious browser extensions. Successful experiments have been performed over the Google Chrome browser and the technique has been validated. This paper will help researchers and browser development companies to understand this specific phishing attack and to focus on research in the area of detection and mitigation of this phishing attack.
Romance fraud occurs when an offender uses the guise of a genuine relationship to defraud an individual for financial gain. Known statistics indicate that millions are lost each year to this form of fraud. However, the potential for romance fraud victims to also experience identity crime as a consequence of their interactions and communications with an offender has yet to be explored. This article begins to address this gap by examining the potential exposure for identity crime in the context of romance fraud using reports lodged with Scamwatch, an Australian online fraud reporting portal. The findings demonstrate few behavioural and demographic characteristics associated with the potential exposure of those targeted by romance fraud to identity crime. However, the article provides insights into how this analysis should inform prevention messaging and victim support services for those targeted by romance fraud.
The home network share the data with each other to configure a network after connecting many devices that wired or wireless in the home. Recently the home network has increased as internet of things service extension. But this is not achieved strong security because due to this, each device has the function deterioration problem in home network. Therefore it is necessary to determine the wired or wireless network security vulnerabilities and countermeasures to prevention for cybercrime privacy leakage. In this paper analyzes the factors of home network vulnerabilities and middleware security in internet of things. Also it presents a security vulnerability improvement.
The cybersecurity business report (2018) estimates that cybercrime damage costs will hit $6 trillion annually by 2021 which is an upward trend from $3 trillion in 2015. Resources are being invested in training and understanding the human factors that contribute to these crimes to help deter them. However, most of the research has focused primarily on the Caucasian population with African Americans and other minorities being overlooked. This study focused on the psychosocial characteristics of this under-represented segment of the population in cybersecurity research. The results support past research on the relationship between the demographic variables and cybersecurity victimization but shed new light on these relationships in the minority population.
Smartphones and Internet have become prevalent in our society with various applications in businesses, education, healthcare, gaming, and research. One of the major issues with the Internet today is its lack of security since an eavesdropper can potentially intercept the communication. This has contributed towards an increased number of cyber-crime incidents, resulting in an increase in users' consciousness about the security and privacy of their communication. One example is the shift towards using private browsers such as Tor. Tor is a well-recognized and widely used privacy browser based on The Onion Router network that provisions anonymity over the insecure Internet. This functionality of Tor has been a major hurdle in cybercrime investigations due to the complex nature of its anonymity. This paper investigates artifacts from the Tor privacy browser on the latest Windows 10 and Android 10 devices to determine potential areas where evidence can be found. We examine the registry, storage, and memory of Windows 10 devices and the memory, storage, logs, and Zram of Android 10 devices for three possible scenarios i.e. before, during, and after use of the Tor browser. Our results do not support the claims made by the Tor Project regarding user privacy and anonymity. We find that it is possible to retrieve significant details about a user's browsing activities while the Tor browser is in use as well as after it is closed (on both operating systems). This paper also provides an investigative methodology for the acquisition and analysis of Tor browser artifacts from different areas of the targeted operating systems. Therefore, it can serve as a base to expand research in the forensic analysis of other privacy browsers and improve the efficiency of cybercrime investigations efficiency.
In criminal investigation, the ability to verify the identity of an individual (e.g., suspect or witness) is crucial. However, evidence including personal data can potentially infringe the individual's privacy. To avoid privacy infringement, data collectors in investigative agencies are required to have approval to access personal data from data subjects, but it is hard to check personal data policies of various data subjects. It is necessary to establish a centralized system to control personal data policies. In this paper, we propose the personal data control center to avoid to infringe privacy for data collectors during investigation. This article is categorized under: Digital and Multimedia Science > Cybercrime Investigation
"The connection of home electronic devices to the internet allows remote control of physical devices and involves the collection of large volumes of data. With the increase in the uptake of Internet-of-Things home devices, it becomes critical to understand the digital harms of smart homes. We present a systematic literature review on the security and privacy harms of smart homes. PRISMA methodology is used to systematically review 63 studies published between January 2011 and October 2021; and a review of known cases is undertaken to illustrate the literature review findings with real-world scenarios. Published literature identifies that smart homes may pose threats to confidentiality (unwanted release of information), authentication (sensing information being falsified) and unauthorised access to system controls. Most existing studies focus on privacy intrusions as a prevalent form of harm against smart homes. Other types of harms that are less common in the literature include hacking, malware and DoS attacks. Digital harms, and data associated with these harms, may vary extensively across smart devices. Most studies propose technical measures to mitigate digital harms, while fewer consider social prevention mechanisms. We also identify salient gaps in research, and argue that these should be addressed in future crossdisciplinary research initiatives."
In illicit online markets, actors are pseudonymous, legal institutions are absent, and predation is ripe. The literature proposes that problems of trust are solved by reputation systems, social ties, and administrative governance, but these are often measured independently or in single platforms. This study takes an eclectic approach, conceiving of trust as an estimate informed by any available evidence. Using transaction size as a proxy for trust I estimate the association between competing sources of trust - mediation, reputation, authentication, and social ties - and transaction value using multilevel regression. Using data from two online drug markets, I find mixed evidence that reputation and authentication are associated with transaction value, whereas results are consistent for social ties. Furthermore, transactions outside the scope of administrative mediation are generally larger. These findings have implications for future research and suggest increased attention should be given to the role of mediation practices and social ties.
Cyberspace creates opportunities for new forms of crime that may be related to specific personality characteristics of offenders. Few studies have investigated the personality characteristics of cyber offenders. We address this gap by comparing a judicial sample of 261 suspects of cyber-dependent crime, 260 suspects of offline crime, and a community sample of 512 participants on the HEXACO personality domains and their underlying facets. This provides a nuanced picture of the cybercriminal personality and could provide information for prevention and intervention programs. Results indicate that, compared to suspects of offline crime, suspected cyber offenders score significantly lower on extraversion and significantly higher on conscientiousness and openness to experience. Cyber offenders are more similar to community participants on these main personality domains. With regard to the underlying facets, suspected cyber offenders appear to be unique in their relatively high level of diligence. They are more similar to suspected offline offenders on traits that may help them perform criminal activities, such as lower levels of modesty, fearfulness, and flexibility. They are more similar to the community sample, however, on traits that may strengthen their ability or tendency to commit cyber offenses, such as higher levels of patience, perfectionism, and prudence.
Presently, as Covid 19 has caused most of educational processes to move online, cybersecurity and data protection is rapidly gaining importance in all educational institutions, and most of the academia became more vulnerable to cyberattacks. This article sheds some light on how communities of higher education institutions perceive increased online threats, what measures they take to protect themselves against cybercrime, whether they practice good security hygiene. This paper presents and analyses results of a survey conducted at higher education institutions (universities, colleges) into perception of cybersecurity, online culture and hygiene during the present times of remote education.
Terrorist organizations increasingly resort to the Internet to promote terrorism, recruit new terrorists, plan and finance their operations. The paper first proposes a definition of terrorism, cyberterrorism, and online terrorism preparatory acts. It then analyses whether current binding international instruments on terrorism, organized crime or cybercrime could prohibit cyber activities precursor of terrorism. The paper concludes that there is no gap in international law that leaves online terrorism related acts completely unregulated. It nevertheless recommends the drafting of an international treaty that would respond more comprehensively, precisely and thus efficiently to the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes.
In the last few years, there has been an increase in the use of Web defacements, where individuals post political or ideological messages on websites in place of the original content. There is generally little research on the predictors of Web defacements against either domestic or foreign targets. This study addresses this gap by examining the attitudinal and behavioral correlates of willingness to engage in defacements using a sample of university students in Taiwan and the United States. The findings demonstrate that political attitudes toward marginalized groups and support for cybercrime increase individuals' willingness to engage in defacements.
This article presents an initiative that addresses the problem of the digital literacy generational gap, targeting older adults that struggle to integrate the digital world and are unaware of the dangers of the online environment. The article has a European scope but with a special attention to the Portuguese context. The methodological approach started with a theoretical research on digital and online literacy of adults, followed by the design of an innovative training program specifically designed for this target group and finished with the results of the evaluation of the impact of the training. The overall conclusion, based on the achieved results, leads us to think that it is possible to improve the digital literacy of older adults so that they become effective online users while being alert to the dangers of the online world. Therefore, the work conducted is expected to contribute to a greater awareness of the importance and socio-economic possibilities that arise from the digital and technological investment for stimulating the integration of the older generation in the digital context.
Stemming the illegal trade of endangered species is a critical and very difficult challenge for conservationists and law enforcement. Much effort is given to stopping the trade of charismatic megafauna such as tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses. Endangered plant species, however, receive far less attention and fewer resources, resulting in devastating consequences. Plant species continue to go extinct due to illegal harvesting and selling, while just one order of plants, Orchidales, makes up more than 70% of all threatened wildlife species. This study examines the role the Internet plays in critically endangered plant transactions. Rather than focusing on the dark web for these sales, I search the e-commerce site eBay to better understand the extent to which these trades take place in plain sight. Of the 193 critically endangered plant species examined, 56 were for sale in some form on eBay during the study period. These results indicate a high degree of trading in these species, but do not necessarily indicate criminality. The complexity of the international legal frameworks regulating these transactions makes it difficult to ascertain their legality, but certain indicators point to at least a subset of these sales being unlawful. E-commerce sites like eBay must take more proactive measures to regulate sales and protect these species on the brink, for it is clear the surface web is playing an understudied and important role in fostering these cybercrimes. In sum, the dark web is unnecessary when the surface web is convenient, widely available, and scarcely policed.
This chapter discusses current possibilities of creating transmedia narratives based on various digital media. It thoroughly examines Netwars - out of control, a transmedia narrative project composed of a documentary film, an interactive web documentary/portal, a mobile application, e-books, audio books, and a TV series. The project is centered around technology-based socio-cultural phenomena: user privacy, cybercrime, and hacking. Drawing on the theories formulated by Lev Manovich, Henry Jenkins, and Marie-Laure Ryan, the chapter focuses particularly on providing an account of the project's interactive components and analyzing their medium-specific technological properties, storytelling techniques, and user-engaging models.
The growing demand for computer security, and the cyberization trend, are hallmarks of the 21st century. The rise in cyber-crime, digital currency, and e-governance has been well met by a corresponding recent jump in investment in new technology for securing computers around the globe. Business and government sectors have begun to focus effort on comprehensive cyber security solutions. With this effort has emerged a need for greater collaboration between research and industry fields. Despite much effort, there is still too little cross-disciplinary collaboration in the realm of computer security. This paper reviews the new trends, contributions, and identifiable limitations in cyber security research. We argue that these limitations are due largely to the lack of interdisciplinary cooperation required to address a problem that is clearly multifaceted. We then identify a need for further refinement of standard cyber security terminology to facilitate interdisciplinary cooperation, and propose guidelines for the global Internet multistakeholder community to consider when crafting such standards. We also assess the viability of some specific jargon, including whether cyber should be a separate word when used as a descriptor (e.g. cybercrime or cybercrime), and conclude with recommendations for terminology use when writing papers on cyber security or the new broader field of all things relating to cyberspace, which has recently been dubbed Cybermatics, a term we also examine and propose alternatives to. By furthering the effort to standardize cyber security terminology, this paper lays groundwork for cross-disciplinary collaboration, interaction between technical and nontechnical stakeholders, and drafting of universal Internet governance laws.
Theories of crime have been an important part of criminological literature for many years. Different theories address the issue of crime at various levels, ranging from societal, through community and socialisation influence theories, to the most specific level, individual theories. The aim of most of the theories of crime is to explain why crime occurs and who is most likely to engage in criminal acts, and as such they are an important element of developing a thorough understanding of the psychology of cybercrime. Many of the high level theories of crime are mainly sociological, geographical or political in scope, whereas theories of crime that consider socialisation and individual differences are those which are most suited to psychological discussion. Because of this, the current chapter will primarily focus on these types of theories of crime, although reference will be made to higher level theories as appropriate. Some of the theories of crime considered in this chapter include biological theories, labelling theories, geographical and routine activity theories, trait theories learning theories, psychoanalytic theories, addiction and arousal theories and neutralization theories, as well as examining the complex theory of crime proposed by Eysenck and the complicated issue of defining crime due to its existence as a social construct. While it must be remembered that there has been little empirical examination of how these theories specifically relate to cybercrime, some theories show potential for explaining the nature of the phenomenon. This chapter aims to determine which theories are most suitable for further investigation and applicability to cybercriminal cases.
This paper tests disruption strategies in Twitter networks containing malicious URLs used in drive-by download attacks. Cybercriminals use popular events that attract a large number of Twitter users to infect and propagate malware by using trending hashtags and creating misleading tweets to lure users to malicious webpages. Due to Twitter's 280 character restriction and automatic shortening of URLs, it is particularly susceptible to the propagation of malware involved in drive-by download attacks. Considering the number of online users and the network formed by retweeting a tweet, a cybercriminal can infect millions of users in a short period. Policymakers and researchers have struggled to develop an efficient network disruption strategy to stop malware propagation effectively. We define an efficient strategy as one that considers network topology and dependency on network resilience, where resilience is the ability of the network to continue to disseminate information even when users are removed from it. One of the challenges faced while curbing malware propagation on online social platforms is understanding the cybercriminal network spreading the malware. Combining computational modelling and social network analysis, we identify the most effective strategy for disrupting networks of malicious URLs. Our results emphasise the importance of specific network disruption parameters such as network and emotion features, which have proved to be more effective in disrupting malicious networks compared to random strategies. In conclusion, disruption strategies force cybercriminal networks to become more vulnerable by strategically removing malicious users, which causes successful network disruption to become a long-term effort.
Online fraud is ever-increasing with fraudsters who use a variety of platforms, like online employment classified advertisement databases, to defraud unsuspecting users. The literature suggests fraudsters achieve this by imitating legitimate individuals and organizations to deploy their SE characteristics and tactics for the purpose of gaining users' personal, sensitive and financial information for their own personal gain. The research objective of the current study is to explore the extent fraudsters' SE attacks, such as linguistic cues and tactics, differ depending on a user's online resume presentation on employment database websites. The current study uses a mixed methods analysis to quantify the qualitative data extracted from fraudsters who pretend to be legitimate employers/employment opportunities online. The findings suggest an association between unique fraudsters and fraud instances and the demographics of a featured resume profile. Additionally, the results indicate that a fraudster's technological ability and thus sophistication may influence SE characteristics, especially their tactics to defraud targets. The study emphasizes the critical role human behavior plays during an online fraud attack with recommendations for future research and policy. The findings suggest fraudsters socially learn and adapt to their online environment and consequently emphasize the importance of identifying offenders' ever-changing strategies to defraud users while educating potential targets.
In this study, we contributed on research of policing cyberspace by analysing how different stakeholder groups (nodal clusters) participate in the formal security network during detecting and handling of data system break-ins in practice. The goal of this article was to study whether citizens have roles within the security network. The analysis was based on data system break-ins (n = 220) reported to the Finnish national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI, in 2012. We detected five types of nodal clusters: computer emergency response teams (CERTs), companies, public organisations, private persons and associations. The roles of nodal clusters were described by using cultural, social, political, economic and symbolic capital. However, the results show that there are differences not only between the nodal clusters but also inside them regarding their positioning within the network. We argue that instead of a type of nodal cluster, division based on the roles and individual needs could be more relevant. Recognition of roles could encourage netizens to co-produce cybersecurity from their respective premises.
It is obvious that Computer networks are plagued by Internet worms during last years. These worms has bad influence on the quality of internet services. Better development of worms filters is based on a complete vision of its behavior and methods of its spread. Moreover, reactions to attempted infections may slow down the highly infection rate of internet worms. Different factors affect the spread rate of internet worms such as the underlying transport protocol (TCP or UDP) which creates a distinct difference in propagation of worms from a network's point of view. In this study, different internet worms and factors that affect their infection rate are investigated. These factors include Transport Protocol, Infection Length, Target Vector and Scanning Pattern, Scan rate, round trip time, Bandwidth, Queue buildup, and the number of parallel connections. The study will help to get insight the TCP and UDP internet worms, their life cycle, methods selecting target victims and the critical parameters that may affect their spread rate.
The profitability in cybercrime activity has resulted into an exponential growth of malware numbers and complexity. This has led to both industry and academic research building malware research labs to allow for deeper malware analysis so that for more efficient detection techniques can be proposed. Extended malware study could lead to development of more advanced malware signatures, potentially resulting into designing of secure systems thus a resilient cyberspace. Malware classification and clustering based on malware families and traits is an important step in malware analysis. This paper presents a comparative study of file format hashes that are used in the industry is conducted in an effort towards suggesting an approach for faster and easier offline malware classification framework.
The growth and capabilities of cyberspace have brought about many advantages to societies. Individuals and businesses have used cyberspace for easier communication, but nation-states also utilise it to improve the functioning of their critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructures provide vital services such as the health, safety and security needed for the efficient functioning of societies. However, vulnerabilities in cyberspace have made cyberattacks such as cyberwarfare possible. Cyberwarfare is an international concern due to the negative impact it can have on critical infrastructure. This paper aims to discuss cyberwarfare and the potential effects that it can have on critical infrastructure. This paper follows a theoretical research methodology to provide an understanding of cyberwarfare. In addition, the paper provides a better understanding of the impact that cyberwarfare can have on critical infrastructure. The paper contains an exhaustive definition of cyberwarfare. Since cyberwarfare is a type of cyberattack, it is similar but not the same as other cyberattacks such as cybercrime and cyberterrorism. Therefore, to gain a clear understanding of cyberwarfare, the paper discusses cyberwarfare, cybercrime, and cyberterrorism. The paper also discusses some of the most significant cyberwarfare incidents. Since the effects can be devastating, critical infrastructure must be protected from cyberwarfare. A survey of techniques for protecting critical infrastructure from cyberwarfare is presented. The identified incidents highlight the effects that cyberwarfare can cause. Hence, the possible effects that cyberwarfare can cause on critical infrastructure is discussed. Due to the negative effects of cyberwarfare, nations need to be prepared to protect their critical infrastructure from cyberwarfare. Therefore, the paper also discusses the authors' stance on South Africa preparedness to defend themselves in the event of cyberwarfare.
Cybercrime is significantly growing as the development of internet technology. To mitigate this issue, the law enforcement adopts network surveillance technology to track a suspect and derive the online profile. However, the traditional network surveillance using the single-device tracking method can only acquire part of a suspect's online activities. With the emergence of different types of devices (e.g., personal computers, mobile phones, and smart wearable devices) in the mobile edge computing (MEC) environment, one suspect can employ multiple devices to launch a cybercrime. In this paper, we investigate a novel cross-device tracking approach which is able to correlate one suspect's different devices so as to help the law enforcement monitor a suspect's online activities more comprehensively. Our approach is based on the network traffic analysis of instant messaging (IM) applications, which are typical commercial service providers (CSPs) in the MEC environment. We notice a new habit of using IM applications, that is, one individual logs in the same account on multiple devices. This habit brings about devices' receiving sync messages, which can be utilized to correlate devices. We choose five popular apps (i.e., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, QQ, and Skype) to prove our approach's effectiveness. The experimental results show that our approach can identify IM messages with highF1-scores (e.g., QQ's PC message is 0.966, and QQ's phone message is 0.924) and achieve an average correlating accuracy of 89.58% of five apps in an 8-people experiment, with the fastest correlation speed achieved in 100 s.
In the public mind, Bitcoin has often been associated with censorship circumvention and evasion of surveillance measures, specifically in the context of monetary transactions. However, this perceived anonymity is a false sense of security as both on-chain transactions and the underlying message exchange in the peer-to-peer network are attack vectors for deanonymisation and monitoring, as shown in other research. Nonetheless, there has been an increase in Bitcoin usage not only for end-users but also in the context of cybercrime in the form of cryptojacking and ransomware. So there are a number of reasons why proxies might be used in the Bitcoin network, either as a privacy-preserving measure of end-users or as obfuscation in cybercrime. In this paper, we present a measurement study with the goal of characterising the proxy and VPN usage in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. We developed YABA (Yet Another Bitcoin Analyser) to gather network data in a geographically distributed fashion and analyse it. We describe our techniques to infer proxy/VPN usage and load on the peer through different latency measurements and the limitations of our approaches. We utilise port scanning of standard proxy/VPN service ports to compare results. We deployed our infrastructure on three continents (4 workers) and continuously crawled the network, with a total of 26.9 million connection attempts over five days. We conclude the usage of proxies to be minimal, with an estimated 0.4% of peers detected through latency measurements. Similar prevalence was measured through the use of port scans with SOCKS port hitrate at 0.3%, while common VPN ports had hitrates between 0.18% and 0.7%.
Mass-marketing frauds (MMFs) are on the increase. Given the amount of monies lost and the psychological impact of MMFs there is an urgent need to develop new and effective methods to prevent more of these crimes. This paper reports the early planning of automated methods our interdisciplinary team are developing to prevent and detect MMF. Importantly, the paper presents the ethical and social constraints involved in such a model and suggests concerns others might also consider when developing automated systems.
"This paper presents an evaluation of extant opportunity-reducing techniques employed to mitigate insider threats. Although both motive and opportunity are required to commit maleficence, this paper focuses on the concept of opportunity. Opportunity is more tangible than motive; hence it is more pragmatic to reflect on opportunity-reducing measures. To this end, opportunity theories from the field of criminology are considered. The exploratory evaluation proffers several areas of research and may assist organizations in implementing opportunity-reducing information security controls to mitigate insider threats. The evaluation is not definitive, but serves to inform future understanding. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Cybercrime is a growing problem in the United States and worldwide. Many questions remain unanswered as to the proper role and scope of criminal law in addressing socially undesirable actions affecting and conducted through the use of computers and modern information technologies. This Article tackles perhaps the most exigent question in US. cybercrime law-the scope of activities that should be subject to criminal sanction under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the federal antihacking statute. At the core of current CFAA debate is the question of whether private contracts, such as website terms of use or organizational acceptable use policies should be able to define the limits of authorization and access for purposes of criminal sanctions under the CFAA. Many scholars and activists argue that such contracts should not, because they may result in ridiculous consequences such as the criminalization of misrepresenting one's desirability on an online dating website. Critics of such arguments rebut that failing to allow contract-based restrictions opens the door for hackers to engage in many types of disfavored activity not otherwise subject to criminal sanction. This Article examines the tension between these two positions, both from the standpoint of current U.S. jurisprudence and scholarship, and from the standpoint of the respective purposes of criminal and tort law in deterring and punishing socially undesirable behavior. The Article concludes by proposing a legislative revision to the CFAA's mens rea element that substantially mitigates the risk of overbroad criminalization while leaving intact the ability of the law to deter and punish the most serious acts affecting and utilizing computers.
The reality today proves beyond any doubt a manifestation of an exacerbation of cybercrime in all its manifestations, the most common being those of unauthorized access to a computer system, theft of confidential data and their use for criminal purposes, modification of websites without permission from holders and others. Computer forgery is a criminal offense stipulated in the current Romanian Penal Code, the art. 325 and covers an area of specialized crime - acts committed in this context are likely to harm the production of materials, with very high costs and sometimes difficult to recover. In this case, combating or preventing the committing of such crimes represents a necessity of our days.
Cloud computing technologies are one of the most developed knowledge fields today. However, the rapid growth of cloud computing has made cybercrime crime grow. This poses new challenges to investigating. Currently, there have been many research models and frameworks that support the forensics investigation process and methodology, but the existing frameworks are not suitable to be implemented automatically in a cloud environment. By using a literature survey, the researcher proposes a model that can be applied to a cloud environment. The proposed model is expected to carry out investigations automatically and aims to maximize the use of digital evidence so that readiness can be achieved.
Cybersecurity attacks in healthcare have evolved towards social engineering and human-based intervention, showing increased frequency and success of such attacks. Increased priority and resources towards human factors training can reduce cybercriminal opportunity in healthcare. A cybersecurity workshop, developed following the ADDIE model, allowed frontline healthcare workforce and nursing students to increase their knowledge and confidence abilities against windows of opportunity for cybercrime. Participants confidence in cybersecurity skills use in daily practice significantly increased while participants knowledge showed a positive tendency. A list of actions for enhancing the cybersecurity in healthcare training is discussed as guidance for current and future curricula.
This article argues that application of the term cybercrime is overly expansive and by this nature exclusive of lesser deviancies, or microdeviations. These relatively minor deviant actions are frequently encountered online but are ineffectively checked by regulation. Their banal nature contributes to normalization, informing manufactured uncertainty and moral panic. Several examples of microdeviation are explored emphasizing the intersection of normalization and anxiety and the potential impact on digital spaces. While this issue is only part of the greater societal impact of informationalization, it nonetheless raises important questions as the global north progresses toward harmonizing Internet regulations.
In this paper, a case study of cyber crime is presented in the context of JNTUHJAC website. CERT-In is identified as the organization relevant to handling this kind of cybercrime. This paper is an attempt to find and do away with the lacunae in the prevailing cyber laws and the I.T. Act 2000 and the related amendment act 2008 such that law takes cognizance of all kinds of cybercrimes perpetrated against individuals/societies/nations. It is found that ICANN is an organization to control the cyberspace by blocking the space wherein the content involves cognizable offence.
"Women have been the object of victimization for centuries and portrayed as the lesser sex in many cultures around the world. Crimes such as rape, domestic violence and stalking would predominantly happen to women. In the age of the Internet and borderless information, women have become the targeted sex with a high risk of victimization. Stalking, a crime that was once considered traditional have now transcend into cyberspace and fast becoming more dangerous and invasive than its conventional counterpart specifically in its harm and impact onto the victims. In the past decade, cyber stalking has escalated alarmingly and it is commonly committed by intimate partners and strangers alike; the gender-based commission by men and the victimization of women cannot be ignored. It is within this context that this paper seeks to examine the gendered nature of cyberstalking as a type of technology-facilitated violence against women in cyberspace. Importantly, the paper will also analyse the legal positions governing such crime in Malaysia. This article employs a doctrinal analysis using secondary data from the Penal Code, Communication and Multimedia Act 1998, law reports, academic journals, books, and online databases. The authors contend that women are the most vulnerable targets in cyberstalking victimization as the modus operandi of the crime is concealed by the shadow of anonymity and facilitated via trans-border connectivity. The Malaysian anti-stalking laws need to be urgently reviewed in order to sufficiently provide adequate protection and remedies to the victims of cyber stalking, particularly to women victims.

BACKGROUND: The adoption of healthcare technology is arduous, and it requires planning and implementation time. Healthcare organizations are vulnerable to modern trends and threats because it has not kept up with threats. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to identify cybersecurity trends, including ransomware, and identify possible solutions by querying academic literature. METHODS: The reviewers conducted three separate searches through the CINAHL and PubMed (MEDLINE) and the Nursing and Allied Health Source via ProQuest databases. Using key words with Boolean operators, database filters, and hand screening, we identified 31 articles that met the objective of the review. RESULTS: The analysis of 31 articles showed the healthcare industry lags behind in security. Like other industries, healthcare should clearly define cybersecurity duties, establish clear procedures for upgrading software and handling a data breach, use VLANs and deauthentication and cloud-based computing, and to train their users not to open suspicious code. CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare industry is a prime target for medical information theft as it lags behind other leading industries in securing vital data. It is imperative that time and funding is invested in maintaining and ensuring the protection of healthcare technology and the confidentially of patient information from unauthorized access.
Industrial reports indicate that security incidents continue to inflict large financial losses on organizations. Researchers and industrial analysts contend that there are fundamental problems with existing security incident response process solutions. This paper presents the Security Incident Response Criteria (SIRC) which can be applied to a variety of security incident response approaches. The criteria are derived from empirical data based on in-depth interviews conducted within a Global Fortune 500 organization and supporting literature. The research contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the criteria presented in this paper can be used to evaluate existing security incident response solutions and second, as a guide, to support future security incident response improvement initiatives.
The purpose of this article is to raise awareness of issues associated with misleading or deceptive conduct under the Australian Consumer Law and domain names. The article provides a brief discussion on some key decisions on misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to domain names containing similar wording and/or similar corresponding websites. It also discusses what a domain name is, and what characteristics and functions it serves to users, and also explores several different types of cybercrime, including cybersquatting of domain names. The article concludes with some short tips on how to minimise the risks of being engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to domain names.
Cybercrime is one of the most difficult features of contemporary digital technology. Hence, it is crucial to restrict and perhaps even prevent its impacts. Systems are protected against numerous harmful attacks by Intrusion Detection (ID) systems. One method for figuring out a system's typical behavior is to look at the call sequences the system processes make. In this paper, an ID system was devised based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that is more accurate than conventional RNNs. The performance of the proposed ID model produced a high accuracy, detection rate, and low false alarm rate. Thus, supporting the model's reputability.
Due to the rapid proliferation of Android malware, conventional antimalware signature-based solutions face significant challenges to battle against cybercrime. In this work, we propose to use quantitative data flow profiles between system entities such as processes, files and sockets to detect malicious applications on Android, an approach which has been shown to be promising for detecting-Windows malware. Our approach uses features based on graph-theoretical metrics as a basis for the analysis. Those features are trained through multiple machine learning algorithms obtaining malware detection rates of up to 93% for variants of known ( trained) families and detection of new families of up to 84%.
"Despite the growth in literature examining fear of cybercrime, few studies have examined altruistic fear online. Additionally, few studies have examined ransomware fear, potentially limiting the effectiveness of fear reduction policies. Using randomly assigned vignettes administered to online samples (n = 428; 432), findings indicate that perceptions of disorder were associated with increased personal fear, yet were not associated with altruistic ransomware fear. Social cohesion was associated with altruistic fear, yet was not associated with personal fear. Findings demonstrate the need for fear reduction policies to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of fear and adapt explanatory models to online contexts."
The Internet, a useful tool for communicating information, is now a pervasive and necessary infrastructure for modern economy. Accordingly, because of economic motivations, it became an arena for cyberwarfare and cybercrime. In this paper, we present the novel threat called SlowComm and we show how it can successfully lead a DoS on a targeted system using a small amount of attack bandwidth. Further, since the proposed attack is not bounded to a specific protocol, it can be considered a protocol independent attack, proving the ability it has to affect different Internet services.

In this paper, we propose the experimental construction of a new attacker typology grounded in real-life data, using grounded theory analysis and over 200 publicly available documents containing details of digital banking related cybercrime and involved attackers. The current state of this research area is introduced briefly, high-lighting current issues and shortcomings. This is supported by a brief investigation into the mechanisms of the construction of previous taxonomies and typologies. Eight attacker profiles forming the typology specific to the case of digital banking are presented. A short discussion of contributions made and suggestions for future research directions in this field are also added.
"Technology has dramatically simplified the process of engaging in a variety of crimes, particularly the distribution of child exploitation materials, or CEM. The ability to share photos and video across the globe through high speed Internet connections and mobile devices has made it easy to access CEM. At the same time, technology has complicated the investigation of these crimes by increasing the scope of spaces to police that is operated by public and private entities. This review outlines the challenges inherent in the investigation of CEM in the context of Wall's typology of policing online spaces, recognizing formal and informal sources of social control. The methods used by law enforcement to affect CEM are discussed, highlighting current limitations inherent in online investigations; namely the sheer scope of the problem and the nexus between rapid technological advances and commensurate legal responses, among others. The review highlights the need for engagement from industrial and non-governmental organizations in addition to law enforcement in order to facilitate the investigation of CEM offenses; strategies to improve the state of policing CEM need to include integrating public and private sphere responses to these offenses."
Cybersecurity is a major challenge especially as the world transitions to the fourth industrial revolution. Cybercriminals are always perceived to be using complex sophisticated mechanisms to launch attacks to information systems. It is however worth exploring Social Engineering as one of the arts used to exploit the weakest layer of information security systems, who are the users. In the recent past, the world has witnessed a gradual gain in popularity of Social Engineering attacks propagated through varied forms, including, phishing, vishing and smishing. Hence, this paper presents and demonstrates an analytical approach towards Social Engineering. The study explored the level of understanding of three forms of Social Engineering and the prevalence of Social Engineering attacks with their countermeasures. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected from a random sample through an online survey and face-to-face interviews. Data analysis showed that vishing and smishing are the most commonly used forms of Social Engineering in Kenya with the use of authority featuring as a persuasion strategy used by attackers striving for financial gain. The lack of user education and awareness outstandingly came out as the main reason behind a majority of successful attacks. The study was limited to Kenya as a representative of developing Nations in Africa. The resulting study outcomes could form a foundation for the development of information security policies and awareness programs. This could further translate into National or International Laws on Social Engineering based Cyber-attacks.
Law enforcement faces problems in tracing the true identity of offenders in cybercrime investigations. Most offenders mask their true identity, impersonate people of high authority, or use identity deception and obfuscation tactics to avoid detection and traceability. To address the problem of anonymity, authorship analysis is used to identify individuals by their writing styles without knowing their actual identities. Most authorship studies are dedicated to English due to its widespread use over the Internet, but recent cyber-attacks such as the distribution of Stuxnet indicate that Internet crimes are not limited to a certain community, language, culture, ideology, or ethnicity. To effectively investigate cybercrime and to address the problem of anonymity in online communication, there is a pressing need to study authorship analysis of languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and so on. Arabic, the focus of this study, is the fourth most widely used language on the Internet. This study investigates authorship of Arabic discourse/text, especially tiny text, Twitter posts. We benchmark the performance of a profile-based approach that uses n-grams as features and compare it with state-of-the-art instance-based classification techniques. Then we adapt an event-visualization tool that is developed for English to accommodate both Arabic and English languages and visualize the result of the attribution evidence. In addition, we investigate the relative effect of the training set, the length of tweets, and the number of authors on authorship classification accuracy. Finally, we show that diacritics have an insignificant effect on the attribution process and part-of-speech tags are less effective than character-level and word-level n-grams.
Cybercrime is growing dramatically in the technological world nowadays. World Wide Web criminals exploit the personal information of internet users and use them to their advantage. Unethical users leverage the dark web to buy and sell illegal products or services and sometimes they manage to gain access to classified government information. A number of illegal activities that can be found in the dark web include selling or buying hacking tools, stolen data, digital fraud, terrorists activities, drugs, weapons, and more. The aim of this project is to collect evidence of any malicious activity in the dark web by using computer security mechanisms as traps called honeypots.
Fake news and its significance carried the significance of affecting diverse aspects of diverse entities, ranging from a city lifestyle to a country global relativity, various methods are available to collect and determine fake news. The recently developed machine learning (ML) models can be employed for the detection and classification of fake news. This study designs a novel Chaotic Ant Swarm with Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (CAS-WELM) for Cybersecurity Fake News Detection and Classification. The goal of the CAS-WELM technique is to discriminate news into fake and real. The CAS-WELM technique initially pre-processes the input data and Glove technique is used for word embedding process. Then, N-gram based feature extraction technique is derived to generate feature vectors. Lastly, WELM model is applied for the detection and classification of fake news, in which the weight value of the WELM model can be optimally adjusted by the use of CAS algorithm. The performance validation of the CAS-WELM technique is carried out using the benchmark dataset and the results are inspected under several dimensions. The experimental results reported the enhanced outcomes of the CAS-WELM technique over the recent approaches.
Data from Online Social Networks, search engines, and the World Wide Web are forms of unstructured knowledge that are not regularly used in cybersecurity systems. The main reason for the reluctance to utilize them is the difficulty to process them effectively and extract valuable information. In this paper, we present the Systemic Analyzer In Network Threats (SAINT) Observatory Subsystem or SAINToS for short, a novel platform for the acquisition and analysis of Open-Source Intelligence feeds. The proposed framework integrates different information pools to create a supplementary view of the evolving cybercriminal activity. The aim of SAINToS, is to provide additional models, methodologies, and mechanisms to enrich existing cybersecurity analysis. As a significant amount of related information is not standardized in the form of structured data tables or machine-processable formats (e.g., XML or JSON), secondary data sources, such as social networks and blogs, are expected to expand the scope and effectiveness of existing approaches. The emphasis of this work, is placed on the harmonization and visualization of data from different sources. As a result, these sources can be better understood and reused. In addition, the SAINToS, besides its standalone functionality and capabilities, can provide input, in standard formats, to additional major threat intelligence platforms.
Cloud Computing Management has introduced a whole new meaning to globalism. Control over national security, criminal conduct, medical records, trade, intellectual property, privacy and a host of other important rights and responsibilities is governed by a paradigm that is conducted in the internet cloud. Cloud computing depends upon a level of inter-connectedness that crosses legal borders, yet has no boundaries. Cloud-computing regulations in one jurisdiction may have no application in another jurisdiction. However, important laws such as the U. S. Patriot Act, the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS), and the European Union privacy laws are applicable regardless of the location of the cloud service provider. A global legal framework that balances national and private interests would enhance confidence and improve legal certainty in the global electronic marketplace. This article examines the existing legal and ethical concepts and doctrines for cyber law and organizes a conceptual legal structure for cloud computing management. Based on empirical research, international legal theory, and an analysis of international and national legal regimes and case decisions, this article explores the advantages and the challenges of establishing a global legal framework for cloud computing that advances cooperation and innovation in the cloud, while protecting the rights of the communities of users on earth.
The emergence of the Internet of Things devices in everyday life has increased its sales dramatically over recent years, specifically of smart devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers and smart phones. The number of vulnerabilities exploited has also risen in tandem with the increased sales. The attack vectors have greatly increased due to the connectivity and mass functionality of these devices. The lack of security in smartwatches, marketed towards children, poses a prominent threat for their safety and security. Results reported in this paper revealed significant security vulnerabilities in several popular kids' smartwatches when exploited by SMS command injection, Bluetooth tracking and Wi-Fi man in the middle attack. The devices investigated were kids' smartwatches, a fitness tracker and a smart phone with varying functions, connections and security features. Findings of the paper raise concerns as vulnerabilities of kids' IoT smart devices can lead to criminal cases, such as child grooming and child abduction.
The present study aims to examine whether criminogenic risk factors can be applied to explain different types of juvenile offenses involving traditional and/or cyber offenses, and explore their common and unique patterns presented among juvenile offenders. To achieve the goals, this study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to construct a decision support system that predicts different types of juvenile offenses (i.e., non-offense, hacking only, traditional offense only, and both offenses) by risk factors rooted in a variety of criminological theories. This study is based on the data from the Second International Self-Report of Delinquency Study. The results demonstrate the generalizability of mainstream criminological theories to juvenile hacking and dual offenses involving both traditional offense and hacking. ML predictive models can successfully distinguish between different types of juvenile offenders and identify the most influential risk factors (e.g., gender, digital piracy, substance use, victimization, and parental supervision). The relative importance of risk factors provides valuable information to decision-makers and stakeholders in the juvenile justice system for developing more effective risk assessments and early intervention programs targeting different types of juvenile offenders.
Purpose This study aims to illustrate and determine how illegally obtained funds are laundered through online platforms and companies in different economic sectors in the digital age. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative analysis approach using purpose sampling methods, including 21 semi-structured interviews with prevention experts, compliance officers and convicted cybercriminals, resulted in the determination of concrete money-laundering methods involving the employment of online platforms provided by companies and institutions in different economic sectors. Findings The current study focuses on various companies in different economic segments that mitigate cyber laundering and the anti-money laundering measures that can be adopted. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed discussion and analysis on how money launderers avoid being detected. Both preventive and criminal perspectives are taken into consideration. Originality/value By identifying the gaps in the current anti-money-laundering mechanisms, it will provide compliance officers, legislators and law enforcement agencies with an in-depth insight into how cyber laundering operates in various economic sectors.
The recent scandal over the appropriation of users' data from the Facebook platform serves to surface wider concerns about 'big data', relating inter alia to the ways in which personal data are obtained, stored and used for commercial purposes. This article outlines some of the issues involved, and sketches some of the ways in which theologically inspired reflection and action might begin to address those issues.
The evolution of policing towards the next generation, not only involves confronting new types of crime such as cybercrime, but also the active engagement of citizens in the process of creating a secure environment through the deployment of community policing practices. However, in order to fully exploit the potential of community policing, the building of trust between citizens and Law Enforcement Officers is important. In this paper, the authors (all participating in the EU Research project on community policing TRILLION), discuss issues related to the use of innovative technologies, while ensuring societal approval, in the context of community policing. Both requirements and corresponding work leading to the actual implementation of a fully operational platform are presented.
Purpose Global evidence suggests a potential displacement of youth offending from the physical to the digital landscape, requiring revision of existing detection and intervention methods. This study aims to explore pathways from harmful to illegal online activity perpetrated by young people, legislation and police perspectives, current detection methods and interventions. Design/methodology/approach This perspective paper examines issues observed within a larger systematic literature review on digital youth offending. Findings A trajectory from acceptable to harmful and subsequently illegal behaviour was identified, with a particular pathway from unethical video game activity to digitally dependent offending. Legislation and police perspectives vary by jurisdiction, with a common theme that increased officer education is key to the level of preparedness to investigate cases. Machine learning and automatic prevention show promise as detection and disruption processes, with education recommended for young people as a deterrent and redirection of skills to positive outcomes. Research limitations/implications Recommendations for further research include a broad survey of school students to include all identified areas of digital offending, which could drive the development of targeted education by law enforcement and partner agencies for young people. Practical implications The shift in youth offending requires the justice and educational systems to adjust how they respond to youth crime. Policy and practise shifts can include further exploration of investigative hacking, education for law enforcement and educational prevention and redirection programmes aimed at youth. Originality/value The digital displacement of youth offending is a progressively emerging concept. This paper examines the current state of response from educational and law enforcement agencies and discusses the next steps based on what is currently known.
Recently the CJEU decision in the case of 'Ewa Glawischnig-Piesczek v. Facebook Ireland Limited' has raised the issue of the transcultural/trans-territorial signification of hate speech and hate crimes. Taking a cue from this decision and the related semiotic/legal implications, the paper proposes an analysis of the semio/pragmatic conditions for the production of performativity inherent in hate speech across different cultural universes of discourse. Given that web-based digital communication is global-at least, potentially-regardless of any spatial/political compartmentalization, it crosses different semio-cultural circuits. This trans-spatiality implies transcultural crossings that can multiply and even transfigure the semantic implications of the original signifier and the related prognoses of 'semantic effectiveness.' Cultural boundaries therefore may function as a kind of 'horizon of events' for hate speech and, more inclusively, all linguistic acts and their legal signification/classification. The question then arises regarding whether and to what extent the performativity of hate speech is able to withstand the variation of cultural boundary conditions. Insofar as cultures are universes of experience, the issue to be investigated broadens, and ends up invoking the question of whether or not the production of performativity implicitly presupposes and tacitly epitomizes the semio-pragmatic implications/consequences (or, in Peircean terms, 'bearings') coextensive with cultural universes of experience. Were this the case, it would seem to call into question the very possibility of 'making things only with words,' or more explicitly, the alleged meaning of 'linguistic acts.'
Hackers often engage in website defacement early in their criminal careers to establish a reputation. Some hackers become increasingly prolific and launch a large number of attacks against their targets, whereas others only launch a few attacks before eventually desisting from a life of crime. A better understanding of why some hackers launch a large number of attacks, while others do not, will assist in the implementation of targeted intervention strategies. Therefore, the current study, using a sample of 119 active hackers, seeks to answer two research questions: (1) Are there different groups of website defacers based on attack volume? (2) Which observed hacker-level characteristics can be used to predict latent class membership? We find that two unique groups of website defacers exist: low-volume defacers (69%) and high-volume defacers (31%). Social media presence, the content of the defacement, and the type of defacement are all predictive of latent class membership. Policy implications are discussed.
Digital economy is strengthening in prominence and relevance in the era of digital transformation. The economic opportunity and growth of nations are dependent on the digital world, as world community increasingly connected in the cyber-space. The boom in digital economy is coupled with cyber risks and cyber threats for nations. National cybersecurity strategy (NCSS) is an essential element as cybersecurity is needed to protect and enable digital economy. This article seeks to gain insights on the correlation of the development of the NCSS and the success of digital economy of the nation. NCSS of nine nations analysed based on digital economy success. The top nation of digital economy released its NCSS the latest, in 2016. NCSS is not a requirement to kick start digital economy. It is, however, essential for the continuous growth and success in digital economy.
"Case studies suggest a relationship between Asperger syndrome (AS) and computer hacking. The current study examined whether characteristics associated with AS were significantly related to hacking, cyberbullying, identity theft, and virus writing. Two hundred and ninety-six university undergraduate students completed an Internet-based anonymous survey measuring self-reported computer deviant behaviour and characteristics associated with AS (autism-spectrum quotient; AQ). Of the 296 university students, 179 (60%) engaged in some form of computer deviant behaviour, but only 2 (0.01%) yielded clinically significant scores according to the AQ. Contrary to the authors' expectations, hackers did not score higher on the AQ compared to non-computer hackers. However, virus writers, identity thieves, and cyberbullies scored higher on the AQ compared to their computer non-deviant counterparts. In addition, individuals who engaged in hacking, identity theft, cyberbullying, and virus writing scored higher on the AQ and reported poorer social skills, poorer communication, and poorer imagination compared to all other individuals engaging in computer deviant behaviours. Considerations for future research and study limitations are discussed."
The significant economic and emotional consequences of online fraud have not been equally matched by the policing response to these offenses. This paper examines constables' and sergeants' perceived preparation to respond to online fraud through a quantitative analyses of survey data collected from over 1300 officers from 35 local police agencies across England and Wales. The findings demonstrated that constables and sergeants being prepared to respond to online fraud was related to agencies having clear policies and procedures, constables having computer skills and online incident experiences, and being able to relate to fraud victims. The implications of this study for first responder training and resource development to respond to cybercrimes are considered.
This paper presents the results of a qualitative study on discussions about two major law enforcement interventions against Dark Net Market (DNM) users extracted from relevant Reddit forums. We assess the impact of Operation Hyperion and Operation Bayonet (combined with the closure of the site Hansa) by analyzing posts and comments made by users of two Reddit forums created for the discussion of Dark Net Markets. The operations are compared in terms of the size of the discussions, the consequences recorded, and the opinions shared by forum users. We find that Operation Bayonet generated a higher number of discussions on Reddit, and from the qualitative analysis of such discussions it appears that this operation also had a greater impact on the DNM ecosystem.
"In recent years, cybercrime has focused profoundly on people to bypass existing sophisticated security controls; phishing is one of the most common forms of such attacks. Phishing is an online extortion which combines social engineering tools and technical tricks designed to earn computer users' hypersensitive personally identifiable information (PII). To prevent from phishing attacks, phishing awareness needs to be considered. This research aims to highlights the problem of phishing and to examine the user's computer security behaviour in developing an anti-phishing educational framework. The paper introduces Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT): a theoretical model which is used to address various design issues and principles that were used as guidelines for structuring and presenting information."

Findings Today, the computer crimes are increasing at a high rate, and it should be controlled and managed to maintain the platform .Cyberspace on the other hand can be discussed as the space where all internet-related activities are taking place and cyberlaw regulates. The paper will throw light on the impact of internet on the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value The paper will throw light on the impact of internet on the COVID-19 pandemic."
Ransomware (malware that threatens to lock or publish victims' assets unless a ransom is paid) has become a serious security threat, targeting individual users, companies and even governments, causing significant damage, disruption and cost. Instances of ransomware have also been observed stealing private data and blackmailing their victims. Worryingly, the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the massive amount of personal data that they collect have opened up another avenue of attack. The main aim of this paper is to determine whether privacy invasion based ransomware would be a viable vector for attackers to use on IoT devices. The secondary aim is to identify countermeasures that can be implemented to prevent such attacks from being used. To accomplish these aims, we examined how private data accessible via IoT devices could be obtained, processed and managed by a ransomware attacker. We identified a number of data sources on IoT devices that can be used to access private data, such as audio and video feeds. We then investigated methods to interpret such data in order to blackmail the device's owner. We then produced proof of concept malware for multiple IoT devices, including an external collator that manages the valuable data collected, demonstrating that an attack could be performed at scale. This research shows that attackers can use the functionality of an infected device to invade the privacy of the device's owner, as part of a ransomware attack. We have demonstrated that, given suitable infrastructure, attackers would be able to ransom users for values higher than the cost of the compromised device, as well as heavily damage the trust in the device itself, which would cause further negative impact on the device manufacturer. Finally, we highlight the need for proactive measures to deter this style of attack by applying the suggested countermeasures.
In this research, the authors employ the framework of Routine Activities Theory (RAT) to examine how receiving phishing attempts is associated with identity theft victimization. In addition, the study assesses whether receiving phishing attempts mediates the relationships between other indicators, including routine online activities, fear of victimization, and sociodemographic characteristics and identity theft victimization. Data from the Korea Crime Victim Survey (KCVS) 2008 is analyzed and the results suggest that the respondents who have received phishing attempts are more likely to be victimized by identity theft. Moreover, education level, routine online activities and fear of identity theft victimization are positively related with identity theft victimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Graph theory serves as an engaging arena for the investigation of proof methods within the field of discrete mathematics, and its findings find practical utility in numerous scientific domains. Chemical graph theory is a specialized branch of mathematics that uses graphs to represent and analyze the structure and properties of chemical compounds. Topological indices are mathematical properties of graphs that play a crucial role in chemistry. They provide a unique way to connect the structural characteristics of chemical compounds to their corresponding molecular graphs. The flabellum graph Fn(k,j) is obtained with the help of k >= 2 duplicates of the cycle graph Cn with a common vertex (known as, central vertex). Then, in j of these duplicates, additional edges are added, joining the central vertex to all non-adjacent vertices. In this article, we compute different degree-based topological indices for flabellum graphs, including some well known indices, such as the Randic index, the atom bond connectivity index, the geometric-arithmetic index, and the Zagreb indices. This research provides an in-depth examination of these specific indices within the context of flabellum graphs. Moreover, the behavior of these indices is shown graphically, in terms of the parameters j,k, and n. Additionally, we have extended the concept of the first Zagreb index, to address the issue of cybercrime. This application enables us to identify criminals who exhibit higher levels of activity and engagement in multiple criminal activities when compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of the first Zagreb index against the closeness centrality measure. This analysis sheds light on the effectiveness and relevance of the topological index in the context of cybercrime detection and network analysis.
"Individuals, shadowy criminal organizations, and nation states all currently possess the capacity to harm modern societies through computer attacks. These new and severe cyberthreats put critical information, infrastructure, and lives at risk and the threat is growing in scale and intensity with every passing day. The conventional response to such cyberthreats is self-reliance; but when self-reliance comes up short, states have turned to law for a solution. Cybercrime laws proscribe individuals from engaging in unwanted cyberactivities. Other international laws establish what states can (and cannot) do in terms of cyberwarfare. Both sets of rules work by attribution, targeting bad actors whether criminals or states-to deter cyberthreats. This Article challenges the sufficiency of existing cyberlaw and security. Law cannot regulate the authors of cyberthreats because anonymity is built into the very structure of the Internet. As a result, existing rules on cybercrime and cyberwar have little deterrent effect. They may even create new problems when attackers and victims assume that different rules apply to the same conduct. Instead of regulating bad actors, this Article proposes that states adopt a duty to assist victims of the most severe cyberthreats. A duty to assist provides victims with assistance to avoid or mitigate serious harms. At sea, anyone who hears a victim's SOS must offer whatever assistance is reasonable. An e-SOS would work in a similar way. It would require assistance for cyberthreat victims without requiring them to know who, if anyone, was threatening them. An e-SOS system could help avoid harms from existing cyberthreats and deter others. Even when cyberthreats succeed, an e-SOS could make computer systems and networks more resilient against any harm they impose. At the same time, an e-SOS would complement, rather than compete with, self-reliant measures and existing legal proscriptions against cyberthreats."
Take-down operations aim to disrupt cybercrime involving malicious domains. In the past decade, many successful take-down operations have been reported, including those against the Conficker worm, and most recently, against VPNFilter. Although it plays an important role in fighting cybercrime, the domain take-down procedure is still surprisingly opaque. There seems to be no in-depth understanding about how the take-down operation works and whether there is due diligence to ensure its security and reliability. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on domain takedown. Our study was made possible via a large collection of data, including various sinkhole feeds and blacklists, passive DNS data spanning six years, and historical WHOIS information. Over these datasets, we built a unique methodology that extensively used various reverse lookups and other data analysis techniques to address the challenges in identifying taken-down domains, sinkhole operators, and take-down durations. Applying the methodology on the data, we discovered over 620K taken-down domains and conducted a longitudinal analysis on the take-down process, thus facilitating a better understanding of the operation and its weaknesses. We found that more than 14% of domains taken-down over the past ten months have been released back to the domain market and that some of the released domains have been repurchased by the malicious actor again before being captured and seized, either by the same or different sinkholes. In addition, we showed that the misconfiguration of DNS records corresponding to the sinkholed domains allowed us to hijack a domain that was seized by the FBI. Further, we found that expired sinkholes have caused the transfer of around 30K taken-down domains whose traffic is now under the control of new owners.
Exploring the Tor network requires acquiring onion addresses, which are crucial for accessing anonymous websites. However, the Tor protocol presents a challenge, as it lacks a standard method for finding these complex links composed of either 16 or 56 base32-coded characters and featuring the unique .oniontop-level domain. This study delves into the existing literature analyzing onion services and categorizes the various strategies employed to gather their addresses. The success of each approach is measured by the number of addresses obtained, while the relevancy of the work is evaluated by comparing the number of services uncovered to Tor's official count. The results indicate that the most used techniques are Tor crawling and repositories, whereas the most effective methods are relay injection, repositories, and Tor crawling. This paper also estimates the representativeness of literature collections, revealing that most past works explored a small portion of the Tor network. The study also uncovers the limitations of onion gathering and sheds light on the challenges for future research to provide more representative datasets for dark web exploration.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Computer forensics faces a range of challenges due to the widespread use of computing technologies. Examples include the increasing volume of data and devices that need to be analysed in any single case, differing platforms, use of encryption and new technology paradigms (such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things). Automation within forensic tools exists, but only to perform very simple tasks, such as data carving and file signature analysis. Investigators are responsible for undertaking the cognitively challenging and time-consuming process of identifying relevant artefacts. Due to the volume of cyber-dependent (e.g., malware and hacking) and cyber-enabled (e.g., fraud and online harassment) crimes, this results in a large backlog of cases. With the aim of speeding up the analysis process, this paper investigates the role that unsupervised pattern recognition can have in identifying notable artefacts. A study utilising the Self-Organising Map (SOM) to automatically cluster notable artefacts was devised using a series of four cases. Several SOMs were created - a File List SOM containing the metadata of files based upon the file system, and a series of application level SOMs based upon metadata extracted from files themselves (e.g., EXIF data extracted from JPEGs and email metadata extracted from email files). A total of 275 sets of experiments were conducted to determine the viability of clustering across a range of network configurations. The results reveal that more than 93.5% of notable artefacts were grouped within the rank-five clusters in all four cases. The best performance was achieved by using a 10 x 10 SOM where all notables were clustered in a single cell with only 1.6% of the non-notable artefacts (noise) being present, highlighting that SOM-based analysis does have the potential to cluster notable versus noise files to a degree that would significantly reduce the investigation time. Whilst clustering has proven to be successful, operationalizing it is still a challenge (for example, how to identify the cluster containing the largest proportion of notables within the case). The paper continues to propose a process that capitalises upon SOM and other parameters such as the timeline to identify notable artefacts whilst minimising noise files. Overall, based solely upon unsupervised learning, the approach is able to achieve a recall rate of up to 93%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
PurposeTechnological expansion and adoption in university libraries have precipitated cybercrimes and the need to equip library personnel with the required knowledge to combat this menace. Consequently, this study aims to examine cyber security in university libraries and its implication for Library and Information Science education. Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted descriptive research design, while questionnaire and interview were used to elicit data from library personnel and heads of library schools, respectively. A total of 134 responses were elicited through structured questionnaire (administered online due to the closure of universities) while six heads of library schools were interviewed, one from each of the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. FindingsThe data from the questionnaire which were descriptively analysed revealed that the perceived knowledge of cyber security among the librarians was moderately low. Also, the university libraries were exposed to various cyber threats, with cyber security/guideline been one of the critical measures to combat cybercrime. Also, the result showed that librarians displayed high level of adherence to cyber ethics. However, the disposition of library management towards cyber security issues was revealed to be the main challenge to the deployment of cyber security in university libraries, follow by poor password management. Majority of the librarians possess basic knowledge of cyber security, though with serious interest to learn more about it. They were not taught cyber security in library school and they indicated enthusiasm to learn about it. The result of the interview with heads of library schools showed majority of these schools do not offer cyber security course due to dearth in skilled manpower. Originality/valueThe study presents cybercrime as a menace, if not tackled, would affect the university libraries' sustainability as information institution, compromising their ability to deliver quality services.
Due to the diffusion of mobile devices, more and more people access e-learning platforms from mobile phones. Students learn from digital books and have access to information anytime and anywhere. However, with billions of mobile users worldwide, as well as billions of under-protected Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the risk of being the target of malware, cybercrime and sophisticated attacks is high. This paper proposes and discusses a set of visualization techniques applied to a dataset generated by DREBIN, a malware detection tool that performs a static analysis on apps installed to Android devices. On the base of dataset, we applied text, tree and graph visualization techniques to identify malware patterns. The visual findings can help the cybersecurity analyst in detecting malicious app behavior.
This paper interrogates cybersecurity awareness particularly as it relates to rural communities in Sango Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. Three communities were studied: Atun lju Ilogbo, Sango Ijoko, and Ado Odo Ota. Some of the core questions addressed include: What are the existing cybersecurity policies in Ogun State? What is the level of awareness of cybersecurity concerns among the people in the rural communities in Ota? What are the people's reactions to existing policies? How can the awareness be improved upon? Using survey and the diffusion of innovation theory, the paper argues for a reform in the methodology of dissemination of knowledge and the education of grassroots communities in relation to the demands of existing cybersecurity arrangements of the Nigerian governments.
A massive 400% increase of cyber-attacks was reported in the Marine industry since February 2020 up to date. Experiments and research are being conducted towards safeguarding data in various technological aspects of the marine environment with regards to navigation, transportation and system management. At present, generic investigation processes are developed for computer incidents and forensic readiness in this sector, but those do not describe the investigation process precisely. Although there are incident analysis technologies implemented for the Marine environment, it lacks reliable digital forensic tools for evidence extraction and analysis. Therefore, in this research, a comprehensive digital forensic investigation framework is proposed, answering the issues of existing frameworks, and a tool is implemented for the examination of navigational evidence. Forensic procedures of existing investigation methodologies were taken into consideration when developing the fusion framework. The Marine Geo Navigator was implemented with the technologies of Machine Learning and Visualization to evaluate geolocations and paths of vessels. Through expert analysis, the proposed investigation framework was verified as a suitable process to be utilized in the Marine industry and the tool was validated resulting an acceptable level of accuracy.
Never in the history of humanity, people all over the world are subject to exaction on a huge scale as they are today. In the recent years, the usage of PCs and the Internet has exploded and, along with this huge increase, cybercrooks have come to feed this souk, aiming acquitted consumers with a wide range of per-ware. Most of these threats are meant unswervingly or meanderingly in receiving currency from victims. Today, the ransomware appears to be one of the most unpleasant per-ware categories of the time. Several works have been published in the field of information and Internet security, various pernicious attacks, and cryptography. The objective of this research paper is to present everything with regard to latest crypto-virus trend known as ransomware. The paper explains the history, the modus operandi as well as the architecture of ransomware attack.
In this paper we investigate the problem of phishing. Phishing is a hybrid problem in that it involves both technical and social issues. In this paper, we also discuss the polymorphic nature of phishing attacks and how this can make defense more difficult. Despite the persistence of the phishing problem, there are ways to combat it and we discuss them in this paper. We highlight countermeasures to tackle phishing and propose suggestions to businesses in order to minimize the loss of revenue and reputation to phishing attacks. The paper discusses technical methods of defending against phishing attacks hardening the infrastructure, and training employees against phishing attacks.
"In this paper, we proposed an investigation approach to trace the source IP address hiding which use proxy servers, and reduce the steps of the classical investigation method. Furthermore, it does not need to execute search and seizure to perpetrators, but it still obtains the key digital evidences from a third party. The obtained key digital evidences have the same probative force with the classical investigation, and it can used to discover the perpetrator whether he hides his IP address and the criminal acts. In this paper, first, we proposed an approach that makes the case related people not be examined, searched and seized; second, the true criminal cannot evade punishments and trial by hiding his IP address, so the investigation procedure is hard to execute; third, the investigation approach we proposed will reduce wasting judicial resources and protect human rights effectively."
The current study aims to estimate and explain citizens' fear of identity theft victimization by examining data collected from a nationally representative sample of South Korean residents. Specifically, we compared participants' levels of fear of identity theft victimization with fear of other types of crime using paired-samples t-tests. We found that fear of identity theft victimization is significantly higher than fear of other types of crime. Drawing on routine activity theory, we explored the relationship between victimization (i.e., identity theft), online proximity to motivated offenders (i.e., phishing), online exposure to motivated offenders (e.g., online banking and shopping), target suitability (e.g., downloading pirated media), and fear of identity theft victimization. Results from ordinal logistic regression models suggest that victimization and online exposure to motivated offenders were significantly related to fear of identity theft victimization.
The whole world is experiencing a great informational change conducted by reshaping and redefining technological processes. The rapid growth of information technology (IT) has evolved security risks in all financial and non-financial sectors. This paper intends to accentuate the great exposure of financial and non-financial information in the new cybersecurity context, emphasizing the impact of IT on security threats, cyberattacks and information security. In this context, the author adopted the qualitative method, based on an empirical approach, where the examination of national and international cybersecurity threats reports has been performed. The paper brings forward a comparative synthesis of top current security threats and raises the awareness of cyber criminality by bringing to the fore security issues intending to aspire future research. This paper answers four key questions and is the first part of a large research process which the author aims to continue.
"Our world online and networked is immersed under awave of populism; populism spreads on the wings of internet. The recent technological advancements like the use of social media platforms and different applications made the information exchange faster and more efficient making the information access easier. To keep our information, gadgets such as cell phones, laptops, desktops, and tablets and also the internet safe, knowledge of cybersecurity is vital everywhere. In many colleges and Universities who are in to interconnected complex systems, data privacy is a huge challenge among their users. In most of the situations, due to lack of knowledge and awareness, users may engage in data breaches knowingly or unknowingly and the complete interconnected systems among the users may have a consequence of a cybercrime. This article seeks to unpack the rise of cyber-crimes and its relationship to cyber security among student groups during the pandemic where much of their interaction is online. The research aims to inquire in to the level of knowledge and awareness on cybersecurity among students during their online learning interaction using a well-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire will be focused on five parts: Awareness and Knowledge, Monitoring and Privilege, Security and Prevention, Protection from malware s and usage of removable Devices. The study is conducted using quantitative research methodology to quantitatively evaluate the knowledge of cybersecurity and inculcate an awareness against Cybercrime protection among the students. Finally, based on the analysis of collected data we present recommendations which will not forego the safety concerns for e mails, viruses, phishing, pop-up windows and forged ads which is a common problem. Some technological solutions and paths for the regulation of the cybercrimes are suggested to the respondents at the end."
Fake news or commonly known as a hoax has become one of the most visible cybercrime. Hoax news dissemination harms the social community, such as raising hatred towards something both individuals and groups. This paper is to classify amongst hoaxes and valid news utilizing Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method in this research based on Indonesian news. The dataset used is Indonesian news about Indonesia itself and the world from 2015 to early 2020. The study used 500 news data including 250 valid news and 250 hoax news, divided into 80% training data and 20% test data. The result of this study shows that the machine learning model created using XGBoost has an accuracy value of 89%, with the precision value of 90% and recall value 80%.
As a new type of underground ecosystem, the exploitation of Abused IHMs as MalIcious sErvices (AIMIEs) is becoming increasingly prevalent among miscreants to host illegal images and propagate harmful content. However, there has been little effort to understand this new menace, in terms of its magnitude, impact, and techniques, not to mention any serious effort to detect vulnerable image hosting modules on a large scale. To fulfill this gap, this paper presents the first measurement study of AIMIEs. By collecting and analyzing 89 open-sourced AIMIEs, we reveal the landscape of AIMIEs, report the evolution and evasiveness of abused image hosting APIs from reputable companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Bytedance, and identify real-world abused images uploaded through those AIMIEs. In addition, we propose a tool, called Viola, to detect vulnerable image hosting modules (IHMs) in the wild. We find 477 vulnerable IHM upload APIs associated with 338 web services, which integrated vulnerable IHMs, and 207 victim FQDNs. The highest-ranked domain with vulnerable web service is baidu.com, followed by bilibili.com and 163.com. We have reported abused and vulnerable IHM upload APIs and received acknowledgments from 69 of them by the time of paper submission.
There are many different types of security threats to individual, business and government enterprises. Although there are efforts to ensure that technologies work to the best levels, there are still several challenges. Keeping the security of the enterprise system in view, security designers have introduced multiple security perimeters like firewalls and threat detection and response (TDR) systems. These frameworks directly contribute to detecting and defending any unwanted action into the system. The objective of this paper is to survey the role and strategies of deception in cyberattack. A detailed discussion of technologies and tools for combating unwanted adversary actions are presented.
Our motivation for this study is to provide new information to a researcher based on our field of study: Networking Systems. This is because Cyber crime is becoming very widespread and it is imperative to improve measures used to counteract such threats. There are various research gaps based on awareness of cyber security, and different methods used in enhancing and troubleshooting network security. This research area can otter many opportunities in which justice can be served, creating awareness, making cyber space a more secure area and creating a new business niche based on security. Hence, for our study on Network Security, we read through 24 research papers published between 2008 to 2014. These documents were retrieved online from CAIDA and IEEE, along with other computer journals and articles. The 24 research papers were then summarized into 7 different research gaps to help enlighten a researcher in the topic of Network Security. Therefore, researchers can then take the initiatives to come up with solutions to the issues raised in this paper.
One of the reasons for state-level intrusion may be attributed to a government ensuring the safety and security of its territory which includes cyberspace. The existing international law prohibits state-level cyber intrusion that constitutes an intervention, threat of or use of force or armed attack. International lawyers must interpret which cyber intrusion falls under international law. In the latter respect, the Tallinn Manual on the International Law applicable to Cyber Warfare is a valuable tool as it provides guidelines in such determination. The discussion will however show that establishing the type of intrusion is not easy as cognizance must be taken of the doctrinal law as outlined in the international law and interpreted by international lawyers and state practice which refers to how nation-states react to intrusion. The possibility of excessive state-level intrusion exists. Mass surveillance of other states may for example illustrate an imbalance between states as some states have the technical ability to dominate cyberspace to advance their own interests and motives. Finding legal solutions to state-level cyber intrusion under the present international law are uncertain. Cyberspace governance can only be achieved under the international law by the involvement of all states on an equal basis to ensure transparency and trust, with the latter being tenuous at present. A code of conduct for cyberspace may limit excessive state-level intrusion within the ambit of the international law. The multinational Convention on Cybercrime of 2001 should be re-evaluated to establish whether it will attain global recognition. In order to address the challenges in the short term a code of conduct in cyberspace should be negotiated, whilst a cybercrime treaty would be required to address challenges over the long term. State-level intrusion ultimately involves international politics and national foreign policy, both of which could be murky at times to negotiate.
Drive-by downloads are the preferred distribution vector for many malware families. In the drive-by ecosystem, many exploit servers run the same exploit kit and it is a challenge understanding whether the exploit server is part of a larger operation. In this paper, we propose a technique to identify exploit servers managed by the same organization. We collect over time how exploit servers are configured, which exploits they use, and what malware they distribute, grouping servers with similar configurations into operations. Our operational analysis reveals that although individual exploit servers have a median lifetime of 16 h, long-lived operations exist that operate for several months. To sustain long-lived operations, miscreants are turning to the cloud, with 60 % of the exploit servers hosted by specialized cloud hosting services. We also observe operations that distribute multiple malware families and that pay-per-install affiliate programs are managing exploit servers for their affiliates to convert traffic into installations. Furthermore, we analyze the exploit polymorphism problem, measuring the repacking rate for different exploit types. To understand how difficult is to takedown exploit servers, we analyze the abuse reporting process and issue abuse reports for 19 long-lived servers. We describe the interaction with ISPs and hosting providers and monitor the result of the report. We find that 61 % of the reports are not even acknowledged. On average, an exploit server still lives for 4.3 days after a report. Finally, we detail the Malicia dataset we have collected and are making available to other researchers.
The volume of data for cybercrime investigation keeps growing at unprecedented rates and creating a quandary for law enforcement agencies. This brings a great challenge for law enforcement agencies. It requires the sincere examination of all available data volumes at crime scene or in lab to present digital evidence in a court of law. In order to maintain the integrity and validity of digital evidence, investigators must establish a process model that can provide a quick response at scene. This paper illustrates the novel TEAR-phase application of THOR dimensions to digital forensics. It facilitates the efficiency and effectiveness of constructing a clear investigation.
Cyber crime and terrorism is an international problem which does not respect national borders. Cyber criminals operate from relatively safe territories beyond the easy reach of the law enforcement agencies of the countries in which their victims reside. Collaboration between governments, intelligence agencies and law enforcement officers is critical to prosecuting cybercrime, and new organizations have been created to enable this. However, this co-operation seems to have run into roadblocks by the leak of large scale national level data snooping secrets by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The paper attempts to derive insights from ongoing initiatives reported in open source and recommend options available to charter the path for sustainable international cooperation in evolving secure cyber infrastructure.
Online gambling has exploded into a substantial global industry over the past two decades. Despite its prosperity, online gambling is explicitly prohibited or restricted in most countries due to social problems it caused. This has given rise to black markets of illegal online gambling (IOG) which are replete with criminal potential. To help criminal investigators find key members of an IOG organization and fight against them, in this study, we propose an ensemble learning approach named EC4PRR to automatically identify the roles that IOG participants play in their ecosystem. We extract two categories of features, i.e., transaction statistical features (TSF) and network structural features (NSF), from monetary transaction data effectively represent participants. Since the number of participants in different roles is typically unbalanced, we train the classifier with a combination of under-sampling and ensemble learning strategies to reduce the impact of imbalanced training data. Experiments were carried out with real-world case data. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed features as well as the feasibility of EC4PRR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose Fraud is not a new offence. However, the recent evolution and proliferation of technologies (predominantly the internet) has seen offenders increasingly use virtual environments to target and defraud victims worldwide. Several studies have examined the ways that fraud is perpetrated with a clear demarcation between terrestrial and cyber offences. However, with moves towards the notion of a digital society and recognition that technology is increasingly embedded across all aspects of our lives, it is important to consider if there is any advantage in categorising fraud against the type of environment it is perpetrated in. This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the perceived utility of differentiating online and offline fraud offences. It is based upon the insights of thirty-one professionals who work within the fraud justice network across London, UK and Toronto, Canada. Findings It highlights both the realities faced by professionals in seeking to ether maintain or collapse such a differentiation in their everyday jobs and the potential benefits and challenges that result. Practical implications - Overall, the paper argues that the majority of professionals did not feel a distinction was necessary and instead felt that an arbitrary divide was instead a hindrance to their activities. However, while not useful on a practical front, there was perceived benefit regarding government, funding and the media. The implications of this moving forward are considered. Originality/value This paper provides new insights into how fraud justice network professionals understand the distinction between fraud offences perpetrated across both online and offline environments.
Control over most of the world's data including national security, criminal investigations, medical secrets, intellectual property, and a host of other important rights and responsibilities is governed by a paradigm that is conducted in the Internet cloud. The Google cyber-attacks illustrate the vulnerability of information stored in the cloud, a fact that has led to increased security, online surveillance, and private sector collaboration with government agencies to prevent the increasing potential for catastrophic loss and global terrorism. In the future, more of our lives will be based in the cloud. Recently, Microsoft's CEO stated that 90 percent of Microsoft's engineers are doing things that are entirely cloud based or cloud-inspired. Enterprises using the cloud must be aware of the risks and how to prevent them before serious damage is incurred. Based on empirical research, and an analysis of international and national legal regimes, case decisions, and forensic case analysis, the paper will explore the challenges of reaching into the cloud and the proactive measures that will be necessary to improve legal certainty in the global electronic marketplace. The paper then considers the international and national frameworks necessary for control over the predators in the cloud and the nature and type of evidentiary and jurisdictional issues that may arise in courts of law and tribunals around the globe. The reality of creating legal institutions to police the cloud, establishing international legal and regulatory frameworks, codifying custom and usage, and harmonizing the laws will be examined and critically analyzed based on recent case decisions, government policies and law enforcement efforts to combat cloud crime. Alternatives will be offered including frameworks that recommend treaties, policies, guidelines and collaborations to protect the security of the cloud, while devising mechanisms to catch, punish and deter the thieves that are turning the white clouds into gray.
With the development of the Internet, network security has aroused people's attention. It can be said that a secure network environment is a basis for the rapid and sound development of the Internet. Phishing is an essential class of cybercriminals which is a malicious act of tricking users into clicking on phishing links, stealing user information, and ultimately using user data to fake logging in with related accounts to steal funds. Network security is an iterative issue of attack and defense. The methods of phishing and the technology of phishing detection are constantly being updated. Traditional methods for identifying phishing links rely on blacklists and whitelists, but this cannot identify new phishing links. Therefore, we need to solve how to predict whether a newly emerging link is a phishing website and improve the accuracy of the prediction. With the maturity of machine learning technology, prediction has become a vital ability. This paper offers a state-of-the-art survey on methods for phishing website detection. It starts with the life cycle of phishing, introduces common anti-phishing methods, mainly focuses on the method of identifying phishing links, and has an in-depth understanding of machine learning-based solutions, including data collection, feature extraction, modeling, and evaluation performance. This paper provides a detailed comparison of various solutions for phishing website detection.
"Numerous studies have been concerned with developing new authorship recognition systems to address the increasing rates of cybercrimes associated with the anonymous nature of social media platforms, which still offer the opportunity for the users not to reveal their true identities. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to identify the real authors of social media's offensive and inappropriate content. These contents are usually very short; therefore, it is challenging for stylometric authorship systems to assign controversial texts to their real authors based on the salient and distinctive linguistic features and patterns within these contents. This research introduces a new stylometric authorship system that considers both the shortness of data and the peculiar linguistic properties of Arabic. A corpus of 20, 357 tweets from 134 Twitter users. A document clustering based on Document Index Graph (DIG) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common linguistic features. A comparative analysis using Vector Space Clustering (VSC) model based on the Bag of Words (BOW) model, conventionally used in authorship recognition applications, was used. Results indicate that the proposed system is more accurate than other standard authorship systems mainly based on vector space clustering methods. It was also clear that the model had the advantage of providing complete information about the documents and the degree of overlap between every pair of documents, which was useful in determining the similarity between documents."
The use of IT technology for the planning and implementation of illegal activities has been gaining ground in recent years. Nowadays, through the web and the social media, it is possible not only to divulge advertising for the disclosure of illicit activities, but also to take action that in the past needed to have people in place and at the moment the activity took place. In fact, this phenomenon allows criminals to be less exposed to the risk of being discovered. Furthermore, the technology tends to encourage international collaborations, which makes the process of identifying illegal activities even more complex because of the lack of adequate tools that can operate effectively by considering multi-cultural aspects. Consequently, this evolving phenomenon towards cyber-crime requires new models and analysis techniques to address these challenges. In this context, the paper proposes an approach based on a multi-language model that aims to support the identification of suspicious users on social networks. It exploits the effectiveness of web translation services along with specific stand-alone libraries for normalizing user profiles in a common language. In addition, different text analysis techniques are combined for supporting the user profiles evaluation. The proposed approach is exemplified through a case study by analyzing Twitter users profile by showing step by step the overall process and related results.
The ability to gain unauthorized access to computer systems to engage in espionage and data theft poses a massive threat to individuals worldwide. There has been minimal focus, however, on the role of malicious software, or malware, which can automate this process. This study examined the macro-correlates of malware infection at the national level by using an open repository of known malware infections and utilizing a routine activities framework. Negative inflated binomial models for counts indicated that nations with greater technological infrastructure, more political freedoms, and with less organized crime financial impact were more likely to report malware infections. The number of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in a nation was not significantly related with reported malware infection. The implications of the study for the understanding of malware infection, routine activity theory, and target-hardening strategies are discussed.
"The article analyzes the effects of changes in keeping and accessing data from public registers because of digitalization as well as the threats related thereto. The article also discusses the definition of public register and the consequences of qualifying a specific resource as a public register. Selected problems of providing cybersecurity of registers in Poland have been analyzed; these are related to electronic access to registers, lack of interoperability or statutory indication of entities responsible for an ICT system that supports registers as well as ensuring the security of registers. According to the conducted studies, it is expedient to formulate and specify publicpublic tasks that address public registers as well as assign performance of them to specific entities. That which should positively affect the protection of public registers against cyberattacks is determining entities which are to be responsible for this as well as specifying obligations related to: preparing data model diagrams and implementing them in the data model in ICT systems; preparing, updating and developing ICT systems in which registers are maintained, rules and scope of providing access to data, securing data against loss, change, unauthorized access. The aim should also be to reduce dispersion and non standardization of regulations that adversely affect the protection level of certain data (standardization of rules and the scope of data that are to be made available to the public)."
Over the past four decades, research on hackers has widely propagated within the social sciences. Although this area of scholarship yields rich insight into the interpersonal dynamics of hackers, research on the unique ecosystems they create and inhabit is scant in comparison. The current study aims to offer a more complete assessment of hackers' ecosystems by incorporating the group affiliations which link hackers to one another. Using 12 months of archived website defacement data containing individuals' self-reported group affiliations alongside their hacking activities, the study reconstructs the social network of hacker groups over time. Findings reveal the illicit ecosystem to be loosely connected, yet densely clustered around a few central groups. The ecosystem also maintained its network features across the observation period with no sign of structural degradation. These findings corroborate extant research on the social environments of hackers, offer an innovative look into the illicit ecosystem of website defacers, and serve as a steppingstone to extend investigations of criminal behavior to the group-level.
Cyberscams, such as romance scams, are prevalent and costly online hazards in the general community. People with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) may be particularly vulnerable and have greater difficulty recovering from the resultant emotional and financial hardships. In order to build capacity in the neurorehabilitation sector, it is necessary to determine whether clinicians currently encounter this issue and what prevention and intervention approaches have been found effective. This scoping study aimed to explore clinicians' exposure to and experiences with cyberscams in their adult clients with ABI. Method: Participants were clinicians recruited from multidisciplinary networks across Australia and New Zealand. Eligible participants (n = 101) completed an online customised survey. Results: More than half (53.46%) the participants had one or more clients affected by cyberscams, predominantly romance scams. Cognitive impairments and loneliness were reportedly associated with increased vulnerability. Cyberscams impacted treatment provision and were emotionally challenging for participants. No highly effective interventions were identified. Conclusions: These findings indicate that cyberscams are a clinical issue relevant to neurorehabilitation providers, with prevalence studies now required. The lack of effective interventions identified underscores the need for the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches to ultimately help people with ABI safely participate in online life.
Cybercrime has increased considerably over the past years, emphasizing the need for efficient investigations. Currently, some tools and processes are manual and lead to long and inaccurate investigations. This report provides a descriptive review of the of published research in the field of cyber forensics, in order to identify current practices, challenges and the adoption of automation. A pragmatist approach was taken to accommodate the multitude of theories and views presented in the literature. The research illustrates how the use of technology could simplify an investigators task and solving difficulties that currently exist in cyber forensics. The paper concludes in motivating for the use of automated practices in the cyber forensic process.
Maximum research work on abusive text detection is in the English language and some of these are to detect offensive text. But in Bangla language, a few work is found. Detecting abusive text in Bangla language will be useful for preventing cybercrime such as online harassment, blackmailing and cyber bullying which are becoming the main concern in Bangladesh nowadays. Our goal is to detect abusive Bangla comments which are collected from various social sites where people share their sentiment, opinions, views etc. in this paper. We proposed a root level algorithm to detect abusive text and also proposed unigram string features to get a better result.
The current study employs group-based trajectory modeling to assess the longitudinal attack patterns of new hackers involved in website defacement. Specifically, we track the activity of 241 emergent hackers for one year following their first verified website defacement. In doing so, we find four distinct criminal trajectories: low threat (29.0%), naturally desisting (26.5%), increasingly prolific (22.3%), and persistent threat (22.1%). Hackers classified as low threats engage in few defacements, whereas persistent threats engage in high-frequency attacks. Those labeled as naturally desisting begin their careers with velocity but become less prolific with time. Conversely, those classified as increasingly prolific engage in more attacks as they advance in their criminal careers. Using a series of regression models, we find that digital artifacts and open-source intelligence are predictive of group involvement. The findings presented in this study contribute to our theoretical understanding of the developmental trajectories of hackers, while providing valuable insights in fostering targeted intervention strategies aimed at effectively mitigating and preventing cyber-attacks.
The article introduces a new meaning of the acronym M.A.D. (Mutually Assured Destruction) in the field of security. From the original connection with nuclear issues, its use is moving to the area of cyberspace. The text introduces the basic division of domains important for human activities. It explains their importance in terms of undeniable usability and availability for mankind, at the same time, it draws attention to their vulnerability and the need to ensure their protection. It deals in more details with the new fifth domain - cyberspace. In this context, security threats are mentioned and some legal aspects are indicated.
Cybercrime has become an increasing concern for consumers in the United States and internationally. In recent years, cybercrimes in the healthcare industry have drastically increased in type, impact, and frequency. These attacks have negatively impacted patient privacy, the ability of providers to deliver care, and the security of healthcare organizations. Nurses are uniquely positioned to help protect against and report cybercrimes because they are one of the largest employed populations in the healthcare industry and they are on the front line of patient care and healthcare technology use. This article discusses the main concerns of cybersecurity in healthcare, the nurse's role in preventing and managing cyber security, and recommendations for nurses, educators, and regulators.
The amazing development witnessed by the world in all fields, especially in the field of technology, the rapid spread of modern means of communication, and its exploitation of the Internet in transactions between individuals and companies, has in turn led to the emergence of new crimes that were not known before. Crimes were traditional and typical, but in this era, crimes have evolved according to the development of their means, and criminals have become They use the Internet as an arena to enforce their crimes and harm users using innovative means imposed by modern technology, which led to the creation of serious damages that did not exist before such as disclosure of trade secrets, hacking personal computers and violating the privacy of individuals. Even worse, it caused catastrophic damage, these methods used are fraudulent and difficult to detect and cause severe damage to their victims and are known as a supply chain attack and this crime is a few of the very modern crimes that threaten national security. Is national legislation really capable of confronting these modern crimes and compensating those affected by them? Are the existing rules applicable to the crime of supply chain attack? This is what we will illustrate through our research hopefully
Social engineering, or the use of deception to circumvent information security measures, has become a significant concern for organizations. Many organizations have implemented information security policies to mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks. This study uses a grounded theory-based approach to examine qualitative interviews with security auditors, IT security professionals, and social engineers (n = 54) to thematically catalog their insights on developing and supporting security policies. Results indicate that effective IT security policies are (1) properly communicated, (2) tested to find gaps in policy directives and their implementation, (3) buttressed by tools to facilitate good security decision-making among members, (4) written simply and concisely while being kept up-to-date, (5) supported through adequate staffing and expertise, (6) supported by organizational leadership, and (7) accompanied by an organizational structure which allows for policy to be overseen and implemented consistently.
This study aims at knowing both the level of information security awareness in the use of social media among female secondary school students in Makkah Al-Mukarramah, and the procedures that students follow when exposed to hacking or other security problems. The study relied on the descriptive survey approach. The results showed a high percentage of social media use among the study sample, and the most used applications by the students are snapchat and Instagram applications successively. In fact, 48% of the study sample have awareness of information security, the majority of the students memorize the password in the devices, most of them do not change them, and they have knowledge of fake gates and social engineering. However, their knowledge of electronic hacking is weak, and students do not share passwords with anyone at a rate of 67%. At the same time, they do not update passwords. Moreover, most of the procedures followed by students when exposed to theft and hacking is to change the e-mail data and the password, and the results varied apart from that, which reflects the weak awareness of the students and the weakness of procedures related to information security. The study recommends the necessity to raise awareness and education of the importance of information security and safety, especially in light of what the world faces from data electronic attacks and hackings of electronic applications.
The rapid increase in the use of cloud computing has led it to become a new arena for cybercrime. Since cloud environments are, to some extent, a new field for digital forensics, a number of technical, legal and organisational challenges have been raised. Although security and digital forensics share the same concerns, when an attack occurs, the fields of security and digital forensics are considered different disciplines. This paper argues that cloud security and digital forensics in cloud environments are converging fields. As a result, unifying security and forensics by being forensically ready and including digital forensics aspects in security mechanisms would enhance the security level in cloud computing, increase forensic capabilities and prepare organizations for any potential attack.
Contemporary computer and networking technologies have expanded the scope and scale of deceptions worldwide. Among hackers, security practitioners, and other technologists, ruses designed to gain access to otherwise secure information or computer systems are often referred to as social engineering. To date, little research has explored the creation of fabrications from the perspective of social engineers. The current study addresses this gap by examining the attributes that social engineers ascribe to successful and effective social engineering deceptions through a grounded theory analysis of interviews with social engineers (n = 37). Results reveal twelve characteristics of effective social engineers according to participants-findings which indicate that perpetrators consider social context, assumptions about human nature, the complexities of social networks, the role of social conventions, and the limitations of human processing and reasoning in the execution of their deceptions. The study concludes by considering the theoretical implications of the results and advancing propositions to guide future criminological research on social engineering, fraud, and deception more generally.
"Among the most treasured characteristics of the Internet is arguably its default technical architecture that facilitates online anonymity. This feature is most commonly cherished by Internet users as they are empowered to publish online content anonymously; or in the alternative to conceal their true identities behind fictitious names (pseudonyms). Anonymity is believed to have bolstered freedom of speech as any speakers could freely express their ideas or personal views in the cyber world without the fear of being identified and retaliated. Unfortunately, anonymity poses new challenges to law enforcement agencies as well as victims of cyber-crimes as they would find it difficult to trace and identify the culprits. For that reason, the Malaysian legislature has in 2012 passed a new law, section 114A of the Evidence Act 1950 that has the effect of shifting the burden of proof on the alleged offenders to prove his innocence. The passing of this controversial provision has led to heated debates between the government and human right defenders on the ground that such law seems to be very oppressive and could be easily manipulated by prosecutors in criminal cases as well as claimants in civil suits. By referring to reported cases and judicial decisions, this paper attempts to scrutinize in details section 114A of the Evidence Act 1950 and its implications on the legal system in the country; and ultimately to lend some assistance in unravelling the dispute between the proponents and opponents of the new law."
Cryptomarkets are online marketplaces that are part of the Dark Web and mainly devoted to the sale of illicit drugs. They combine tools to ensure anonymity of participants with the delivery of products by mail to enable the development of illicit drug trafficking. Using data collected on eight cryptomarkets, this study provides an overview of the Canadian illicit drug market. It seeks to inform about the most prevalent illicit drugs vendors offer for sale and preferred destination countries. Moreover, the research gives an insight into the structure and organisation of distribution networks existing online. In particular, we provide information about how vendors are diversifying and replicating across marketplaces. We inform on the number of listings each vendor manages, the number of cryptomarkets they are active on and the products they offer. This research demonstrates the importance of online marketplaces in the context of illicit drug trafficking. It shows how the analysis of data available online may elicit knowledge on criminal activities. Such knowledge is mandatory to design efficient policy for monitoring or repressive purposes against anonymous marketplaces. Nevertheless, trafficking on Dark Net markets is difficult to analyse based only on digital data. A more holistic approach for investigating this crime problem should be developed. This should rely on a combined use and interpretation of digital and physical data within a single collaborative intelligence model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
Phishing refers to cybercrime that use social engineering and technical subterfuge techniques to fool online users into revealing sensitive information such as username, password, bank account number or social security number. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to defend zero-day phishing attacks. Our proposed approach is a combination of whitelist and visual similarity based techniques. We use computer vision technique called SURF detector to extract discriminative key point features from both suspicious and targeted websites. Then they are used for computing similarity degree between the legitimate and suspicious pages. Our proposed solution is efficient, covers a wide range of websites phishing attacks and results in less false positive rate.
The emergence of threats of attacks in cyberspace requires from all governmental or non-governmental security measures and protection of critical infrastructures are vulnerable to these means. Therefore to find solutions, including training and education of computer users in the XXI century is imminent. E-Learning is required to be developed and generalized to all computer users a new security culture and a new e-cyber security competence. Why is needed to develop a new e-cyber security competence because, in 2014 we are talking about e-crime, e-terrorism or e-war in cyberspace. E-cyber security culture must include training/awareness/education organizational competence users (be they experts, business people or simply beneficiaries ICT) data protection, proper use of procedures for the use of cyberspace. In other words it is about the formation of ethical and moral skills that enable citizens, according to their aspirations and belonging to a modern and civilized society. The problem to be addressed in other areas such as economic security, social, food, environmental, industrial, military, etc. Today, the cyberspace identified four major threats: spam unsolicited e-mail messages that users upload mailboxes worldwide, bugs undiscovered software errors that lead to data corruption and security vulnerabilities, attacks type denial of services users are deprived of resources and services (personal 1-1DD or the entire network bandwidth) and malicious software - viruses, worms, trojans and spyware programmes. Therefore e-Learning could be a good option in order to develop new cyber security skills of the users in a variety of ways and new e-Learning technologies could be integrated into the mainstream of education and training programmes.
Healthcare organizations are a popular target for cybercrime due to its critical and vulnerable infrastructure. The IT threat detection system (ITDS), described in this work, is an intelligent system that improves the incident detection by providing network monitoring and intrusion detection by means of a machine learning approach. Different machine learning techniques were studied in public datasets, and then fine-tuned with healthcare data. Thus, the main contribution of this work is a plug and play toolkit built for hospitals and which allow them to detect security events. Another relevant outcome of this work is a real hospital ecosystem that allows the simulation and test of security tools in a hospital environment without sacrificing its availability.
In light of the rapid development of technology and the increase in the number of users of the Internet via computers and smart devices, cybercrimes impact on enterprises, organizations, governments and individuals has been significant. Researches and reports on the impact of cybercrime and methods of prevention and protection are been introduced regularly. However, the majority focuses on the impact on organizations and governments. This paper aims to use a survey methodology in order to highlights the impact of cybercrimes on the individuals in Saudi Arabia and measure the awareness of cybersecurity among individuals. In addition, this research aims to investigate the common cybercrimes which target the individuals in Saudi Arabia and the countermeasure taken by them.
The rapid increase of Internet access and use of smart digital technologies create new attack techniques for cybercrime to ordinary users and organizations. Malware is one of the most dangerous security threats in Internet today. In order to deal with the malware attack, new techniques have been developed to detect malware from our computer systems. In this paper, we first present an overview of the different types of malware programs used by the hackers to penetrate into computer systems and mobile phones for destroying, changing or stealing personal information from ordinary users. We then present an in-depth analysis and comparison of most recently proposed malware detection techniques based on deep learning in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of users data.
In this globalization era, cybercrime has been entering every aspect through internet network. The development of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is being studied deeply to solve the problem. There are several classifier algorithms for Intrusion Detection System such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). In this study, we will compare proposed model using both Support Vector Machine and Fuzzy C-Means to find a better result that increase accuracy of the network attacks. KDD Cup 1999 will be used to evaluate which algorithms work best. The results are very encouraging and show that SVM and FCM can be a useful tool for intrusion detection system. We found that SVM achieved 94.43% average accuracy rate while FCM achieved 95.09% average accuracy rate.
"The current global pandemic occasioned by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been attributed, partially, to the growing range of cyber vises within the cyber ecosystem. One area of such impact is the increasing tendencies of cyber-bullying among students. Cyberbullying -the act of subjugating others using a cyber platform- is a growing concern among educators, especially in High-Schools. Whilst studies have been carried out towards understanding this menace, the approach towards identifying indicators of cyberbullying is largely missing in the literature. To address this research gap, this study proposed a cyberbullying framework based on the identification of some observable behavioral indicators. Using a self-administered measurement instrument from 30-respondents, the study observed the probability of a cyberbully construct, as a potential measure of the presence of cyberbullying; a probability that has been largely ignored in extant literature. This observation presents a veritable tool for the development of an active and integrated learning platform void of abuse among students. Furthermore, within the cyber education ecosystem, a cyberbullying construct would provide a mechanism for the development of an appropriate online learning platform, which would be useful to the information system and cyber education research communities."
Private organizations suffer great losses due to cybersecurity incidents, and they invest increasing resources to prevent attacks, but little is known about the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures for prevention. Based on the framework of Routine Activity Theory, this paper analyzes the impact of companies' online activities and cybersecurity measures on victimization. Our analysis of the UK Cybersecurity Breaches Survey shows that the most promising ways to minimize cyber-attacks and their impacts is to invest in in-house cybersecurity human resources and enhance the employees' online self-protection by providing cybersecurity training, rather than just basic software protection and guidance about strong passwords.
The smart devices have been used in the most major domain like the healthcare, transportation, smart home, smart city and more. However, this technology has been exposed to many vulnerabilities, which may lead to cybercrime through the devices. With the IoT constraints and low-security mechanisms applied, the device could be easily been attacked, treated and exploited by cyber criminals where the smart devices could provide wrong data where it can lead to wrong interpretation and actuation to the legitimate users. To comply with the IoT characteristics, two approaches towards of having the investigation for IoT forensic is proposed by emphasizing the pre-investigation phase and implementing the real-time investigation to ensure the data and potential evidence is collected and preserved throughout the investigation.
Due to recent arise of cybercrime, importance of cyher security is highlighted more than ever. NIST has created Cryptographic Module Validation Program, namely CMVP, to validate security level of cryptographic modules for the United States Federal agencies: indeed, many are achieving the validation. According to the program, operating environments for any specific cryptographic module are fixed. In other words, running validated module in other software environment is strictly prohibited. However, this paper asserts that it is possible for a C based module to operate in Java environment without loss of validation as long as the module is running on a verified environment. We expect this paper to help saving great amount of time and costs for developing another cryptographic module for the same operating purpose.
Advances in technology have led to the transformation of societies, cultures, behaviours, economy and security. In this regard, the internet and its diverse applications provide a vital means of recruitment, propaganda and financing for terrorist organisations. In this chapter, the financial activities of terrorists and the opportunities emerging in the online environment are examined, and the question of how the internet is used as a medium for funding terrorism is answered. The main argument is that terrorists, similar to criminals, are using opportunities provided by the internet effectively and creatively for meeting part of their financial requirements.
Digital evidence has a different meaning from physical evidence, but even though it is different, both are a unity of evidence that supports each other in the investigation process. Unfortunately, laws and regulations generally have not been oriented to the terminology of digital evidence that should be. It becomes a research challenge in how the handling of digital evidence also gets the same treatment as physical evidence. For this reason, technical studies are needed to support the application of law and regulations for digital evidence handling. This article provides a solution in the form of digital evidence cabinets as a framework to support the centralization of digital evidence that following the applicable regulations of procedures for the management of evidence in the territory of Indonesia. This concept can translate the centralization of digital evidence through the analogy of physical cabinet and the interpretation of cabinet, rack, bags, and evidence unit with types of criminals, list of crimes, list of crime scenes and list of digital evidence at one crime scene.
"Currently, numerous types of cybercrime are organized through the internet. Hence, this study mainly focuses on phishing attacks. Although phishing was first used in 1996, it has become the most severe and dangerous cybercrime on the internet. Phishing utilizes email distortion as its underlying mechanism for tricky correspondences, followed by mock sites, to obtain the required data from people in question. Different studies have presented their work on the precaution, identification, and knowledge of phishing attacks; however, there is currently no complete and proper solution for frustrating them. Therefore, machine learning plays a vital role in defending against cybercrimes involving phishing attacks. The proposed study is based on the phishing URL-based dataset extracted from the famous dataset repository, which consists of phishing and legitimate URL attributes collected from 11000+ website datasets in vector form. After preprocessing, many machine learning algorithms have been applied and designed to prevent phishing URLs and provide protection to the user. This study uses machine learning models such as decision tree (DT), linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), gradient boosting classifier (GBM), K-neighbors classifier (KNN), support vector classifier (SVC), and proposed hybrid LSD model, which is a combination of logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision tree (LR+SVC+DT) with soft and hard voting, to defend against phishing attacks with high accuracy and efficiency. The canopy feature selection technique with cross fold valoidation and Grid Search Hyperparameter Optimization techniques are used with proposed LSD model. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed approach, different evaluation parameters were adopted, such as the precision, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and specificity, to illustrate the effects and efficiency of the models. The results of the comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the other models and achieves the best results."
The recent surge of Ethereum in prominence has made it an attractive target for various kinds of crypto crimes. Phishing scams, for example, are an increasingly prevalent cybercrime in which malicious users attempt to steal funds from a user's crypto wallet. This research investigates the effects of network architectural features as well as the temporal aspects of user activities on the performance of detecting phishing users on the Ethereum transaction network. We employ traditional machine learning algorithms to evaluate our model on real-world Ethereum transaction data. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed features identify phishing accounts efficiently and outperform the baseline models by 4% in Recall and 5% in F1-score.
In this work, on the basis of a brief analysis of the fundamental factors of the evolution of criminal manifestations in the digital space, measures to leveling the consequences of cybercrime are considered. The research focuses on a certain disproportionate disconnecting of counteraction to digital crime at the international and national levels. The authors attempted to integrate the definition of digital neglect into the information and communication use in order to explain the processes occurring in the digital environment, including indirectly generated by the actions of digital criminals. The problem of a psychological nature is analyzed - immersion into a digital environment, which is a catalyst of the denial of traditional culture and values, destructive disharmony of personality and society.
The expansion and democratization of the digital world coupled with the effect of the Internet globalization, has allowed individuals, countries, states and companies to interconnect and interact at incidence levels never previously imagined. Cybercrime, in turn, is unfortunately one the negative aspects of this rapid global interconnection expansion. We often find malicious individuals and/or groups aiming to undermine the integrity of Information Systems for either financial gain or to serve a cause. Our study investigates and proposes a hybrid data mining methodology in order to detect abnormal behavior that could potentially threaten the security of an Information System, in a simple way that is understandable to all involved parties, whether they are security experts or standard users.
With the development of network, web forensics is becoming more and more important due to the rampant cybercrime. In this paper, a forensics method of web browsing behavior based on association rule mining is presented. The method aims at providing the necessary data support to build the behavior pattern library for investigation. The records of the user's browsing history are collected to be analyzed. The obtained original data are pretreated to transactional data which are suitable for association rule mining. Frequent browsing time and frequent web browsing sequences are obtained from the transactional data by Apriori algorithm. The mining results are helpful for identification and recognition of anonymous or suspicious web browsing behavior patterns.
The use of the internet has become a basic need for many across the globe. The situation is very much the same for the youth in many countries like Saudi Arabia who have grown up surrounded and accessing the internet. This demographic, however, is at an increased risk of falling as victims to cybercrime because of a low level of technical awareness. This review looks at the level of technical awareness of internet use in 3 different countries which include the USA, South Africa, and New Zealand. The review will compare the situation in these nations with those in KSA. Based on the review and comparisons, recommendations are made for culturally and socially acceptable e-Safety awareness of Saudi youths.
Cloud storage services are subject to exploitation by cyber offenders for criminal purposes. It will enhance the challenge of collecting and analyzing digital evidence in cybercrime investigation. This study covers general theories of computer forensics and surveys the cloud storage forensics of file metadata. This study evaluates the correction and effectiveness of date-time stamps, and presents a novel collection evidence framework, which is based on ISO/IEC 27037:2012 standard. This novel framework represents an essential contribution toward cloud storage forensics, and helps us discover further knowledge or information to improve the correction and effectiveness on date-time stamps in a cloud storage device. As a result, our work will help computer forensic examiners evaluate evidence with confidence in the cloud age.
Online social networking platforms have become a common choice for people to communicate with friends, relatives, or business partners. This allows sharing life achievement, success, and much more. In parallel, it also invited hidden issues such as web-spamming, cyberbullying, cybercrime, and others. This paper addresses the issue of cyberbullying using an ensemble machine learning model. The complete experiment works in two phases: firstly, k-nearest neighbour, logistic regression and, decision tree classifiers are used to detect the bullying post. Secondly, the prediction outcomes of these classifiers are passed to a voting-based ensemble learning model for the predictions. The experimental outcomes confirmed that the ensemble model is detecting bullying posts with good accuracy.
Smart televisions have become the standard for televisions. These devices are fully functioning computers. Smart TV's can be the target of cybercrimes such as computer viruses, ransomware, and remote access Trojans. It is also possible for a smart TV to the source of a cybercrime, or a repository of evidence in a crime, including images and videos. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology for conducting smart TV forensics. This paper presents a method that is forensically sound, and readily actionable by a wide range of forensic examiners. The method presented here does not require specialized equipment, nor extensive engineering training. Furthermore, the current study proposes both a primary and alternative method.
Connected machines become more vulnerable to malware infections which potentially cause them to be controlled as part of a botnet for cybercrime activities. Prompt detection of infected machines is required for protecting local networks and infrastructure as well as reducing the impact of botnets. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning techniques involving multi-layer perceptrons and decision trees on network traffic analysis for the detection of botnet traffic. We enhance components of an existing detection framework with these techniques to automate its processes and improve performance at the same time. Our experiments indicate that the modifications successfully improved the overall performance of botnet traffic detection in both supervised and semi-supervised manners.
In the modern world, cyber societies are full of complications. The Internet has brought so many convenient services to our society but Internet is also a mine field. Mass surveillance from smart phone to PC, from automated car to smart television, any online device seems could be turn to privacy breach toolkit. In order to follow the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), protect privacy data, including PII (Personally Identifiable Information), against Cyberstalking and many other cybercrime challenges, a novel Digital Forensics Model served for Smart City Automated Vehicles has been developed working on investigating AAV (Autonomous Automated Vehicle) cases. The proposed development is reported to Big Data 2017. Here, we report the update for discussions.
This article intends to describe the implementation of e-government in recent era in managing public services and early problem preventions as part of political affairs. Recently, there have been two most advanced countries in e-government service namely South Korea as the first rank and Singapore as the tenth world rank. For the contribution to my own country, I would like to write this article based on Indonesia's figure of e-government compare to Singapore as the neighbour and the tenth world e-government rank based on rights to information access. Thus the discussion will include human rights and the rights concept to information access, e-government conception, e-government in Singapore and Indonesia, personal privileges security, the impacts of e-government, cybercrime and law enforcement.
Comprehensive digitization leads to new challenges because of cybercrime and related security counter-measures. There is no doubt that this will fundamentally affect our lives and is leading to an increase in the importance of information security (IS). However, technology solutions alone are not sufficient to ensure IS countermeasures. The human side of security is important to protect organizational assets like user information and systems. The paper illustrates these relationships in terms of information security awareness (ISA), examining its goals and the factors influencing it through the systematic analysis and review of scientific literature and the transfer of scientific knowledge for practical purposes. We reviewed the publications of leading academic journals in the field of IS over the past decade.
To design preventive policy measures for email phishing, it is helpful to be aware of the phishing schemes and trends that are currently applied. How phishing schemes and patterns emerge and adapt is an ongoing field of study. Existing phishing works already reveal a rich set of phishing schemes, patterns, and trends that provide insight into the mechanisms used. However, there seems to be limited knowledge about how email phishing is affected in periods of social disturbance, such as COVID-19 in which phishing numbers have quadrupled. Therefore, we investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic influences the phishing emails sent during the first year of the pandemic. The email content (header data and html body, excl. attachments) is evaluated to assess how the pandemic influences the topics of phishing emails over time (peaks and trends), whether email campaigns correlate with momentous events and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what hidden content revealed. This is studied through an in-depth analysis of the body of 50 0.0 0 0 phishing emails addressed to Dutch registered top-level domains collected during the start of the pandemic. The study reveals that most COVID-19 related phishing emails follow known patterns indicating that perpetrators are more likely to adapt than to reinvent their schemes.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Cybersecurity incidents have been growing in number with high severity. To response to the Cybersecurity incidents, the attacked organizations generally execute predetermined procedures and then apply digital forensics to recover and investigate material on digital media and networks. The digital forensics procedure composes of four important processes including identification, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence which is legally admitted in any legal proceedings. This paper is aimed to study effecting factors on selecting methods of digital forensics according to standards and international practices from reliable international organizations. The paper demonstrated internal and external organization factors that used for determining the digital forensic methods to conform to enforced laws or principal rules in the organizations. Additionally, it revealed viewpoints from information security professionals to determine standards and international practices for digital forensics to apply in an organization. The study pointed out that factors relating to law and regulations was the most significant factor that most of organizations (67%) used to determine international approach or standards for digital forensic. This made the standards of NIST more reliable, and it has been adopted by most organizations for digital forensic. This research can be further applied to develop the methods for digital forensics in near future.
A growing number of studies show that the advent of the Internet has transformed the organisational life of crime, with many academic and non-academic articles and reports describing various types of organisational structures involved in cybercrimes as organised crime. Other researchers are more critical in applying the organised crime label to cybercrimes. These debates are not merely speculative and scholastic but have a real practical significance, as over-estimating organised crime involvement can attract more resources (which might end up being allocated in a less efficient way), additional legal powers, and support from the general public. This study aims to further this path of inquiry by investigating whether the advancement of the cyber-organised crime narrative in the UK can be identified also in the media discourse. More specifically, this study will analyse UK press to explore to what extent moral panic can be identified, how primary definers use particular tactics and rhetorical constructions, and what are the dominant consequences.
Digital technology for transferring and controlling data has made substantial advances in recent years. It is important to protect innovations and to curb the copyright infringements in computer-based systems. Copyright is a legal framework of basic rights, allowing the owner to control or permit someone else to reproduce copyrighted works with commercial value. in recent decades, copyright violations have been moving into the criminal realm. This paper focuses on the procedure guidance of a fictitious P2P model, and discusses whether it contributes to the crime of copyright infringement in dealing with the distribution of digital content. From the perspective of internet forensics, the action research and the whole control mechanism, it is shown that a commercial server has full control over the P2P model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Social networking sites (SNSs) can provide cybercriminals with various opportunities, including gathering of user data and login credentials to enable fraud, and directing of users toward online locations that may install malware onto their devices. The techniques employed by such cybercriminals can include clickbait (text or video), advertisement of nonexistent but potentially desirable products, and hoax competitions/giveaways. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with falling victim to these malicious techniques. An online survey was completed by 295 Malaysian undergraduate students, finding that more than one-third had fallen victim to SNS scams. Logistic regression analysis identified several victimization risk factors including having higher scores in impulsivity (specifically cognitive complexity), using fewer devices for SNSs, and having been on an SNS for a longer duration. No reliable model was found for vulnerability to hoax valuable gift giveaways and friend view application advertising specifically, but vulnerability to video clickbait was predicted by lower extraversion scores, higher levels of openness to experience, using fewer devices, and being on an SNS for a longer duration. Other personality traits were not associated with either overall victimization susceptibility or increased risk of falling victim to the specific techniques. However, age approached significance within both the video clickbait and overall victimization models. These findings suggest that routine activity theory may be particularly beneficial in understanding and preventing SNSs scam victimization.
Advance fee fraud is a significant component of online criminal activity. Fraudsters can often make off with significant sums, and victims will usually find themselves plagued by follow-up scams. Previous studies of how fraudsters persuade their victims have been limited to the initial solicitation emails sent to a broad population of email users. In this paper, we use the lens of scam-baiting - a vigilante activity whereby members of the public intentionally waste the time of fraudsters - to move beyond this first contact and examine the persuasive tactics employed by a fraudster once their victim has responded to a scam. We find linguistic patterns in scammer and baiter communications that suggest that the mode of persuasion used by scammers shifts over a conversation, and describe a corresponding stage model of scammer persuasion strategy. We design and evaluate a number of classifiers for identifying scam-baiting conversations amidst regular email, and for separating scammer from baiter messages based on their textual content, achieving high classification accuracy for both tasks. This forms a crucial basis for automated intervention, with a tool for identifying victims and a model for understanding how they are currently being exploited.
Phishing is a form of cybercrime where an attacker imitates a real person / institution by promoting them as an official person or entity through e-mail or other communication mediums. In this type of cyber attack, the attacker sends malicious links or attachments through phishing e-mails that can perform various functions, including capturing the login credentials or account information of the victim. These e-mails harm victims because of money loss and identity theft. In this study, a software called Anti Phishing Simulator was developed, giving information about the detection problem of phishing and how to detect phishing emails. With this software, phishing and spam mails are detected by examining mail contents. Classification of spam words added to the database by Bayesian algorithm is provided.
Computing technology is becoming more prolific in of user adoption and advancement of technology. We are finding new ways of automation and capturing information. Information as they say is power and power is money. Hence, powerful rich targets are bound to be attractive to many hackers. The rise in cybercrime and the ransom attack of the Southern US gas pipeline highlight the need for securing our computer and network systems. One security method employed by Information Systems Security professionals is hacking networks with penetration testing tools. This paper reviews and analyzes 18 different tools covering 6 different areas. The analysis ends with a discussion of how businesses and security professionals can use these tools to help prevent attacks, maintain the integrity of the organization's cyber space, and keep costs down.
Technical Support Scam (TSS) is a cybercrime that not only elicits the trust of a user but swindles their property. To detect TSS attacks in malicious samples, an intelligent TSS-aware system, called the AI@TSS system, was proposed in the study. The proposed AI@TSS system was built by the LightGBM algorithm with different kinds of features. In the study, 8263 malicious web page samples and 8263 TSS web page samples were collected and 42 features are defined for modeling the AI@TSS system. The performance analysis results demonstrate that the AI@TSS system reaches the accuracy and precision of 98% and 100%, respectively. The comparison shows superior to the existing detection methods, with 2.16% and 3.48% improvement in accuracy and precision.
The impact of cyber-crime has necessitated intelligence and law enforcement agencies across the world to tackle cyber threats. All sectors are now facing similar dilemmas of how to best mitigate against cyber-crime and how to promote security effectively to people and organizations. Extracting unique and high value intelligence by harvesting public records to create a comprehensive profile of certain targets is emerging rapidly as an important means for the intelligence community. As the amount of available open sources rapidly increases, countering cyber-crime increasingly depends upon advanced software tools and techniques to collect and process the information in an effective and efficient manner. This chapter reviews current efforts of employing open source data for cyber-criminal investigations developing an integrative OSINT Cybercrime Investigation Framework.
Hari Kunzru's 2004 novel Transmission offers an important imaging of the hacker as a troubling figure within the global polity: its principal character is a migrant hacker who tests and resists the protocols of national and multilateral organizations which seek to regulate cybercrime, but here technology is seen to effect a reassertion of space and identity as much as it allows new forms of transnational movement. Drawing in particular on Castells' The Internet Galaxy, Parikka's Digital Contagions, and Wark's A Hacker Manifesto (as well as work on the wider social, historical, and legal context of cybercriminality), this article considers the ways in which hacking acts against neoliberal narratives of global inclusion and points instead to an alternative politics of social intervention.
The expansion of the information society has brought with it a revolution in the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT). In South Africa, the adoption of various digital devices and technologies has introduced conveniences but at the same time it also opens up the door for various cybercrime attackers. This digital paradox demonstrates that ICT has tremendous capabilities for the rapid provision of services but at the same time can be exploited by malicious cybercriminals. It is vital that organisations and individuals not overlook the strong imperative for cybersecurity. In an interconnected world, cybersecurity and cybercrime go hand in hand. With cyber-attacks and data breaches are on the rise organisations need to be constantly adapting their security measures and preparing for cyber threats. At the end of 2017, a survey was carried out on the state of cyber readiness levels across various sectors in South Africa. The aim of the survey was to identify the current security posture in organisations and ascertain where the gaps were in order to respond to developing cyber threats. Cybersecurity needs to be viewed from various dimensions and thus the survey focused on the status of cybersecurity plans, strategies, governance, standards, Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) membership, awareness programs, vulnerability and risk assessments as well as incident management capabilities. This paper presents the results of the survey which are further analysed in order to contextualise critical findings and recommendations. The survey provided important insights into cyber readiness in South Africa. In this paper the results are placed in context of global trends in order to determine key areas that require attention. It is important to identify how organisations in South Africa should be dealing with disaster recovery planning and how to remain operational when faced with system interruptions and interferences. Contextualising the cyber readiness levels helps asses the latest threat landscape, as well as develop strategies to mitigate these cyber risks.
"The problems of safeguarding cybersecurity have gotten much worse in recent years. The risks in cybersecurity are increasing rapidly in our country. Because the cybersecurity defenses and computer crime investigation systems of our government and businesses have been threatened, the damage of cybercrime for national security and public security will become more critical, even more than violent crime and economic crime. The national cyber forensics mechanism and laboratory will play a crucial role in dealing with cybercrime. In 2003, our government conducted a research of digital evidence, the standard procedure of the operations and cyber forensic laboratory. It included the organization, training, technical capability, legislation, and operation procedures. In 2004, our government made a policy to build the first nationwide cyber security and forensic laboratory. It will be one of the major cybersecurity defense mechanisms in Taiwan. Our bureau (MJIB) made a plan and got the additional budget to build a cyber forensic lab this year [1]. This study has four aspects: 1) The study of reliable cyber forensic software and hardware; 2) The standard of the operating procedures of cyber forensics; 3) Training courses for the examiner, including an internationally well-known certification system in cyber forensics; and 4) The study of certification for the cyber forensic laboratory. Cyber forensics is still in its early stages in Taiwan. More professional cyber forensic manpower is needed, as well as a certified cyber forensic mechanism. It is expected that cyber forensics will become increasingly important for cybersecurity policy [1] and management in the future. Hence, building a certificated laboratory and establishing the SOP of cyber forensics from this study can be the basis to cultivate cyber forensic capabilities in our country. In this way, law enforcement will get more help from our laboratory. The laboratory, through its operation, also enhances the ability of Taiwan's cyber forensic professionals and provides more convincing digital evidence in court. Furthermore, it can consolidate cybersecurity systems and the e-Taiwan environment."
Fake news has been the focus of debate, especially since the election of Donald Trump (2016), and remains a topic of concern in democratic countries worldwide, given (a) their threat to democratic systems and (b) the difficulty in detecting them. Despite the deployment of sophisticated computational systems to identify fake news, as well as the streamlining of fact-checking methods, appropriate fake news detection mechanisms have not yet been found. In fact, technological approaches are likely to be inefficient, given that fake news are based mostly on partisanship and identity politics, and not necessarily on outright deception. However, as disinformation is inherently expressed linguistically, this is a privileged room for forensic linguistic analysis. This article builds upon a forensic linguistic analysis of fake news pieces published in English and in Portuguese, which were collected since 2019 from acknowledged fake news outlets. The preliminary empirical analysis reveals that fake news pieces employ particular linguistic features, e.g. at the levels of typography, orthography and spelling, and morphosyntax. The systematic identification of these features, which will allow mapping linguistic resources and patterns used in those contexts, contributes to scholarship, not only by enabling a streamlined development of computational detection systems, but more importantly by permitting the forensic linguistics expert to assist criminal investigations and give evidence in court.
External biometrics such as thumbprint and facial recognition have become standard tools for securing our digital devices and protecting our data. These systems, however, are potentially prone to copying and cybercrime access. Researchers have therefore explored internal biometrics, such as the electrical patterns within an electrocardiogram (ECG). The heart's electrical signals carry sufficient distinctiveness to allow the ECG to be used as an internal biometric for user authentication and identification. Using the ECG in this way has many potential advantages and limitations. This article reviews the history of ECG biometrics and explores some of the technical and security considerations. It also explores current and future uses of the ECG as an internal biometric.
Identity theft continues to grow in prevalence and complexity. Despite this growth, little is known about the identity theft response system and how it assists victims to recover. This study examines the response system by analysing 211 identity theft cases reported to IDCARE, a national identity and cybercrime victim support service. The study applies a sociotechnical systems methodology to establish the social, task and information processes of the Australian identity theft response system. The study also examines identity theft victims' response activities and needs over a 12 -month period. The identity theft response system is almost entirely dependent on the victim to respond to and limit the harm caused by identity theft. Overall, the response system is disjointed and lacking in coordination.
Online hacking forums have been used as communities where users, possibly cybercriminals, can learn and exchange knowledge, and purchase the necessary tools and information to commit various offences such as hacking, credit card/identity fraud, money laundering, and even cyberattacks on infrastructure. Monitoring these forums and identifying key players are important when investigating emergent threats and developing efficient disruption strategies. Literature shows the lack of studies regarding users' cross-forum activity. This paper presents an analysis of forum users' cross-posting in three hacking forums including user overlap among different hacking communities/forums and identify user roles based on the type of posts and their frequencies. This allows us to assess the impact of users and forums in terms of cybercrime victimization.
The number of cybercrime involving digital evidence will continue to increase as Internet become more intertwined in society. As criminals deny committing crime, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are hindered by the limited processing capabilities of human analysis. This paper presents a practical digital forensics framework of exploring ISO/IEC 27043: 2015 activities to lessen the caseload burden. It provides a suggestion for applying the Helix3 function to meet the need of incident investigation processes at scene or lab. While live investigative response at scene puts emphasis on finding actionable intelligence immediately, dead forensic analysis at lab pays great attention to reconstructing the case and conducting cross examination to find the truth. Both are critical in the investigation response of cyber security incident.
The significance of cybercrime as a threat has significantly increased in the last decade, making cybersecurity a crucial issue for organizations, government agencies, and the general use of information technologies. According to the Australian Cybersecurity Center (ACSC), organizations worldwide face significant risks to their internal infrastructure, and therefore require cybersecurity professionals. This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the reverse engineering process and offer practical solutions for reverse engineering methods. Through the examination of a product's source code, software reverse engineering can reconstruct its original intent, features, and specifications. A database of programs is then created, and data is obtained from it. Reverse engineering is conducted on different systems to facilitate their maintenance by increasing transparency and producing relevant documentation.
"Saudi Arabia has seen an enormous growth in Internet usage over the past few years. With increasing adoption of this technology has come a rise in cybercrime, often enabled through use of social engineering. Phishing is a prime example, aiming to deceive users into resealing personal data. The paper describes efforts to understand individuals' responses to phishing attacks through application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). It reports a survey that considers three common social engineering persuading strategies, Authority, Social Proof and Scarcity. Results show correlations between these strategies and TPB. In particular, between attitude and intention to respond under the Authority strategy; subjective norms and intention to respond under the Social Proof strategy; and subjective norms and intention to respond under the Scarcity strategy."
"Phishing is a type of cybercrime committed by attackers to steal sensitive information. This paper focuses on URL-based phishing detection, i.e., detecting phishing webpages by analyzing the URL. Previously proposed methods tackled this problem; however, insufficient word tokenization of URLs arises unknown words, which degrades the detection accuracy. To solve the unknownword problem, we propose a new tokenization algorithm, called URL-Tokenizer, which integrates BERT and WordSegment tokenizers, besides utilizing 24 NLP features. Then, we adopt the URL-Tokenizer to the DNN-CNN hybrid model to leverage the detection accuracy. Our experiment using the Ebbu2017 dataset confirmed that our word-DNN-CNN achieves an AUC of 99.89% compared to the state-of-the-art DNN-BiLSTM with an AUC of 98.78%."
This paper investigates the evolution of investment scam lures and scam-related keywords in the cryptocurrency online forum Bitcointalk over a period of 12 years. Our findings show a shift in scam-related keywords found within posts in the forum, where Ponzi was the most popular and most frequently mentioned in 2014 and 2018 and HYIP appeared more often in 2018 and 2021. We also identify that the financial principle is the tactic more likely to be used to lure people into investment scams from 2015 until 2017, coinciding with the period when Ponzi was the most commonly found keyword. This is followed by a transition to the authority and distraction principles from 2018 until 2022, which also coincides with the increase of popularity of HYIP. We collect more than 17.8M posts from 399k threads from the forum, from July 2010 until June 2022. Our longitudinal analysis shows the popularity transition between subforums and keywords across time. We design a categorisation criteria and annotate 4,218 posts from 2,630 threads based on it. We then use the annotated sample to train four machine learning statistical models. We use the best performing model to classify all 281k English-language threads into four categories: overt scams, potential scams, scam comments and not investment scam related. We analyze the frequency changes of scam-related threads across the 12 year period and observe that overt and potential scams peaked in 2015 and 2018 respectively. We see that potential scams also increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use heuristics to pinpoint the types of cryptocurrencies most frequently used within scam advertisements. Bitcoin is most commonly found in potential scams while Ethereum appears more often than other cryptocurrencies in overt scams. We use machine learning classifiers to identify the scam actor types behind the posts categorised as overt and potential scams. We also classify the type of lure used by scammers. Our results indicate that the time principle is not a tactic used as frequently as expected. Finally, we observe the influence of the pandemic in the strategies used to lure victims, reflected in higher than expected use of the kindness principle in 2021 and 2022.
Combatting criminal misuse of cryptocurrencies was at the core of the FATF agenda under the US Presidency, culminating in June 2019 with the thorough extension of international standards against money laundering over virtual assets' markets. This echoed the first legislative measure regulating virtual currencies adopted by the EU a year before. Directive 2018/843, better known as the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, fails however to address key technological breakthroughs and new business models, which continuously make the ever-growing and fast-paced crypto economy evolve. Against this background, the present contribution investigates shortfalls and challenges that lay ahead in the light of the new FATF Recommendations. It ultimately argues that the preventive anti-money laundering measures cannot dispense with the establishment of a cross-border integrated supervisory and enforcement system.
The rapid development in 5G cellular and IoT technologies is expected to be deployed widespread in the next few years. At the same time, crime rates are also increasing to a greater extent while the investigation officers are held responsible to deal with a broad range of cyber and internet issues in investigations. Therefore, advanced IT technologies and IoT devices can be deployed to ease the investigation process, especially, the identification of suspects. At present, only a few research works has been conducted upon deep learning-based Face Sketch Synthesis (FSS) models, concerning its success in diverse application domains including conventional face recognition. This paper proposes a new IoT-enabled Optimal Deep Learning based Convolutional Neural Network (ODL-CNN) for FSS to assist in suspect identification process. The hyper parameter optimization of the DL-CNN model was performed using Improved Elephant Herd Optimization (IEHO) algorithm. In the beginning, the proposed method captures the surveillance videos using IoT-based cameras which are then fed into the proposed ODL-CNN model. The proposed method initially involves preprocessing in which the contrast enhancement process is carried out using Gamma correction method. Then, the ODL-CNN model draws the sketches of the input images following which it undergoes similarity assessment, with professional sketch being drawn as per the directions from eyewitnesses. When the similarity between both the sketches are high, the suspect gets identified. A comprehensive qualitative and quantitative examination was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the presented ODL-CNN model. A detailed simulation analysis pointed out the effective performance of ODL-CNN model with maximum average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 20.11dB, Average Structural Similarity (SSIM) of 0.64 and average accuracy of 90.10%.
In today's digital world, cybercrime has become biggest challenge to face in order to keep the confidential information secure from intruders. The security mechanisms used to curb the cyberattacks, need to be improvised on constant basis with the help of advanced mathematical techniques. This paper deals with new cryptography based iterative method by using successive Elzaki transform of linear combination of functions for encryption and corresponding inverse Elzaki transform for decryption. Starting with a detailed procedure, we presented our work in the form of result. Further, it is generalized and then we applied the iterative method for making our algorithm more secure. We also implemented this method programmatically using PYTHON language which fits current needs. Finally, we illustrate our results with suitable examples.
New technologies from day to day are submitted with many vulnerabilities that can make data exploitation. Nowadays, IoT is a target for Cybercrime attacks as it is one of the popular platforms in the century. This research address the IoT security problem by carried a medium-interaction honeypot. Honeypot is one of the solutions that can be done because it is a system feed for the introduction of attacks and fraudulent devices. This research has created a medium interaction honeypot using Cowrie, which is used to maintain the Internet of Things device from malware attacks or even attack patterns and collect information about the attacker's machine. From the result analysis, the honeypot can record all trials and attack activities, with CPU loads averagely below 6,3%.
Identity-based crimes are considered to be one of the most significant and growing problems of the last 20 years due to the significant economic harm these offenses pose for victims. The increased use and availability of personal information through on-line outlets has significantly increased the risk of identity-based fraud, although few have considered the factors that affect the likelihood of this type of victimization. This study utilizes a sample of students, faculty, and staff at a southeastern university to investigate the effects that protective factors possess on fostering resiliency against on-line identity theft. The findings suggest that protective software programs increase individual resiliency to victimization. The implications of this study for both resiliency models and cybercrime victimization are considered in detail.
Despite growing interest in cybercrime, the Internet still poses significant challenges for criminological understanding. Its penetration of everyday life is relevant to many crime types, not just cybercrimes. This article examines the ways in which criminal commitments form using the Internet and related communication technologies that empower the individual relative to the group (gang, mafia, etc.). We argue this occurs in two ways. First, it allows individuals to limit involvement in particular associations or networks. The concept of digital drift is used to explore this element. Second, it allows them to commit crimes more autonomously through facilitating self-instruction. Drawing on Goffman, the importance of studying the encounter as the basic unit of a criminal interaction order is proposed.
Is crime reduced by highly publicized punishment events? Is crime reduced by law enforcement's public relations work? These longstanding questions are addressed in a novel context-digital drug markets. An analysis of trade data from two large and illegal e-commerce websites, collected on a daily basis for ten months, examined how market revenue was affected by (1) media coverage of police work on such markets and (2) the highly publicized conviction and life-sentencing of a market founder. Trade increased after periods with elevated media coverage, and also after the two court events. Possible explanations for the increase in trade after the trial outcomes are discussed in an analysis of textual conversations in three online forums associated with illegal e-commerce.
Competent security administrators are needed for effective detection of incessant criminal intrusion attempts we witness nowadays. The required competence includes the ability to analyze a suspicious attempt with a high degree of awareness of the situation surrounding the attempt. However, the extant literature on information security awareness focuses on end-user education and overlooks the type that is critical for security administrators to perform their tasks. This paper presents a model about factors influencing detection of criminal intrusions, based on the military concept of situation awareness (SA). We argue that in using intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to deflect criminal intrusions, SA is critical because of the highly dynamic nature of the task at hand and the information processing capability it requires. We support our argument by explicating the roles of two foundational antecedents to SA - experience (as evidenced in the administrator's usage pattern of memory) and interface design (graphical versus command-line).
"Some Nigerian universities are digitising their scholarly heritage , the high risk of loss or attack of digital records due to viruses and cyber hacks is worrisome, with far reaching consequences on the confidentiality, integrity and availability triad. This paper examines cybersecurity and institutional repository (IR) protection in Nigeria, highlighting the impact of cybersecurity and risk management. The study explores the five core frameworks of cybersecurity with emphasis on strategies for policy development and management of risk. It also analyses security threats through feedback from professionals in the referenced domain. A manual assessment was conducted with all Nigeria institutional repositories registered on opendoar.org using qualitative descriptive analysis. The sample size of the study consists of 88 librarians , information, communication and technology workers. A structured questionnaire on threats and risks of institutional repositories in Nigeria were distributed and 62(70.4%) responded. Results show that, of 198 federal, state and private universities, only 29 (14.6%) have established institutional repositories with slow adoption rate of 12.5% from 2009 to 2020 , 2019 having the highest established IR at a growth rate of 24%. Total number of items uploaded was 22,828. This paper found that DSpace open repository software had 79.3% use among institutions, while 26 institutions (89.6%) have uploaded journal articles. Hardware and software threats stood out prominently as leading causes of sub-optimal repository performance. Evaluated against an assigned weighted point system (of 31) derived from number of technical workers in IR domain, data reveals malware and malicious code as the biggest risk to repository resources, with 30.6%, followed by password attacks at 28% and IP theft 27.8% points respectively. However, hardening security systems guarding institutional hardware, software and infrastructure such as; management of identity access and operation, secure network application and data, could reduce incidents of cyber-crime. The research study recommends the development of modern cybersecurity framework for university libraries, mechanism for data defenses and redundancy strategies such as decentralisation of data and networks to mitigate the risk of vulnerability to attack and reduce loss from cyber incidents."
This is the first article to analyze children's involvement in technology-facilitated coercive control in Australia. The primary research question was ''How do mothers describe their children's involvement in technology-facilitated coercive control?. This article is based on incidental findings from a larger study on Australian women's experiences of technology-facilitated abuse in the context of domestic violence. Although children were not the focus of the study, semi-structured interviews with twelve mothers yielded discussion of children's involvement in the abuse. We used thematic analysis to identify key dynamics and contexts of this abuse. We found that mothers and their children are co-victims of coercive control. Mothers interviewed for the study reported that children were involved in technology-facilitated coercive control directly and indirectly. This study bridges the gap between the extant research on children and coercive control and technology-facilitated abuse by highlighting the ways children are involved in technology-facilitated coercive control. The social and legal contexts of co-parenting with abusive fathers exposed mothers and children to ongoing post-separation abuse, extending abusive fathers' absent presence in the lives of children
With the rapid development of information technology, cybercrimes are getting increasingly rampant. The popularity of various toolkits facilitates the cyber-attackers to intrude on online systems and access the vast streams of sensitive data. Prevention is better than cure. Penetration testing (PT) not only defends the illegal attacks but also identify potential vulnerabilities. It is capable of distinguishing network traffic on the massive amount of collected data from the following three phases: data reduction, data analysis, and data classification. This paper analyzes the PT network traffic and observes their tool marks.
This article discusses the data embassy, a new international legal concept created in response to a pressing problem. In 2007, Estonia fell victim to 'distributed denial-of-service attacks' and consequently, made Estonia's entire public sector data communications network inoperable. Their response was to strengthen their protection against and penalization for cybercrime, and to develop the concept of a 'data embassy'. On 20 June 2017 the Republic of Estonia and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed an 'Agreement on the hosting of data and information systems', to host Estonian data in Luxembourg. Such data embassies perform a unique function and benefit from many privileges and immunities, but their legal status has been unclear. This article addresses the question concerning the legal status of the premises of the data embassy.
Today's Internet technology becomes more advanced. Computer has been increasingly applied in all aspects of the society, and we will continue to increase and expand. In the continuous development of computer applications, a lot of problems are emerging, in which using computer as a means of theft or damaging others are common. It not only brings a lot of security risks for people's lives but also brings more and more social harm. In mass of information in the network, if you want to investigate who using what kind of means to do cybercrime precisely and effectively, the traditional forensic techniques cannot meet our needs. Therefore, in computer crime investigation, how to identify computer crime and how to get the evidence is still a problem worthy studying.
The development of the Internet and e-commerce tools have simplified the process of commercial exchange for both legal and illicit goods. The rise of online markets for illicit goods enable access to facilitatory resources for crime, such as firearms and counterfeit identity documents. Few have considered how these online markets facilitate the sale of counterfeit currencies for use in offline environments. The current study attempted to address this gap in the literature through a qualitative crime script analysis of counterfeit currency vendors operating on both the Open and Dark Web to understand the ways vendors advertise, actualize, and exit these transactions. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of the acquisition processes of facilitatory products are explored in detail.
Criminal offending and victimization often overlap in both the virtual and offline worlds. However, scholars are still unsure how the offending-victimization relationship plays out between the online and offline worlds. Using a sample of 2,491 adults, four clusters are discovered: 1) those unlikely to have offended or been victimized, 2) those who had online victimization and offending experiences, 3) Those who have been victimized offline and online, but who are unlikely to have offended, and 4) individuals who were victims both online and offline and offended online. Thus, the offending-victimization overlap may be common, but it is certainly not exclusive.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency whose transactions are recorded on a distributed, openly accessible ledger. On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity's real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with approximate to 385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of approximate to 79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem. We discuss the potential applications of our method for organizational regulation and compliance, societal implications, outline study limitations, and propose future research directions. A prototype implementation of our method for organizational use is included in the appendix.
Cyber-attacks are likely to continue to increase in size and frequency. As attackers get smarter than before, so do efforts made to protect against unwanted data theft. The purpose of this paper is to look for unusual patterns by repeatable experiments among the constant buzz of network packets that make up PT activities. The utilization of different PT toolkits, like Winfingerprint, Superscan, Nmap, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, NeoTrace, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, and Path Analyzer Pro, facilitates cyber-attackers to bring down online system. It is capable of discerning network traffic on the vast streams of network information available through the connected machines from the following three phases: data collection, data reduction, and data analysis. Network forensics can aid in detecting attack behavior. This paper accommodates real-time evidence collection as a network feature against attackers. The identification of unusual patterns in network packets has been put to use in the ongoing battle to stay one step ahead of malicious hackers, who could be anyone from disgruntled customers to nation states. This approach can be easily deployed and should be applicable to any type of network-based assessment.
Transnationality, enabled by global processes and the rapid development of the Internet, has led to the creation of new dynamics of criminal activities, where cyberspace becomes a place, goal and mean of committing criminal activities. The aim of this paper is to present criminal activities related to crypto-assets in a coherent and concise way. The misuse of crypto-assets will be investigated in a systematic way, especially from the present the characteristics of cryptocurrencies that make them suitable for criminal contribute to the theoretical perspective of crypto-assets abuse and the taxonomy of criminal acts related to crypto-assets.
Blockchain-based systems become increasingly attractive targets for cybercrime due to the rising amount of value transacted in respective systems. However, a comprehensive overview of existing attack vectors and a directive discussion of resulting research opportunities are missing. Employing a structured literature review, we extract and analyze 87 relevant attacks on blockchain-based systems and assign them to common attack vectors. We subsequently derive a research framework and agenda for information systems research on the cybersecurity of blockchain-based systems. We structure our framework along the users, developers, and attackers of both blockchain applications and blockchain infrastructure, highlighting the reciprocal relationships between these entities. Our results show that especially socio-technical aspects of blockchain cybersecurity are underrepresented in research and require further attention.
Ransomware is one of the malicious software that is designed to prevent access to computer system until a sum of money is paid by the victim to the attacker. During the infection, the computer will either be locked, or the data will be encrypted. Ransoms are often demanded in Bitcoin, a largely anonymous Cryptocurrency. All transactions are recorded in the blockchain and verified by peer-to-peer networks. This paper investigation collects ten recent ransomware families, which use bitcoin as a payment for their ransom. In conjunction, we identified, collected and analysed Bitcoin addresses of users combining information from a clustering model and the blockchain. We used a heuristic clustering algorithm to reveal the hidden node's payment of ransomware. Finally, we demonstrated the characteristics of ransomware encryption mechanisms that include a view of the infected process and its execution, and the distinctive demands of ransom.
"This article examines the network structure, criminal cooperation, and external interactions of cybercriminal networks. Its contribution is empirical and inductive. The core of this study involved carrying out 10 case analyses on closed cybercrime investigations - all with financial motivations on the part of the offenders - in the UK and beyond. Each analysis involved investigator interview and access to unpublished law enforcement files. The comparison of these cases resulted in a wide range of findings on these cybercriminal networks, including: a common division between the scam/attack components and the money components; the presence of offline/local elements; a broad, and sometimes blurred, spectrum of cybercriminal behaviour and organisation. An overarching theme across the cases that we observe is that cybercriminal business models are relatively stable."
Cybersecurity is becoming more relevant throughout time. As information and technologies expand, so does the potential for it to be exploited. Computer and media have become more widespread in every modern country in the world. Unfortunately, certain community uses this opportunity to exploit the vulnerabilities that these computers left behind. Black hat, which is more identified as hackers and exploiters, uses the networks and servers that are commonly used to gain unauthorized information and data on the innocent victim. This work analyzes several honeypots and makes comparisons between them. Analysis has been done on the results to figure the disadvantages between each honeypot and try to improve one of the honeypots based on programming. The honeypot is deployed to simulate its effectiveness in combating cybercrime by detecting and collecting the information captured on the web browsers.
Internet of vehicles (IoV) is the evolution of conventional vehicle network (VANET), a recent domain attracting a large number of companies and researchers. It is an integration of three networks: an inter-vehicle network, an intra-vehicle network, and vehicular mobile Internet, in which the vehicle is considered as a smart object equipped with powerful multi-sensors platform, connectivity and communication technologies, enabling it to communicate with the world. The cooperative communication between vehicles and other devices causes diverse challenges in terms of: storage and computing capability, energy of vehicle and network's control and management. Security is very important aspect in IoV and it is required to protect connected cars from cybercrime and accidents. In this article, we propose a network model for IoV based on software Defined Network and Cloud Computing.
The technological adoption and widespread use of generative AI, as represented by ChatGPT, have altered the conventional mode of interaction between humans and AI and profoundly changed the way our society operates. In response to the multifarious risks associated with generative AI, spanning ethical considerations, intellectual property protection, privacy and data protection, market monopoly, cybercrime, and data security concerns, discussions on the status of AI subjects and legal regulation have surfaced both on a global and domestic scale. It is argued in the present study that generative AI governance should uphold the principle of reconciling safety and development, craft an AI code of ethics in line with the umbrella of the human-centered principle, and promote a comprehensive legal framework of AI based on general AI legislation, supplemented by specialized management approaches for generative AI, and underpinned by established legal norms.
Phishing is a cybercrime that is increasing exponentially day by day. In phishing, a phisher employs social engineering and technology to misdirect victims towards revealing their personal information, which can then be exploited. Despite ongoing research to find effective anti-phishing solutions, phishing remains a serious security problem for Internet users. In this paper, an investigation of using CAPTCHA keystroke dynamics to enhance the prevention of phishing attacks was presented. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted, with the results indicating the proposed approach as highly effective in protecting online services from phishing attacks. The results showed a 0% false-positive rate and 17.8% false-negative rate. Overall, the proposed solution provided a practical and effective way of preventing phishing attacks.
Billions of people have access to the online environment through which runs financial transfers or personal data. The boundaries of cybercrime are particularly diffuse. The critical areas are in the focus of the offenders. The balance of profits and losses can be seriously prejudiced if the directions of international bodies are ignored. Defensive systems can become casualties due to poor management or lack of investment. The phenomenon can be overcome only by a mature approach, one that is professional and that takes full responsibility. The article attempts to underline the role of the IT infrastructure in the light of technological evolution and some of the effects that can arise. The proposed defence strategies have as objective fulfilling the readers expectations.
Phishing is a form of cybercrime used to lure a victim to reveal his/her sensitive personal information to fraudulent web pages. To protect users from phishing attacks, many anti-phishing techniques have been proposed to block suspicious web pages, which are identified against registered black-lists, or checked by search engines. However, such approaches usually have difficulty in keeping up with the rapidly emerging phishing web pages. To lessen this problem, this paper proposes a technique for identifying suspicious web pages, based on the literal and conceptual consistency between the URL and web contents. By using the search logs only as reference data, our approach can achieve 98% accuracy, showing that it is effective in detecting various forms of phishing attack.
Network forensics is addressed to deal with cybercrime. The main purpose of a network forensics system is reconstructing evidences of network attacks. In order to reconstruct evidence, the network attack is firstly identified. Therefore, network attack detection solutions play an important role in network forensics. There are two main types of network attacks: network level and application level. Network level attack detection solutions focus on the information in the headers of network packets. While, application level attack detection solutions investigate the data fragments carried out in the packet payloads. We propose an approach based on Shannon entropy and machine learning techniques to identify executable content for anomaly-based network attack detection in network forensics systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides very high detection rate.
This study investigated perceptions of child sexual abuse in a hypothetical cybersexploitation case. Men were predicted to be more negative toward the victim than were women. Victims were predicted to be more negatively judged when they consented to sex than when they did not and when they were lied to than when they were not. Two hundred and seventy-six respondents read a sexual abuse depiction in which the perpetrator's disclosure about his age (being honest from the outset, lying, or refusing to disclose when questioned) and the final outcome of the meeting (consensual verses nonconsensual sexual intercourse) were varied between subjects. Respondents then completed a 17-item attribution scale. ANOVAs revealed broad support for the predictions. Results have implications for education about cybercrime.
Cyber world is undergoing constant and boundless development when cybercrime has always hindered its progress. The advantages of digitalization has inevitably enabled crime to expand its unhindered impact by physical limitations. As the Internet becomes accessible, cyberbullying inflicts social and mental wounds upon the victims. As the presence of cyberbullying becomes more prominent, awareness must be raised among Internet users of its insidious nature. If an individual is exposed to a criminally infested environment in his everyday lifestyle, there is a high possibility for him/her to conform to criminal behaviors and activities. Implications for Routine Activity Theory (RAT) are discussed in Taiwan cyberbullying incident. It is believed that the proposed capable guardianship strategy can protect Internet users from being victimized by cyberbullying, facilitate to cut down its circuit, and fight against it.
Owing to the increasing number and complexity of malware threats, research on automated malware detection has become a hot topic in the field of network security. Traditional malware detection techniques require a lot of human intervention and resources (in terms of time and storage) as these involve manual analysis of all malware files in the application. Moreover, malware authors have developed techniques like polymorphism and code obfuscation that evade the traditional signature-based detection approaches employed by anti-virus companies. To solve this issue, malware detection enabled by deep learning (DL) methods is being used recently. This paper presents a performance comparison of 26 state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models in Android malware detection. It also includes performance obtained by large-scale learning with SVM and RF classifiers and stacking with CNN models. Based on the results, an EfficientNet-B4 CNN-based model is proposed to detect Android malware using image-based malware representations of the Android DEX file. EfficientNet-B4 extracts relevant features from the malware images. These features are then passed through a global average pooling layer and fed into a softmax classifier. The proposed method obtained an accuracy of 95.7% in the binary classification of Android malware images, outperforming the compared models in all performance metrics. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to the offline world, the online environment is more anonymous and therefore less easily controlled. Criminological theories generally show that people are more likely to commit crime when they experience or perceive less formal or informal social control. Consequently, one might assume that people are more likely to commit crime online than offline. As formal social control is lacking, informal social control and peer-offending may be important predictors of online offending. In this paper, we examine to what extent differences in perceived formal and informal online control are related to the likelihood that a person will commit a system-trespassing offense (i.e. malicious hacking). Additionally, we examine peer system-trespassing, and how this may interact with perceptions of formal and informal social control. In the logistic regression analyses we employ eight different measures for perceptions of formal and informal social control, in addition to peer-offending, and control variables. Both direct effects and interaction effects are examined. Our results show that peer-offending is an important predictor of system-trespassing and interaction effects show that perceived formal and informal online social control are related to this type of offending but only for specific groups. Implications will be discussed.
Individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI) may be vulnerable to cyberscams due to their cognitive and psychosocial impairments. However, the lived experiences of cyberscam survivors with ABI and their close others is not understood, and no effective intervention has been identified. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perspectives of cyberscam survivors with ABI (n = 7) and their close others (n = 6). Semi-structured interviews explored the scam experience, impacts, vulnerabilities and interventions. Reflexive thematic analysis of interview transcripts identified seven themes: who is at the helm?: vulnerabilities, the lure: scammer tactics, scammers aboard: scam experience, the discovery, sinking in: impacts, responding to the mayday: responses from others, and lifesavers: suggestions for intervention. The journey towards scam victimisation was complex, and complicated by the ABI. Cyberscams contributed to substantial financial disadvantage, loss of trust and shame. ABI related impairments and social isolation reportedly increased scam vulnerability and interfered with intervention attempts by family and professionals. Confusion, denial and disbelief created further barriers to discovery. The practical and emotional impacts on both cyberscam survivors with ABI and their family members, and a lack of effective intervention, highlight the need for increased education and awareness in order to improve online safety for those with ABI.
Technological advances have changed the manner in which ordinary citizens conduct their daily activities. Many of these activities are carried out over the Internet. These include filling tax returns, online banking, job searching and general socialising. Increased bandwidth and proliferation of mobile phones with access to Internet in South Africa imply increased access to Internet by the South African population. Such massive increased in access to Internet increases vulnerabilities to cyber crime and attacks and threatens the national security. As a result, South Africa remains one of top three countries that are targeted by phishing attacks, the other two are the US and the UK (RSA, 2011). As a response, various entities engage in cyber security awareness initiatieves and trainings with the aim to create cyber security awareness (CSA) among the citizens of South Africa. In the absence of a national cyber security policy, however, these awareness initiatives and programmes are delivered through a variety of independent mechanisms. Various entities engage in cyber security awareness training each with its specific objectives and focus areas. It is argued in this paper that cyber security is complex and multi-faceted. No single solution can effectively address it. While the current means to create cyber security awareness does make impact, the fragmented and uncoordinated nature thereof have a potential to create its own dynamics. The focus of organisations to deliver on their own objectives translates to some extent into the optimisation of the behaviour of individual entities as opposed to the optimisation of the national cyber security awareness as a whole. This paper evaluates the extent to which the current cyber security awareness initiatives address the cyber security threats and risks. The assessment is based on the initiatives objectives, alignment of the programme to the cyber threats, and the target audience.
Increasing numbers of social media users report being blackmailed on social media following their sharing of sensitive and personal information. However, little is known about this emerging crime and its victims. Using a survey of adult WhatsApp users in Oman (n = 1452) and interviews (n = 18) with victims and Omani criminal justice professionals, this study addresses this gap by examining the prevalence of blackmail among adult WhatsApp users arising from their voluntary self-disclosures, as well as the characteristics and vulnerabilities of those who fall victim to this activity. New insights are also offered into the factors influencing victim's decisions to report their experiences to criminal justice professionals, as well as the challenges associated with investigating and prosecuting this activity.
While there are no new frauds, internet technology provides new opportunities for fraudsters by facilitating volumes of attacks that law enforcement then struggles to address. Moreover, since context can affect how potential victims respond to frauds, crisis context influences how fraudsters design frauds. This article assesses fraudsters' fraud design strategies during two external crisis events that impacted Australia: The Black Summer Bushfires that occurred from September 2019 to March 2020 and the onset and first year of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred from January 2020 through January 2021. Targets, during these crises, were more likely to be vulnerable according to Steinmetz's model victim for social engineering framework. This study shows that, in both crises, fraudsters deployed the social engineering techniques of authority and scarcity, techniques that are more likely to be successful based solely on initial contact. Fraudsters designed their requests to be easily actioned and crafted their scams to reference very recent events as the external crisis events evolved. Thus, they targeted broad audiences with minimal personal involvement. Furthermore, this study shows that fraudsters, when disseminating their scams via sodas media outlets, attempted to build social proof to expand their potential victim pool to include the marks' social circles.
Bullying and stalking through cyberspace have become serious phenomena in the Internet era, impacting mainly young users and teenagers. Many tragic incidents have occurred, especially in the West, including self-harm and suicide due to these problems. To protect the victims many countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada have codified laws dealing with cyber-crimes, including cyber-harassment. To determine the adequacy of such laws in addressing these issues, we present in this paper a legal analysis of the existing anti-bullying and stalking laws in the UAE, US, UK, and Canada. The purpose is to gain perspective on the characteristics of the laws and their ability to protect society from various forms of crimes associated with cyberbullying and cyberstalking. The paper also presents recommendations to help combat cyberbullying and cyberstalking and protect our youth from these issues.
Abuses of online anonymity make identity tracing a critical problem in cybercrime investigation. To solve this problem, this paper focuses on the feature of authors' behavior in time slices and tries to mine the association of multiple virtual identities based on multi-agent interaction. We propose the recognition model MVIA-K based on knowledge management. In MVIA-K, agents perform distributed mining to get candidate author groups as local knowledge in each time slice. Then high-quality knowledge is extracted from the local knowledge and used as priori knowledge to guide other agents' mining process. Finally distributed knowledge is integrated on the basis of knowledge scale. Experiment with real-world dataset shows that MVIA-K has a very promising performance, which can filter the noise data effectively and outperform Author Topic model.
Deepfake and digitally altered nude and sexual imagery is a serious and harmful emerging form of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA). This article reports on a multi-methods and cross-country study of IBSA across the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, with a specific focus on the creation, distribution and threat to distribute deepfake and digitally altered imagery. Our findings suggest this abuse involves poly-victimization and poly-perpetration, and is disproportionately experienced and engaged in by those with mobility and/or communication assistance needs, members of the LGB+ community, males, young people and racial minorities (perpetration only). In this article, we discuss the pervasiveness and harms of deepfake and digitally altered imagery abuse, as well as challenges in legal responses, policing and prevention.
"Purpose This paper aims to help build awareness with financial institutions about the money laundering risks posed by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules and theme assures that financial institution scan adopt to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as Money Mules. Design/methodology/approach The research took the form of a desk study, which analysed various documents and reports such as a 2019 report on Money Mules by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL); a 2019 and 2020 report on Money Mules by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Better Business Bureau (BBB); the Financial Action Task Force Guidance on the Risk Based Approach to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (High Level Principles and Procedures) 2007; the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations 2012; the United Kingdom's Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017; the United States Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual 2014; Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2018; The UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended); the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part I June 2017 (Amended December 2017); the United States Codified Bank Secrecy Act Regulations (31 CFR); the Nigerian Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 (as amended); and the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part II: Sectoral Guidance June 2017 (Amended December 2017). Findings This paper determined that financial institutions may be able to prevent proceeds of crime from being laundered by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules if they focus monitoring resources on the emotionally vulnerable customers like newcomers to the country, unemployed people who may have lost their jobs because of a pandemic like COVID-19, students and those in economic hardship; pay very close attention to the country of origin where the funds emanate from; pay very close attention to the country where the funds are being transferred to; and pay close attention to frequent large cash deposits followed by wire transfers. Originality/value While most articles focus on the money laundering risk(s) associated with Money Mules and the measures that individuals can use to ensure that their bank accounts are not used by criminals to launder illicit funds, this paper focuses on the different mechanisms that banks can use to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as Money Mules. This paper recommends a proportional approach that balances anti-money laundering measures, financial inclusion and human rights. The mechanisms/measures which have been extensively discussed in this paper will help banks to identify, assess and understand their money laundering and terrorist financing risks as it relates to Money Mules and take commensurate measures to mitigate them."
In the computer network crime and network security means defense technology escalating the situation, a growing number of technical and legal experts come to realize, is completely dependent on network security technology to combat computer-related crime can not be very effective, it must apply the law deterrent sanctions and technical preparedness to jointly curb cybercrime, Network Forensic technology is in this situation and developed, it belongs to an active network security defenses. But whether it is the concept of network forensics technology or greater extension of the scope of Computer Forensic technology, it has not yet formed the theory, method and system of systems. Computer forensics technology has become a hot research topic in recent years, the field of computer science and law intersect, this paper presents a study on electronic data forensics system based on C/S structure.
The internet has become a popular marketplace for the sale of illicit products, including stolen personal information, drugs, and firearms. Many of these products are acquired using cryptocurrencies, which are generally defined as forms of digital currency that is traceable through blockchain ledger technology. These currencies are thought to be more secure than other forms of digital payment, though law enforcement and financial service providers have found ways to investigate account holders and their transactions. Consequently, several service providers have begun to offer cryptomixing services, which effectively launders payments to circumvent detection and investigation tools. Few have explored the practices of cryptomixing services, or the ways in which they are marketed on the Open and Dark Web. This inductive qualitative analysis will examine a sample of 18 cryptomixing services advertised on both the Open and Dark Web to better understand cryptomixing and its role in facilitating illicit transactions across the internet.
The core of this article is a detailed investigation of the dispute resolution system contained within Darkode, an elite cybercriminal forum. Extracting the dedicated disputes section from within the marketplace, where users can report bad behavior and register complaints, we carry out content analysis on these threads. This involves both descriptive statistics across the data set and qualitative analysis of particular posts of interest, leading to a number of new insights. First, the overall level of disputes is quite high, even though members are vetted for entry in the first instance. Second, the lower ranked members of the marketplace are the most highly represented category for both the plaintiffs and defendants. Third, vendors are accused of malfeasance far more often than buyers, and their crimes are most commonly either not providing the product/service or providing a poor one. Fourth, the monetary size of the disputes is surprisingly small. Finally, only 23.1% of disputes reach a clear outcome.
With the development of Internet technologies, both the positive aspects of the Internet space and the adverse ones did not rest. The development of online fraud has become one of the main threats to the safe use of Internet resources. People who do not have sufficient Internet security skills are increasingly falling into the digital traps of scammers. However, the existing domestic legislation of Russia does not always manage to respond to new trends arising in modern crime. Therefore, new dangerous actions committed in the digital environment often remain beyond the scope of the law, and attackers remain unpunished. First of all, the point is in petty offenses committed in the digital environment (with damage up to 2,500 rubles), which, in principle, cannot be solved. This circumstance determines the relevance of the research topic. The relevance of the study is provided by the fact that the amount of damage caused by crimes in the virtual space in recent years has grown many times. The scientific novelty of this paper lies in the fact that, taking into account available research and existing legislation, questions about the causes and characteristics of crimes and delinquencies in the digital environment are revealed more than ever before.
Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a method of information hiding that is only possible on NTFS file systems. Criminals are using it to hide data because the ADS can hide any size and type of data in NTFS file system. ADS is invisible to users. However, ADS operation updates the temporal attribute of cover medium, which could be a trace for ADS evaluating. Cover medium indicates to the file/folder which is used for ADS operation (creating, modifying and overwriting). In general file/folder operation, if we create (archive/copy) a file into folder, it updates certain timestamps attributes of folder and file itself. Same result takes place when modifying/overwriting the file within folder. Based on this concept, we took a file within folder as a cover medium and applied some operations (create, modify and overwrite) on it to observe the timestamps variation on both folder and cover medium.
This paper describes the origins of security economics. The birth of this thriving new discipline is sometimes credited to a talk I gave at ACSAC in December 2001, but the story is more complex. After sabbatical visits to Berkeley in 20012 to work with Hal Varian, we organised the first Workshop on the Economics of Information Security in June 2002. Since then the field has grown to encompass arguments over open versus proprietary systems, the econometrics of online crime, the behavioural economics of security and much else. It has started to have a significant impact on policy, with security-economics studies of cybercrime and infrastructure vulnerability being adopted as policy in the EU, while security economics PhDs have got influential jobs in the White House and elsewhere.
Phishing assaults are one of the more prevalent types of cybercrime in the world today. To steal information, users are sent emails and messages. Moreover, websites are used for it. Phishing primarily targets corporate websites, such as those for e commerce, finance, and governmental organizations. To obtain sensitive user information, attackers impersonate websites, a phenomenon known as phishing. In addition to exploring the use of machine learning algorithms to identify and stop web phishing assaults, this research suggests utilizing machine learning techniques to detect phishing URLs by analyzing various aspects of the URLs. The study includes classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision trees, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and other ensemble learning techniques like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Histogram Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting, and Ada Boost were used to detect phishing websites.
Estonia has successfully created a digital society within the past 2 decades. It is best known for its eGovernment achievements, but it is also home for four unicorn star-ups. While the state is aiming to attract tech investments with e-Residency program and has recently started to invest into protecting national IP and safeguarding data from cybercrime by applying blockchain technology and creating its digital embassy in Luxembourg, emerging technologies such as and applications of artificial intelligence but also internet of things have posed the question on legal regulation and standardization. The dilemma, however, seems to be that since the new technologies, such artificial intelligence is much more overwhelming phenomenon than e-governance and presumably, before deciding the legal standards, the political and economic strategies that go beyond the e-governance should be set.
"The distribution of child sexual exploitation (CE) material has been aided by the growth of the Internet. The graphic nature and prevalence of the material has made researching and combating difficult. Although used to study online CE distribution, automated data collection tools (e.g., webcrawlers) have yet to be shown effective at targeting only relevant data. Using CE-related image and keyword criteria, we compare networks starting from CE websites to those from similar non-CE sexuality websites and dissimilar sports websites. Our results provide evidence that (a) webcrawlers have the potential to provide valid CE data, if the appropriate criterion is selected; (b) CE distribution is still heavily image-based suggesting images as an effective criterion; (c) CE-seeded networks are more hub-based and differ from non-CE-seeded networks on several website characteristics. Recommendations for improvements to reliable criteria selection are discussed."
Tampered multimedia content is increasingly being used in a broad range of cybercrime activities. The spread of fake news, misinformation, digital kidnapping, and ransomware-related crimes are among the most recurrent crimes in which manipulated digital photos are being used as an attacking vector. One of the linchpins of accurately detecting manipulated multimedia content is the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This work proposed a dataset of photos and videos suitable for digital forensics, which has been used to benchmark Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolution Neural Networks algorithms (CNN). An SVM-based module for the Autopsy digital forensics open-source application has also been developed. This was evaluated as a very capable and useful forensic tool, winning second place on the OSDFCon international Autopsy modules competition.
Criminological literature on crime and deviance in cyberspace has boomed in recent years with most studies focusing on computer integrity crimes, computer content crimes and financial cybercrimes, also discussing the opportunity to consider some of these crimes as profit-driven forms of organised crime. The existing literature, however, has not addressed extensively yet the impact of the emergence and proliferation of cyber affordances on forms of state-organized crime - a conceptualization that since the late '80 s proved successful in shedding light, among other things, on the relationships among social structures and criminality. Seeking to address this gap, this conceptual contribution focuses on state-cybercrimes, where illegal, harmful or unjust cyber activities are committed for the benefit of a state or its agencies, offering a macro-typology to shed light on how cyber affordances are influencing and transforming the state-crime relations.
The emergence of the deadly global respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019 claimed many lives and altered the way people live and behave as well as how companies operated. Considerable pressure was exerted on Institutions of Higher Learning (universities) to salvage the academic projects through the process of business model reconfiguration. Students were required to study remotely and were, therefore, exposed to phishing and scamming cyber-attacks. The effects of these attacks were examined in this study with the support of literature and empirical research leading to appropriate recommendations being proposed. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews from students at a selected public-funded university. Atlas.Ti was used for data analysis to identify usable and sensible themes. The study established that students were aware of the factors that exposed them to phishing and scamming attacks but lacked the skills to identify such attacks before becoming victims.
Cyberattacks are becoming more and more advanced, making it more difficult to identify suspicious activities on network traffic. Weaponizing the data in the line between network attacks and data breaches continues and the number rises upward even during the recent year with a massive increase in the attack type. Many consider Intrusion Detection System (IDS) datasets publicly available are becoming outdated and inadequate due to the availability of newer attack techniques. Therefore, it is a concern that the extensive usage of these available datasets in the current attack scenario to evaluate IDS models. This paper lists 37 datasets available for testing the IDS models and discusses those publicly accessible datasets, describing the characteristics and limitations for researchers who use such datasets. Finally, based on the dataset characteristics and usage survey, we conclude with a summary of the problems and provide our insights and suggestions for the use of network-based datasets for the Deep Learning approach for further improvement.
The rapid rise of the Dark Web and supportive technologies has served as the backbone facilitating online illegal activity worldwide. These illegal activities supported by anonymisation technologies such as Tor has made it increasingly elusive to law enforcement agencies. Despite several successful law enforcement operations, illegal activity on the Dark Web is still growing. There are approaches to monitor, mine, and research the Dark Web, all with varying degrees of success. Given the complexity and dynamics of the services offered, we recognize the need for in depth analysis of the Dark Web with regard to its infrastructures, actors, types of abuse and their relationships. This involves the challenging task of information extraction from the very heterogeneous collection of web pages that make up the Dark Web. Most providers develop their services on top of standard frameworks such as WordPress, Simple Machine Forum, phpBB and several other frameworks to deploy their services. As a result, these service providers publish significant number of pages based on similar structural and stylistic templates. We propose an efficient, scalable, repeatable and accurate approach to cluster Dark Web pages based on those structural and stylistic features. Extracting relevant information from those clusters should make it feasible to conduct in depth Dark Web analysis. This paper presents our clustering algorithm to accelerate information extraction, and as a result improve attribution of digital traces to infrastructures or individuals in the fight against cyber crime.
The abuse of free web-based services has been raised in today's cyber world. In response, researchers have developed security mechanisms to protect users and system resources from misuse. However, attackers are increasingly finding new ways to avoid detection by these mechanisms. As a consequence, new and improved security mechanisms are in constant need of development, which may be a challenge in terms of cost. Increased security may also impair the usability of the web-based services. As such, there is often a clear trade-off between the variables of: security level, usability and cost. This paper therefore proposes approaches that can effectively handle this trade-off.
The deliberate misuse of technical infrastructure (including the Web and social media) for cyber deviant and cybercriminal behaviour, ranging from the spreading of extremist and terrorism related material to online fraud and cyber security attacks, is on the rise. This workshop aims to better understand such phenomena and develop methods for tackling them in an effective and efficient manner The workshop brings together interdisciplinary researchers and experts in Web search, security informatics, social media analysis, machine learning, and digital forensics, with particular interests in cyber security. The workshop programme includes refereed papers, invited talks and a panel discussion for better understanding the current landscape, as well as the future of data mining for detecting cyber deviance.
Cloud computing as an extensive IT service delivery platform is one of the most promising technologies for rapid business development and operational efficiency improvement. Unfortunately, many of the attractive cloud computing attributes can be utilized for cybercrime purposes and illegal activities. Effective combat of these cybercrimes requires careful application of digital forensics practice in the cloud computing environment. This refers not just to the adoption of specific technical methodologies or tools for cloud forensic investigation, but also to serious consideration of the legal and privacy aspects of this investigation. Accordingly, through this paper we discuss the potential impact of the cloud forensics on privacy in the cloud computing environment, and offer several recommendations for adoption of privacy aware cloud forensic investigation process.
Young people's use of online communication has increasingly become a concern for policy-makers, professionals, and parents. Sharing personal information and grooming or sexual solicitation by online predators have been prominent on the list of dangers. However, little research exists to support fears. This paper reviews the data we do have and shows that, far from being a major problem, the risks from online communication are small-scale and largely focused upon particular groups within the population. Furthermore, they are often misrepresented by safety campaigns and largely within the competencies of young people to manage. It goes on to argue that the over-zealous risk discourse may prevent many benefits of online communication being experienced by young people. Furthermore, the potential for using communication tools as policy vehicles has been largely ignored. The paper concludes by suggesting how risk discourses can be refined to more accurately reflect reality and also how professionals can harness the potential of online communication to benefit young people's lives.
Cybercrime has become an integral part of the transnational threat landscape and conjures up pressing images of nefarious and increasingly complex online activity. More recently, the concept of 'organised crime' has been attributed to cybercriminality. There has been subsequent disagreement and confusion concerning whether such crime is a derivation of traditional organised crime or an evolution of such crime within the online space. This opaque state of affairs has been exacerbated by the relative lack of clear evidence attesting to and supporting either scenario. Technological advances have always been used to the advantage of the criminal fraternity. The crucial question that remains is whether those advances have merely facilitated the commission of physical crime or whether in fact they have led to the creation of a new wave of traditional, but virtual, organised crime.
In recent years, a number of network forensics techniques have been proposed to investigate the increasing number of cybercrimes. Network forensics techniques assist in tracking internal and external network attacks by focusing on inherent network vulnerabilities and communication mechanisms. However, investigation of cybercrime becomes more challenging when cyber criminals erase the traces in order to avoid detection. Therefore, network forensics techniques employ mechanisms to facilitate investigation by recording every single packet and event that is disseminated into the network. As a result, it allows identification of the origin of the attack through reconstruction of the recorded data. In the current literature, network forensics techniques are studied on the basis of forensic tools, process models and framework implementations. However, a comprehensive study of cybercrime investigation using network forensics frameworks along with a critical review of present network forensics techniques is lacking. In other words, our study is motivated by the diversity of digital evidence and the difficulty of addressing numerous attacks in the network using network forensics techniques. Therefore, this paper reviews the fundamental mechanism of network forensics techniques to determine how network attacks are identified in the network. Through an extensive review of related literature, a thematic taxonomy is proposed for the classification of current network forensics techniques based on its implementation as well as target data sets involved in the conducting of forensic investigations. The critical aspects and significant features of the current network forensics techniques are investigated using qualitative analysis technique. We derive significant parameters from the literature for discussing the similarities and differences in existing network forensics techniques. The parameters include framework nature, mechanism, target dataset, target instance, forensic processing, time of investigation, execution definition, and objective function. Finally, open research challenges are discussed in network forensics to assist researchers in selecting the appropriate domains for further research and obtain ideas for exploring optimal techniques for investigating cyber-crimes.

The recent development in Information Communication Technology (ICT) has made changes in every aspect in our life. These changes are clearly reflected in cyberspace-related areas. The positive influence of cyberspace on knowledge, trade and business, and communication is undoubtable. However, there is a dark side of cyberspace deteriorates its peaceful usage that is cybercrimes. Cybercrimes arc defined as any illegal activities practiced by or done via cyberspace and its electronic environment. Unlike traditional crimes, cybercrimes present a real dilemma due to the fact that criminals' identity may be hidden or fraud in virtual domain. The concept of digital forensics have come to the existence in an attempt of formulating possible ways for cybercrimes investigation and analysis process. In this paper, we deplore the concept of digital forensics in the context of cybercrimes. An investigation of the positive impact of digital forensics in combating cybercrimes is discussed and useful remarks on open research issues are provided for further investigation activities.
Many threats in the real world can be related to activity of persons on the internet. Internet surveillance aims to predict and prevent attacks and to assist in finding suspects based on information from the web. However, the amount of data on the internet rapidly increases and it is time consuming to monitor many websites. In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically monitor trends and find anomalies on the internet. The system was tested on Twitter data. The results showed that it can successfully recognize abnormal changes in activity or emotion.
Digital image fraudulent has become a very dangerous problem because of the rapidly growing media editing software. The information on the digital image can be easily replaced by fake information. Several cybercrime activities are attempted by hacking the digital images. Due to the presence of various kinds of media editing software, the digital image authenticity is very much significant. Nowadays, the detection of the manipulated images and localization of the manipulated regions are important issues. Many efforts have been made over the past decade to detect the tampered images and localization of the tampered regions with high accuracy based on some specially designed mechanisms. This paper presents a detailed survey of existing approaches for detecting tampered images and localization of the tampered regions.
With the increasing information being shared online, the vast potential for cybercrime is a serious issue for individuals and businesses. Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a way for distribution of secure key between two communicating parties. However, the current Quantum Key Distribution method, BB84 protocol, is prone to several weaknesses. These are Photon-Number-Splitting (PNS) attack, high Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), and low raw key efficiency. Thus, the objectives of this paper are to investigate the impacts of BB84 protocol towards QBER and raw key efficiencies in single quantum channel. Experiments were set up using a QKD simulator that was developed in Java NetBeans. The simulation study has reaffirmed the results of QBER and raw key efficiencies for the single quantum channel BB84 protocol.
With the ever-growing use of social media, authorship attribution plays an important role in avoiding cybercrime, and helping the analysis of online trails left behind by cyber pranks, stalkers, bullies, identity thieves and alike. In this paper, we propose a method for authorship attribution in micro-blogs with efficiency one hundred to a thousand times faster than state-of-the-art counterparts. The method relies on a powerful and scalable feature representation approach taking advantage of user patterns in micro-blog messages, and also on a custom-tailored pattern classifier adapted to deal with big data and high-dimensional data. Finally, we discuss search-space reduction when analyzing hundreds of online suspects and millions of online micro messages, which makes this approach invaluable for digital forensics and law enforcement.
This paper investigates the mathematical modelling of cybercrime attacks on multiple devices connected to the server. This model is a very successful way for cybercrime, bio-mathematics, and artificial intelligence to investigate and comprehend the behaviour of mannerisms with harmful intentions in a computer system. In this computational model, we are studying the factors (i.e., computer viruses, disease infections, and cyberattacks) that affect connected devices. This compartmental model, SEIAR, represents the various hardware utilised during the cyberattack. The letters S, E, I, A, and R are used to represent different stages or groups of individuals in epidemiological models, helping to understand the spread and control of infectious diseases. The dynamics of the previous model are determined by a series of differential equations. The dynamics of the preceding model are determined by a system of differential equations. Numerical solutions of the model are calculated using backpropagated Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (BLMA) and a specific optimization algorithm known as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA). Reference solutions were obtained by using the Runge-Kutta algorithm of order 4 (RK-4). The backpropagated Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (BLMA), commonly known as the damped least-squares (DLS) method. Subsequently, we endeavor to analyze the surrogate solutions obtained for the system and determine the stability of our approach. Moreover, we aim to ascertain fitting curves to the target solutions with minimum errors and achieve a regression value of 1 for all the predicted solutions. The outcome of our simulations ensures that our approach is capable of making precise predictions concerning the behavior of real-world phenomena under varying circumstances. The testing, validation, and training of our technique concerning the reference solutions are then used to determine the accuracy of the surrogate solutions obtained by BLMA. Convergence analysis, error histograms, regression analysis, and curve fitting were used for each differential equation to examine the robustness and accuracy of the design strategy.
Cyber security awareness among smartphone users is becoming one of the main challenges of cyber security in both developed and developing countries. This paper focuses on Thailand, a developing country that is ranked among the riskiest countries in the world with regards to cybercrime. Through a survey exploring the knowledge and practices of Thai student smartphone owners, as the young population is the largest user group, we seek to estimate the level of their cyber security awareness about the most common risks. The findings reveal that they are most susceptible to identity theft or data compromise, while they were on the whole found to have a higher level of security awareness than students in other countries. We argue for Thailand's digital economy to be sustainable, ICT4D projects need to extend their focus to this population of smartphone users to increase security awareness.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to formulate a novel model for enhancing the effectiveness of existing digital forensic readiness (DFR) schemes by leveraging the capabilities of cyber threat information sharing. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a quantitative methodology to identify the most popular cyber threat intelligence (CTI) elements and introduces a lightweight approach to correlate those with potential forensic value, resulting in the quick and accurate triaging and identification of patterns of malicious activities. Findings While threat intelligence exchange steadily becomes a common practice for the prevention or detection of security incidents, the proposed approach highlights its usefulness for the digital forensics (DF) domain. Originality/value The proposed model can help organizations to improve their DFR posture, and thus minimize the time and cost of cybercrime incidents.
While this article sets out to advance our knowledge about the characteristics of Nigerian cybercriminals (Yahoo-Boys), it is also the first study to explore the narratives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) officers concerning them. It appraises symbolic interactionist insights to consider the ways in which contextual factors and worldview may help to illuminate officers' narratives of cybercriminals and the interpretations and implications of such accounts. Semi-structured interviews of forty frontline EFCC officers formed the empirical basis of this study and were subjected to a directed approach of qualitative content analysis. While prior studies, for example, indicated that only a group of cybercriminals deploy spiritual and magical powers to defraud victims (i.e. modus operandi), our data analysis extended this classification into more refined levels involving multiple features. In particular, analysis bifurcates cybercriminals and their operations based on three factors: educational-attainment, modus-operandi, and networks-collaborators. Results also suggest that these cybercriminals and their operations are embedded in masculinity-and-material-wealth. These contributions thus have implications for a range of generally accepted viewpoints about these cybercriminals previously taken-for-granted. Since these criminals have victims all over the world, insights from our study may help various local and international agencies [a] to understand the actions/features of these two groups of cybercriminals better and develop more effective response strategies. [b] to appreciate the vulnerabilities of their victims better and develop more adequate support schemes. We also consider the limitations of social control agents' narratives on criminals.
The information warfare can hit and completely break down critical IT infrastructure of an organization or a country. Cybercrime has many types, but, in this paper we have focused on DDoS attack into a computer network to spread bots throughout the network. DDoS attack can be used to sabotage a service or as a cover for bots delivery. In this paper an epidemic SIS - SEIRS model is proposed to represent the propagation of bots in computer network through DDoS attack. A mathematical model is also formulated to represent the dynamism of the members of different compartments of the model. The model provides an epidemic framework consisting of two sub frameworks to represent the internal class of nodes and external class of nodes. Numerical methods are employed to solve and simulate the system of equations developed. Results of numerical simulations are obtained using MATLAB.
In recent years, the disclosure of secrets through cyber infiltration of America's largest intelligence organization, the National Security Agency (NSA), has raised the fears of veteran intelligence officials and close allies around the globe that no institution or government is secure from those who roam the discrete halls of cyberspace. Although espionage has existed since before the days of the Greek mythological Trojan horse, no one could have envisioned the sophisticated use of espionage in today's networked world. Espionage has been used for political and military intelligence and economic and industrial pursuits with a lack of understanding of all of the impacts on our daily lives. In the context of foreign or international law, espionage is sometimes characterized as lawless, without controls or regulation, and it rarely distinguishes between economic and security based cyber espionage. Through empirical analysis this paper explores the treatment of espionage under various legal systems including those countries and regions considered the most advanced at cyber espionage, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. To provide greater insight into the different perspectives of cyber espionage from a legal standpoint, this paper distinguishes the law of national intelligence collection from the criminal laws of economic/industrial espionage on the domestic front. The purpose of this research is to analyze the development of cyber espionage as a preferred means of contemporary warfare, as well as a tool for economic and political intelligence. The paper concludes by responding to the challenges faced by nation-states in the development of an effective legal system governing espionage at the domestic and international level.
With the widespread use of encryption techniques in network instant messaging applications, encrypted traffic has become a great challenge for digital surveillance. As the threats of frauds and deceptions in social media communications have increased, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) face tremendous problems in identifying anonymous suspects. Although the transferred message is encrypted, there are some digital trace evidences on the end users' Internet protocol (IP) address. This paper aims to investigate an effective mechanism to analyze the IP address of the voice over IP (VoIP) caller without any help from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or other LEAs. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that integrates a decision tree by sniffing the LINE application VoIP network packets at the client-user side. Our proposed IP-address detection strategy can handle the identification of the end user. A decision-tree approach was adopted to analyze the target's remote IP address of VoIP calls in four scenarios. The accuracy rate for identifying the speaker's IP address for the decision tree was 65.1%. To improve the detection rates, other machine algorithms can be developed in future research.
The rise of malware attack and data leakage is putting the Internet at a higher risk. Digital forensic examiners responsible for cyber security incident need to continually update their processes, knowledge and tools due to changing technology. These attack activities can be investigated by means of Digital Triage Forensics (DTF) methodologies. DTF is a procedural model for the crime scene investigation of digital forensic applications. It takes place as a way of gathering quick intelligence, and presents methods of conducting pre/post-blast investigations. A DTF framework of Window malware forensic toolkit is further proposed. It is also based on ISO/IEC 27037: 2012 - guidelines for specific activities in the handling of digital evidence. The argument is made for a careful use of digital forensic investigations to improve the overall quality of expert examiners. This solution may improve the speed and quality of pre/post-blast investigations. By considering how triage solutions are being implemented into digital investigations, this study presents a critical analysis of malware forensics. The analysis serves as feedback for integrating digital forensic considerations, and specifies directions for further standardization efforts.
Open data promotes transparency and accountability as everyone can analyse it. Law enforcement and the judiciary are increasingly making data available, to increase trust and confidence in the criminal justice system. Due to privacy legislation, judicial open data - like court judgements - in Europe is usually anonymized. And even if the court judgement has been made public, the rest of the case file is usually not published. Therefore, the question arises to what extent criminological research into sentencing can make use of anonymized open data. We answer this question based on a case study in which we use the open data of the Dutch criminal justice system that is available on . Over the period 2015-2020, we analysed sentencing in 25,366 court judgements and investigated the relationship between sentence severity and the offender's use of advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The most important results are, firstly, that offenders who use advanced ICT are sentenced to longer custodial sentences compared to other offenders. Secondly, sentencing research with open data is found to be feasible.
By nearly every metric, the status quo of information security is not working. The interaction matrix of attacker-defender dynamics strongly favors the attacker who only needs to be lucky once. We argue that employing social engineering active defense (SEAD) will be more effective to countering malicious actors than maintaining the traditional passive defensive strategy. The Offensive Countermeasures (OCM) approach to defense advocates for three categories of countermeasures: annoyance, attribution, and attack. Annoyance aims to waste the attacker's time and resources with the objective of not only deterrence but also to increase the probability of detection and attribution. Attribution attempts to identify who is launching the attack. Gathering as much threat intelligence on who the attacker is, provides the best possible defense against future attacks. Finally, attack involves running code on the attacker's system for the purpose of deterrence and attribution. In this work, we advocate for utilizing similar approaches to deny, degrade, and de-anonymize malicious actors by using social engineering tools, tactics, and procedures against the attackers. Rather than fearing the threats posed by synthetic media, cyber defenders should embrace these capabilities by turning these against criminals. Future research should explore ways to implement synthetic media and automated SEAD methods to degrade the capabilities of online malicious actors.
"The substantial improvements in development information and communication technologies led many economic and non-economic implications for the countries and in turn motivated the researchers to question the various effects of ICT especially in the light of economic crime. This study explores the short and long run influence of information and communication technologies on the shadow economy in 11 post-transition EU members over 1996-2015 period through second generation panel cointegration and causality tests regarding the cross-sectional dependence. The economic analyses disclosed that ICT indicators and human development had significant effects on the size of shadow economy in both short and long run. It was found that growing ICTs lead to reduction on the size of the shadow economy; in addition, human capital improvement policies serve as an important factor when tackling the shadow economy."
Malware perception is an important technique which has to be explored to analyze the corpus amount of malware in short duration for effective disaster management. Accurate analyses of malware must be done by detecting them in initial stage in an automatic way to avoid severe damage in Internet of Thing devices. This is enabled by visualizing malware by using a software-defined visual analytic system. Though many auto analysis techniques are present visualization of malware is one of the effective techniques preferred for large analysis. Malware exhibits malicious behavior on computing devices by installing harmful software such as viruses. The existing static and dynamic form of malware detection is an inefficient technique as it involve in disassembling of malicious code. In this project, the visualization of malware in the form of images is proposed in order to find the malicious insertion on the executable files of computing devices for extreme surveillance. The malware detection becomes easier to visualize the malicious behavior in form of images by feature based classification of images as the global property of exe gray scale image is unchanged. This will be an eye open in healing the security issues in cyber-crime and provide extreme surveillance.
Nowadays, the rise of cybercrime requires the companies to empower their business with innovative defensive mechanisms. This article focuses on the security of APIs and it proposes two methods to defend them against different types of injection attacks. The analyzed APIs belong to a large scale company and they respond to more than 10 000 requests per second, coming from applications that belong to totally different business domains. At the foundation of these solutions is the usage of the powerful Long Short Term Memory network and two different tokenization strategies: a word-level and a character-level. The solutions outperform the current model used by the company and they are able to detect an injection attack tentative sent by a client with 96% accuracy, in comparison with the model employed, which only achieves 92% accuracy.
"Database forensics is a domain that uses database content and metadata to reveal malicious activities on database systems in an Internet of Things environment. Although the concept of database forensics has been around for a while, the investigation of cybercrime activities and cyber breaches in an Internet of Things environment would benefit from the development of a common investigative standard that unifies the knowledge in the domain. Therefore, this paper proposes common database forensic investigation processes using a design science research approach. The proposed process comprises four phases, namely: 1) identification; 2) artefact collection; 3) artefact analysis; and 4) the documentation and presentation process. It allows the reconciliation of the concepts and terminologies of all common database forensic investigation processes; hence, it facilitates the sharing of knowledge on database forensic investigation among domain newcomers, users, and practitioners."
Contrary to committing hacking offences, becoming a victim of hacking has received scant research attention. This article addresses risk factors for this type of crime and explores its theoretical and empirical connectedness to the more commonly studied type of cybercrime victimization: online harassment. The results show that low self-control acts as a general risk factor in two ways. First, it leads to a higher risk of experiencing either one of these two distinct types of victimization within a 1-year period. Second, cumulatively the experiences of being hacked and harassed are also more prominent among this group. However, specific online behaviors predicted specific online victimization types (e.g., using social media predicted only harassment and not hacking). The results thus shed more light on the extent to which criminological theories are applicable across different types of Internet-related crime.
Advance Fee Fraud (AFF) is amongst the most prevalent and destructive forms of cybercrime. Scammers typically commit AFF by tricking victims into making upfront payments for goods or services that are never provided. These payments are small compared to the alleged gains, and can thus be attractive for victims, particularly if they are vulnerable or in a heightened emotional state. Given that approximately three billion fraudulent emails are sent every day, the scale and impact of AFF demands innovative approaches. In this paper we document the development of an automated victim for AFF. The system leverages GPT-3, a large language model, in conjunction with deliberately engineered prompts to generate plausible responses to AFF emails, allowing fraud to be disrupted and actionable information relating to perpetrators to be obtained.
Internet of Things (IoT) is a new domain which is designed to make human lives more comfortable and convenient. Conversely, it has also raised issues of security and privacy as a data-driven could-based ecosystem. IoT technology raises challenges for digital forensics investigators when working on cybercrime or digital intrusions. Among these challenges, protacting consumer privacy when conducting investigations is important and difficult. Currently, literature has shown that there is not a single agreed upon IoT-forensic standard model that can protect privacy of 3rd party consumers. This research will address this limitation by developing a privacy-aware IoT forensics model. In this paper, by mapping the ISO/IEC 27037 standard to the three layered reference architecture of IoT, the authors discuss the breach of privacy that may happen when investigating an IoT environment.
The increasing use of smartphones and cloud storage apps allows users to access their data anywhere, anytime. Due to the potential of mobile devices being used and/or targeted by criminals, such devices are an important source of evidence in investigations of both cybercrime and traditional crimes, such as drug trafficking. In this paper, we study the MEGA cloud client app, an increasingly popular alternative to Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive, on both Android and iOS platforms. In our study, we identify a range of artefacts arising from user activities, such as login, uploading, downloading, deletion, and the sharing of files, which could be forensically recovered, as well as findings such as modification of files' timestamps. Our findings contribute to an up-to-date understanding of cloud storage forensics.
The current increase in cybercrime is demanding more effective and efficient data exploration and analysis solutions that can help analysts to detect cyberattacks. However, the huge amount of data generated continuously confronts a number of technological difficulties and classical algorithms must be often redesigned to be able to deal with this seemingly endless stream of information coming from past activity logs and real-time data. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology able to identify security threats in activity logs. The contribution of the paper is twofold: we propose an encoding technique, based on prime numbers, that can be used to represent in a compact way a set of activities, we then describe an outlier detection algorithm which, based on the encoded activities, is able to detect malicious behavior. The extensive experimental analysis proved the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
We describe a new supervised machine learning approach for detecting authorship deception, a specific type of authorship attribution task particularly relevant for cybercrime forensic investigations, and demonstrate its validity on two case studies drawn from realistic online data sets. The core of our approach involves identifying uncharacteristic behavior for an author, based on a writeprint extracted from unstructured text samples of the author's writing. The writeprints used here involve stylometric features and content features derived from topic models, an unsupervised approach for identifying relevant keywords that relate to the content areas of a document. One innovation of our approach is to transform the writeprint feature values into a representation that individually balances characteristic and uncharacteristic traits of an author, and we subsequently apply a Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression classifier to this novel representation. Our method yields high accuracy for authorship deception detection on the two case studies, confirming its utility.
Our research explores the Italian banking sector. In particular it focuses on the analysis of the cyber risk management in Bene Banca, a Credit Cooperative Bank (BCC) in the North-West of Italy. This research represents a case study that can help us understand the context and the main characteristics of the methodology implied by Bene Banca in managing cyber risk. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews of an open-ended nature and questionnaires to directors, members of the audit committee, risk managers, compliance managers, internal audit function and anti-money laundering responsible. We decided to concentrate on this small bank because of its size and its role on the local territory and because the cyber risk management is outsourced. Furthermore we focus on the topic of cyber crime because IT attacks have increased drastically in recent years, both in terms of complexity and resources, and they cannot be stopped by single organizations, because they need a response at country level. Consequently this paper has been motivated by the gaps in the understanding and in considering cyber risk and cyber risk management as an integral part of the business management.
To further cybersecurity, there is interest in studying online cybercriminal communities to learn more about emerging cyber threats. Literature documents the existence of many online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) cybercriminal communities where cybercriminals congregate and share hacking tools, malware, and more. However, many cybercriminal community participants appear unskilled and have fleeting interests, making it difficult to detect potential long-term or key participants. This is a challenge for researchers and practitioners to quickly identify cybercriminals that may provide credible threat intelligence. Thus, we propose a computational approach to analyze cybercriminals IRC communities in order to identify potential long-term and key participants. We use the extended Cox model to scrutinize cybercriminal IRC participation for better understanding of behaviors exhibited by cybercriminals of importance. Results indicate that key cybercriminals may be quickly identifiable by assessing the scale of their interaction and networks with other participants.
This article analyzes the information and technological advancements made by the BRICS countries in the field of criminal proceedings, specifically in the process of gathering evidence in criminal investigations. The relevance of the research topic is explained by the widespread proliferation of computer-related crimes and other crimes committed using computer technologies. With the increase in cybercrime, the number of digital traces left behind by criminal activity is also increasing. This calls for the development of a new approach for detecting, recording, erasing and investigating these digital traces. Given the transnational and cross-border nature of cybercrime, it is necessary to pursue a policy of interaction among the law enforcement agencies of the BRICS countries in order to effectively provide legal assistance in criminal cases, preserve the electronic data obtained from users of information and telecommunications systems and transfer the data to interested countries upon request. This will aid in the formation of a regulatory framework for the information technology sector that meets modern challenges and requirements. Additionally, it is critical to borrow best practices in order to harmonize the criminal and criminal procedure legislation of the BRICS countries, as coordinated activities will ensure closer cooperation between the countries in the socio-economic and cultural spheres, allowing for the achievement of greater results in these areas. Furthermore, the article demonstrates a new approach to the study of the comparative legal nature of the various legal systems in the BRICS countries. The conclusion reached is that the harmonization of criminal procedure systems essentially comes down to the detection of electronic data, the recording of that data in electronic form, the storage of case materials and the submission of those materials to the court in electronic form. The legal consolidation of these steps will make it possible to introduce electronic document management, thereby enabling the optimization of criminal procedure activities, the objective recording of evidentiary information and the assurance of savings in material and procedural costs associated with criminal proceedings.
Internet of Things (IoT) is a unique element in the realm of Cybersecurity. It constitutes countless applications, including defense, health, agriculture, finance, amongst other industries. The majority of existing studies focus on various developments of IoT products and services essential to our day-to-day activities, with little emphasis on the security of developed systems. This has led to the proliferation of IoT solutions acquired through rapid development and overlooking the need for a structured security framework during the systems' development stages. IoT security capability can be improved by using complementary technologies. This paper explores applying Risk-Based Access Control Model using Blockchain to control access to IoT devices. Although current access control models provide efficient security measures to control who can access the system resources, there is no way to detect and prevent malicious attacks after granting access. The proposed solution utilizes smart contracts under the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) Blockchain Framework to create access permissions and measure the security risks associated with any event in the IoT system and create access permissions to determine what processes may be performed. This will allow the detection of any malicious activity at the early stages of the attack and grant or deny access based on the risk associated with any activity.
Bitcoin has introduced a new concept that could feasibly revolutionise the entire Internet as it exists, and positively impact on many types of industries including, but not limited to, banking, public sector and supply chain. This innovation is grounded on pseudo-anonymity and strives on its innovative decentralised architecture based on the blockchain technology. Blockchain is pushing forward a race of transaction-based applications with trust establishment without the need for a centralised authority, promoting accountability and transparency within the business process. However, a blockchain ledger (e.g., Bitcoin) tend to become very complex and specialised tools, collectively called Blockchain Analytics, are required to allow individuals, law enforcement agencies and service providers to search, explore and visualise it. Over the last years, several analytical tools have been developed with capabilities that allow, e.g., to map relationships, examine flow of transactions and filter crime instances as a way to enhance forensic investigations. This paper discusses the current state of blockchain analytical tools and presents a thematic taxonomy model based on their applications. It also examines open challenges for future development and research.
Ransomware is a recent form of malware that encrypts the files on a target computer until a specific amount (ransom) is paid to the attacker. As a result, in addition to aggressively spreading and disrupting victim's data and operation, differently from most cyberattacks, ransomware implements a revenue model. Specifically, it creates a hostage-like situation in which the victim is threatened with the risk of data loss and forced into a negotiation. In this paper, we use game theory to approach this unique aspect of ransomware, and we present a model for analyzing the strategies behind decisions in dealing with human-controlled attacks. Although the game-theoretical model does not contribute to recovering encrypted files, it can be utilized to understand potential prevention measures, and it can be utilized to further investigate similar types of cybercrime.
"Cybercrime is on the rise. With the ongoing digitization of our society, it is expected that, sooner or later, all organizations have to deal with cyberattacks; hence organizations need to be more cyber resilient. This paper presents a novel framework of cyber resilience, integrating models from resilience engineering and human behavior. Based on a pilot study with nearly 60 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands, this paper shows that the proposed framework holds the promise for better development of human aspects of cyber resilience within organizations. The framework provides organizations with diagnostic capability into how to better prepare for emerging cyber threats, while assuring the viability of human aspects of cyber security critical to their business continuity. Moreover, knowing the sources of behavior that predict cyber resiliency may help in the development of successful behavioral intervention programs."
The current study examines recommendations for addressing organizational members who fall prey to social engineering as a matter of organizational policy through a qualitative analysis of interviews with organizational IT security administrators, IT security auditors, and social engineers. The results of this analysis indicate that participants had an aversion to punitive approaches to security failures. Instead, they tended to favor education as a more pragmatic and humane solution. Others argued that emphasis should be given to rewarding positive security behavior over punishing lapses. Few participants contended that there is a time and place for harsher sanctions but generally only for repeat offenders. Implications for security policy, deterrence theory, and reintegrative shaming theory are considered.
We describe a case-control study to identify risk factors that are associated with higher rates of webserver compromise. We inspect a random sample of around 200 000 webservers and automatically identify attributes hypothesized to affect the susceptibility to compromise, notably content management system (CMS) and webserver type. We then cross-list this information with data on webservers hacked to serve phishing pages or redirect to unlicensed online pharmacies. We find that webservers running WordPress and Joomla are more likely to be hacked than those not running any CMS, and that servers running Apache and Nginx are more likely to be hacked than those running Microsoft IIS. Furthermore, using a series of logistic regressions, we find that a CMS's market share is positively correlated with website compromise. Finally, we examine the link between webservers running outdated software and being compromised. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that servers running outdated versions of WordPress (the most popular CMS platform) are less likely to be hacked than those running more recent versions. We present evidence that this may be explained by the low install base of outdated software.
This chapter will conclude by revisiting the original aims of this book. Namely, to consider the goals of data protection and explore the application and relevance in the cybersecurity context. Although data protection is primarily concerned with the protection of an individual's personal data, a cyber attack or a data security breach can inevitably lead to the loss of data involving an individual's personal information. Whilst cybersecurity continues to be a high priority on the government's agenda, it is perfectly conceivable whether the existing framework (through the Cybercrime Convention and the European EU Electronic Communications framework and the Cybersecurity Directive and Data Protection Regulation) can at least address some of the shortcomings. It will conclude that any proposed change in the Regulator's role to enforce the laws will be a challenging one.
One of the most dangerous aspects that the computer world glimpses are threats to security. It estimated that about 3 billion dollars in cybercrime lost each year. It expected that this figure would double by 2021. In this implementation, the researcher presents the performances of hybrid techniques to identified risks speedily using RFC-RST technique of network intrusion detection system. The main idea is to take the benefit of different models abilities of random forest classifier and rough set theory. Random forest classifier used for attributes selection of datasets and Rough set theory implemented for rules generation. The model experiment did through the Python, Rough set exploration system, and R programming. The aim here is to find the minimum number of rules that could be the representation of knowledge provided by the dataset.
Ransomware is not only the bane of private businesses and publicly-traded companies, it has steadily targeted municipal governmental entities over the past couple of years. Such attacks can cripple a city's ability to provide services and support for its residents. Since these attacks are reported upon in the press, do an attacked community's citizens change their behavior in the wake of the attack? In this study, the security precautions being taken by residents within 20 miles of an attacked community were compared with Internet users living further away from the attacks. Using spatial analysis software like ArcGIS and GWR, we analyzed the data procured from an online survey of American Internet users and found that local learning complements users' prior victimization from cybercrime and their own self-interest to influence their cautious behavior online.
Computer networks have fallen easy prey to cyber attacks in the ever-evolving internet services. Domain Name System (DNS) has also not remained untouched with these cybercrime attempts. Encrypted HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic over Secure Socket Layer (SSL), alternatively called HTTPS, has succeeded to prevent DNS attacks to a great extent. To secure DNS traffic, the security community has introduced the concept of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to improve user privacy and security by combating eavesdropping and DNS data manipulation on the way to prevent Man-inthe-Middle (MitM) attacks. This paper discusses one of the persistent security concerns, abuse of DNS protocol to create covert channels by tunneling data through DNS packets. We identify tunneling activities that utilize DNS communications over HTTPS by presenting a two-layered approach to detect and characterize DoH traffic using time-series classifiers.
Ethereum's high attention, rich business, certain anonymity, and untraceability have attracted a group of attackers. Cybercrime on it has become increasingly rampant, among which scam behavior is convenient, cryptic, antagonistic and resulting in large economic losses. So we consider the scam behavior on Ethereum and investigate it at the node interaction level. Based on the life cycle and risk identification points we found, we propose an automatic detection model named Aparecium. First, a graph generation method which focus on the scam life cycle is adopted to mitigate the sparsity of the scam behaviors. Second, the life cycle patterns are delicate modeled because of the crypticity and antagonism of Ethereum scam behaviors. Conducting experiments in the wild Ethereum datasets, we prove Aparecium is effective which the precision, recall and F1-score achieve at 0.977, 0.957 and 0.967 respectively.
Scams remain among top cybercrime incidents happening around the world. Individuals with high susceptibility to persuasion are considered as risk-takers and prone to be scam victims. Unfortunately, limited number of research is done to investigate the relationship between appeal techniques and individuals' personality thus hindering a proper and effective campaigns that could help to raise awareness against scam. In this study, the impact of fear and rational appeal were examined as well as to identify suitable approach for individuals with high susceptibility to persuasion. To evaluate the approach, pretest and posttest surveys with 3 separate controlled laboratory experiments were conducted. This study found that rational appeal treatment has a significantly stronger impact than the fear appeal. This result is a starting point in suggesting that rational appeal is a promising means in persuading individuals with high susceptibility to persuasion.
"The rapid increase in cybercrime, causing a reported annual economic loss of $600 billion [20], has prompted a critical need for effective cyber defense. Strategic criminals conduct network reconnaissance prior to executing attacks to avoid detection and establish situational awareness via scanning and fingerprinting tools. Cyber deception attempts to foil these reconnaissance efforts; by disguising network and system attributes, among several other techniques. Cyber Deception Games (CDG) is a game-theoretic model for optimizing strategic deception, and can apply to various deception methods. Recently introduced initial model for CDGs assumes zero sum payoffs, implying directly conflicting attacker motives, and perfect defender knowledge on attacker preferences. These unrealistic assumptions are fundamental limitations of the initial zero-sum model, which we address by proposing a general-sum model that can also handle uncertainty in the defender's knowledge."
Malwares attack such as by the worm, virus, trojan horse and botnet have caused lots of troublesome for many organisations and users which lead to the cybercrime. Living in a cyber world, being infected by these malwares becoming more common. Nowadays the malwares attack especially by the trojan horse is becoming more sophisticated and intelligent, makes it is harder to be detected than before. Therefore, in this research paper, a new model called Efficient Trojan Detection Model (ETDMo) is built to detect trojan horse attacks more efficiently. In this model, the static, dynamic and automated analyses were conducted and the machine learning algorithms were applied to optimize the performance. Based on the experiment conducted, the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm has outperformed other machine learning algorithms with 98.2 % of true positive rate and with 1.7 % of false positive rate.
When conducting modern cybercrime investigations, evidence has often to be gathered from computer systems located at cloud-based data centres of hosting providers. In cases where the investigation cannot rely on the cooperation of the hosting provider, or where documentation is not available, investigators can often find the identification of which distinct server among many is of interest difficult and extremely time consuming. To address the problem of identifying these servers, in this paper a new approach to rapidly and reliably identify these cloud hosting computer systems is presented. In the outlined approach, a handheld device composed of an embedded computer combined with a method of undetectable interception of Ethernet based communications is presented. This device is tested and evaluated, and a discussion is provided on its usefulness in identifying of server of interest to an investigation.
Cybercrime becomes a real problem in the everyday operation of production plants, industrial control systems, and other technical devices. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that on-line diagnostics is an effective way to recognize cyberattacks. The security assurance system against cyberattacks for Industrial Control Systems is layered. The article discusses the possibility of the usage of known methods of process diagnostics to recognize cyberattacks in the Industrial Control Systems as an additional protection layer. Cyberattacks manifest with a variety of changes in the operation of the control system and the process flow deviating from its normal state. The discussed concept is to detect such changes based on models, evaluate them and on this basis conclude about the primary reason of abnormal operation, including the detection of cyberattack. Simple examples of such detection system are also presented.
Nowadays, there is an ever-growing need to investigate, consult and communicate through the internet. This need leads to the intensification of free access to the web in strategic and functional points for the benefit of the community. However, this open access is also related to the increase of information insecurity. The existing works on computer security primarily focus on the development of techniques to reduce cyber-attacks. However, these approaches do not address the sector of inexperienced users who have difficulty understanding browser settings. Two methods can solve this problem: first the development of friendly browsers with intuitive setups for new users and on the other hand, by implementing awareness programs on essential security without deepening on technical information. This article addresses an analysis of the vulnerabilities of wireless equipment that provides internet service in the open access zones and the potential risks that could be found when using these means.
With the development of new technologies, cyber security risks have become a matter of great concern among hospitality managers. This work studies the relationship between hospitality workers' awareness and training about the risks of cybercrime on one hand, and the number of cyberattacks suffered by firms on the other. Using representative data for EU-27 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in 2021, we show that hospitality firms whose workers are not properly aware of cyber risks are victim of more security breaches. However, current formal training practices are not being successful at decreasing the attacks suffered. Moreover, cybercrimes are positively associated with the use of personal devices and firms' degree of digitalization. Our findings have important implications for hospitality management, suggesting that (i) better ICT training is needed to decrease the likelihood of suffering cyberattacks, and (ii) the use of personal devices at work is a commonly neglected risk factor.
In recent months, the demand for services provided on the Internet (scientific conferences, training, webinars) has increased. As this activity grew, so did cybercrime. Social networks share invitations to various training and webinars. We also receive similar announcements via e-mail. It is not difficult to accidentally click on the attached link. The submitted URL may contain a script. The script may infect our device or steal our login details. We have developed a new security protocol - Amelia, to protect against responding to a false invitation to a web event. Our protocol makes it possible to check if the link sent is valid. Also, it enables the generation of unique user identifiers. Amelia protocol provides users' verification and distribution of symmetric session keys. We conducted a study of our protocol. We checked its vulnerability to Intruder attacks. The obtained results are promising. We did not find an attack on this protocol.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the impact of criminal policy on cyberbullying in Indonesia. Cyberbullying is indeed a contemporary issue, as the advancement of technology has increased the number of instances of cyberbullying that are detrimental to society. Methods: The method of this study was qualitative because it was based on the interview protocols that were taken with careful consideration to analyse to what extent criminal policy in Indonesia affects cyberbullying in Indonesia. The target population for the interviews was the criminal justice system and cybercrime department. Results: The study demonstrates that the criminal policy alone is ineffective in preventing cyberbullying, but it is also society's social and moral responsibility to fight against this crime. Conclusion: This study provides significant theoretical and practical implications that are important to consider eliminating the social and moral crime of cyberbullying that is disturbing children socially and psychologically.
Ransomware is a new business model for cybercrime which mainly targets individual users and machines. Many events have shown how profitable the technique can be. Industrial control systems (ICS) are becoming the next domain. More and more researchers and attackers have become the focus on this field and presented some ICS ransomware. But existing ICS ransomware is theoretically feasible and has a limited effect on real ICS. In this work, we present ICS-BROCK, a full-fledged ICS ransomware that can compromise a real-world. To demonstrate the capability of ICS-BROCK, we use SIEMENS S7-300 PLC, one of the most widely used devices in ICSs, to build a real water treatment environment. The results empirically demonstrate the feasibility of launching ICS ransomware attacks in a practical setting. In the end, we give some suggestions on ICS ransomware to aid in future study and defenses.
"Ransomware became the face of cybercrime in 2017 when waves of attacks breached business information systems, locking critical information. At first it appeared the perfect crime where whole organizations had lost access to their vital information and the only way out was to pay the attackers in Bitcoin for the key to the lock. However, the Ransomware business model requires the formation of a trust relationship between the attacker and the victim; and the potential for the formation and maintenance of a trust relationship became rapidly eroded by identifiable points of failure. In order to better understand the phenomena we spent 12 months of emersion in an exploratory study observing the business processes and technologies associated with Ransomware. We conclude that negative risk is still apparent for unprepared organizations, but within a period of time the erosion of trust will render the Ransomware crime uneconomical and the model ineffective."
In this article, the authors lay the foundation for the emerging area of research on online protest tactics mobilized against business. The authors offer a definition of online business protest tactics and distinguish them from related activities such as electronic civil disobedience and cybercrime. They also appeal to the interest-group literature as one theoretical foundation for this area of research. Based on the degree to which each tactic involves intrusion, disruption, or damage, the authors categorize the array of online business protest tactics into a typology, providing definitions and illustrative examples from the business press for each. They advance a dualistic framework to evaluate the intermediate and ultimate effectiveness of the various online business protest tactics using a set of criteria relevant to both online and off-line environments, and conclude by suggesting avenues for future research.
Pirates on the virtual sea are supplying their illicit digital content and goods through cyberlockers and darknet markets. The deep web hosts darknet marketplaces selling a variety of wares, such as narcotics and weapons, and is testimony to the growth of illicit trade on the internet. The challenge of web sites that host digital content piracy is exacerbated through linkages to a variety of nnalware schemes that have created a lucrative crimeware economy. Digital thieves target unsuspecting consumers as digital bait to derive profits from a variety of malware schemes such as ransomware and malvertising. The hijacking of access to computers and their digital content in order to ransom them back to consumers or organizations is considered to be one of the leading threats of internet crime. Malvertising schemes are plaguing the internet advertising business-criminals are reaping profits by posting legitimate advertisements at content theft sites or using an army of botnets to fake advertising traffic. A variety of stratagems are evolving to curb this illicit trade, including fostering multi-lateral enforcement tactics, updating legislation to circumvent this type of crime on the internet, training digital savvy citizens, and creating private-sector remedies.

Cybercrime is on the increase and attacks are becoming ever more sophisticated. Organisations are investing huge sums of money and vast resources in trying to establish effective and timely countermeasures. This is still a game of catch up, where hackers have the upper hand and potential victims are trying to produce secure systems hardened against what feels like are inevitable future attacks. The focus so far has been on technology and not people and the amount of resource allocated to countermeasures and research into cyber security attacks follows the same trend. This paper adds to the growing body of work looking at social engineering attacks and therefore seeks to redress this imbalance to some extent. The objective is to produce a model for social engineering that provides a better understanding of the attack process such that improved and timely countermeasures can be applied and early interventions implemented.
Journal hijacking, which refers to the attempted brand takeover of a journal by a third party, is a nascent threat confronting the information systems (IS) community, as evidenced by cybercriminals having established an online presence, masquerading as the Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems (SJIS). The SJIS hijacking damages the journal's reputation, leads to payment and publication scams, involves identity theft among unsuspecting IS researchers, and results in tarnished author reputations. Beyond SJIS, journal hijacking presents a threat, not only to the IS community, but also to science and academic integrity in general if researchers and readers cannot distinguish between fake publications by hijacked journals and real publications by legitimate journals. In this opinion article, we relate the story of the SJIS hijacking from the victims' perspectives. We describe its many aspects, draw attention to the key factors that contribute to the problem, and offer our perspectives on different response strategies in the absence of simple solutions. We hope to create awareness about the problem and stimulate a discussion in the IS community, not least in the face of digital innovations, such as ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence technologies that may inadvertently support paper mills and the production of fake research results.
AimResearch on deception detection has usually been executed in experimental settings in the laboratory. In contrast, the present research investigates deception detection by actual victims and near victims of fraud, as reported in their own words. Materials and methodsOur study is based on a nationally representative survey of 11 types of (mostly) online fraud victimization (N = 2,864). We used qualitative information from actual victims and near victims on why they didn't fall for the fraud, or how, in hindsight, it could have been prevented. ResultsThe main detection strategies mentioned by near victims (N = 958) were 1) fraud knowledge (69%): these near victims clearly recognized fraud. Other strategies related to fraud knowledge were: noticing mistakes (27.9%), rules and principles about safe conduct (11.7%), and personal knowledge (7.1%). A second type of strategy was distrust (26.1%). A third strategy was 'wise through experience' (1.6%). Finally, a limited number of respondents (7.8%) searched for additional information: they contacted other people (5.5%), sought information online (4%), contacted the fraudster (2.9%), contacted their bank or credit card company (2.2%), or contacted the police (0.2%). Using knowledge as a strategy decreases the probability of victimization by a factor of 0.43. In contrast, all other strategies increased the likelihood of victimization by a factor of 1.6 or more. Strategies generally were uncorrelated, several strategies differed by type of fraud. About 40% of the actual victims (N = 243) believed that their victimization might have been prevented by: 1) seeking information (25.2%), 2) paying more attention (18.9%), 3) a third party doing something (16.2%), 4) following safety rules or principles, like using a safer way of paying or trading (14.4%), or by 5) 'simply not going along with it' (10.8%). Most of these strategies were associated with a higher, not lower, likelihood of victimization. ConclusionClearly, knowledge of fraud is the best strategy to avoid fraud victimization. Therefore, a more proactive approach is needed to inform the public about fraud and attackers' modus operandi, so that potential victims already have knowledge of fraud upon encountering it. Just providing information online will not suffice to protect online users.
Underground forums allow users to interact with communities focused on illicit activities. They serve as an entry point for actors interested in deviant and criminal topics. Due to the pseudo-anonymity provided, they have become improvised marketplaces for trading illegal products and services, including those used to conduct cyberattacks. Thus, these forums are an important data source for threat intelligence analysts and law enforcement. The use of multiple accounts is forbidden in most forums since these are mostly used for malicious purposes. Still, this is a common practice. Being able to identify an actor or gang behind multiple accounts allows for proper attribution in online investigations, and also to design intervention mechanisms for illegal activities. Existing solutions for multi-account detection either require ground truth data to conduct supervised classification or use manual approaches. In this work, we propose a methodology for the large-scale identification of related accounts in underground forums. These accounts are similar according to the distinctive content posted, and thus are likely to belong to the same actor or group. The methodology applies to various domains and leverages distinctive artefacts and personal information left online by the users. We provide experimental results on a large dataset comprising more than 1.1M user accounts from 15 different forums. We show how this methodology, combined with existing approaches commonly used in social media forensics, can assist with and improve online investigations. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

There are several challenges facing criminal justice stakeholders with the emergence of this form of criminality, aptly termed nonconsensual pornography. The current study will examine the management and experiences of a newer form of cybercrime, non consensual pornography, by an imperative category of criminal justice stakeholders: county and district prosecutor offices in the United States. With data collected from electronic surveys, this exploratory study will investigate the frequency these offices are experiencing nonconsensual pornography cases, and any significant factors that affect the sanctions administered by the court system. Results indicated prosecutor offices experienced revenge pornography crimes more so than any other form of nonconsensual pornography. In addition, the results from both quantitative models indicated more years of practice of law in a current state increased the likelihood of revenge pornography cases prosecuted receiving a sanction of incarceration and/or fine.
Botnets are becoming the predominant threat on the Internet today and is the primary vector for carrying out attacks against organizations and individuals. Botnets have been used in a variety of cybercrime, from click-fraud to DDOS attacks to the generation of spam. In this paper we propose an approach to detect botnet activity by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning classification techniques. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals and we examine the performance of two popular classification techniques with respect to this data. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of botnet activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows, though there are some limitations to the approach based on the selection of attributes.
The skills of forensic analysts are at risk to process the increasing data in the Internet of Things-based environment platforms. However, the technical issues like anti-forensics, variety of traffic formats, steganography or encrypted data, and real-time live investigation degrades the performance of the cyber forensic framework. Therefore, an effective method named Sunflower Jaya Optimization-based Deep stacked autoencoder (SFJO-based Deep stacked autoencoder) is proposed to perform the cyber forensic framework. The finite element model of Sunflower optimization is integrated with the control parameters of Jaya optimization to solve the issues in the cyber forensic framework. The proposed SFJO-based Deep stacked autoencoder uses the pollination and the peculiar behaviors to enable the cyber forensic framework based on the error value in the big data analytics model. Accordingly, the solution with the minimal value of error is accepted as the best optimal solution by computing the orientation vector. However, the proposed model is illustrated based on the unconstrained benchmark function, which in turn results in the fitness function to reveal the best candidate solution. The proposed SFJO-based Deep stacked autoencoder attained better performance using metrics like precision, sensitivity, and specificity with the values of 0.9053, 0.8865, and 0.8839 using dataset-1.
Increasing numbers of people fall victim to blackmail on social media. Yet, there has been little attempt to synthesise research on this topic. This study seeks to address this gap by investigating what is currently known about blackmail and the disclosure of sensitive information on social media. Two rapid reviews were conducted and based on their findings those who disclose more information, are younger, female and willing to use social media to create and distribute images are more likely to fall victim to blackmail on social media. However, worry about privacy and the possibility of becoming a victim of blackmail on social media did not necessarily prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. The implications of these findings for interventions and future research are discussed.
Searching and seizing voluminous data is a challenge that Indonesian law enforcement authorities should resolve. Indonesia does not have a comprehensive regime on personal data protection. The absence of a coherent legal framework on personal data protection does not negate the obligation of Indonesian law enforcement authorities to protect personal data of Indonesian subjects. However, the absence of the framework may lead to uncertainties or ambiguities on how the authorities should protect personal data. Against the uncertainties and ambiguities, Indonesian law enforcement authorities should resolve issues of voluminous data in obtaining e-information with the prevailing legislation. This article attempts to answer the question: how may Indonesian law enforcement authorities interpret the current law to establish a coherent legal framework to protect personal data in searching or seizing voluminous data? The interpretation is instrumental in supporting the development of the Indonesian regime on personal data protection. It proposes that the Indonesian criminal procedure law should emphasise the active role of the chief judges of competent district courts and should incorporate particularity and proportionality as conditions and safeguards in the execution of search and seizure.
Monitoring security properties of cyber systems at runtime is necessary if the preservation of such properties cannot be guaranteed by formal analysis of their specification. It is also necessary if the runtime interactions between their components that are distributed over different types of local and wide area networks cannot be fully analyzed before putting the systems in operation. The effectiveness of runtime monitoring depends on the trustworthiness of the runtime system events, which are analyzed by the monitor. In this paper, we describe an approach for assessing the trustworthiness of such events. Our approach is based on the generation of possible explanations of runtime events based on a diagnostic model of the system under surveillance using abductive reasoning, and the confirmation of the validity of such explanations and the runtime events using belief based reasoning. The assessment process that we have developed based on this approach has been implemented as part of the EVEREST runtime monitoring framework and has been evaluated in a series of simulations that are discussed in the paper.

Making the sale, possession and distribution of the tools of hacking a criminal offence has obvious attractions. But many such tools are dual use and new laws run the risk of significantly inhibiting the activities of investigators, incident responders, penetration testers and academics. Recent UK attempts at framing such a law are discussed in order to show the broader problems of policy and wording. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
The rapid development of cross-border e-commerce over the past decade has accelerated the integration of the global economy. At the same time, cross-border e-commerce has increased the prevalence of cybercrime, and the future success of e-commerce depends on enhanced online privacy and security. However, investigating security incidents is time- and cost-intensive as identifying telltale anomalies and the source of attacks requires the use of multiple forensic tools and technologies and security domain knowledge. Prompt responses to cyber-attacks are important to reduce damage and loss and to improve the security of cross-border e-commerce. This article proposes a digital forensic model for first incident responders to identify suspicious system behaviors. A prototype system is developed and evaluated by incident response handlers. The model and system are proven to help reduce time and effort in investigating cyberattacks. The proposed model is expected to enhance security incident handling efficiency for cross-border e-commerce.
Existing antivirus products employ diverse types of techniques to detect malware or any suspicious activities. The majority of such techniques rely on signature-based detection algorithms. However, the speed of such detection algorithms may adversely impact the performance of the antivirus products (e.g., if used for online virus scanning). In this paper, we review existing research that proposed fast and efficient signature-based algorithms to dynamically improve the time and accuracy of virus detection. We classify and discuss the different algorithms according to the type of analysis they perform (i.e., static, dynamic or hybrid). In addition, we evaluate existing virus detection algorithms using different design issues and performance criteria, namely (a) memory cost, (b) time complexity, and (c) detection rates. In addition, we discuss how certain design choices of signature-based approaches can only apply to specific virus detection circumstances. Finally, we present the current research challenges of using signature-based algorithms for investigating cybercrime activities.
With the increasing popularity of cloud services and their potential to either be the target or the tool in a cybercrime activity, organizational cloud services users need to ensure that they are able to collect evidential data should they be involved in litigation or a criminal investigation. In this paper, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the technical issues and processes regarding collection of evidential data in the cloud computing environment. Using VMware vCloud as a case study in this paper, we describe the various artefacts available in the cloud environment and identify several forensic preservation considerations for forensics practitioners. We then propose a six-step process for the remote programmatic collection of evidential data to ensure as few changes as possible are made as part of evidence collection and that no potential evidence is missed. The six-step process is implemented in a proof of concept application to demonstrate utility of the process.
The Shadow Brokers (TSB) are an infamous group of hackers responsible for major cybercrime incidents. There are currently few studies on TSB, and to prevent their attacks in the future, we believe it is necessary to study them beforehand. This study constructs a relation graph of all the entities concerning TSB using identifiers in the Web. We introduce a systematic approach to finding relations among entities using a case study based on identifiers and clearness of relations. Our investigation covers data from both the Surface Web and Dark Web, with our Dark Web data consisting of over 40 million Dark Web webpages. We have uncovered many hacking forums, hacking groups, and individuals having a relation with TSB using our method. The relation graph of TSB will become a stepping stone in developing a knowledge base of TSB.
The study investigates the influence of information and Communication Technology on behavior problems of Nigerian youths. A self administered survey was conducted with 550 convenience samples of university undergraduates in three universities in Benue State, Nigeria. Four research questions and four hypotheses guided the study. Descriptive statistics, mean, standard deviation and multiple regression statistics were used to analyze the data. The empirical results indicate that there is a joint significant influence of ICT, school, sex and age on cybercrime, aggressive behavior, truancy and sex crimes among youths. However while ICT remained constant and significant, none of the other variables contributed significantly independently. The study recommends that guidance counselors and clinical psychologists at both post primary and tertiary institutions should use appropriate skills and techniques to assist in curbing the identified behavior problems.

Cyberspace used by all the institutions and structures of the EU and EC (developing networks of common use and specialized networks), with a wide access for individual customers. All of this is governed by relatively few regulations. However, given that Community law (acquis communautaire) is a hierarchically organized system of rules, it should initially be assumed that regulations on cyberspace would become a part of this system, i.e. subsystem. The common interest requires that the network users know those regulations and that measures for the elimination of cybercrime have been taken. The purpose of this article is to analyze the laws in terms of their legitimacy with the intent of the legislature and the public needs for cyber bullying in Poland and the EU law.

Air pollution has a severe impact on human physical and mental health. When the air quality is poor enough to cause respiratory irritation, people tend to stay home and avoid any outdoor activities. In addition, air pollution may cause mental health problems (depression and anxiety) which were associated with high crime risk. Therefore, in this study, it is hypothesized that increasing air pollution level is associated with higher indoor crime rates, but negatively associated with outdoor crime rates because it restricts people's daily outdoor activities. Three types of crimes were used for this analysis: robbery (outdoor crime), domestic violence (indoor crime), and fraud (cybercrime). The results revealed that the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model performed best with lower AIC values. In general, in the higher population areas with more severe air pollution, local authorities should allocate more resources, extra police officers, or more training programs to help them prevent domestic violence, rather than focusing on robbery.
Nowadays, banking, mobile phone communications, transportation, and other daily services are closely intertwined with the Internet. However, although online services make our lives more convenient and manageable, criminals have found ways of accessing users via the Internet to steal sensitive information such as passwords and bank details. This can cost Internet users dearly. Elderly users are the main target for online criminals, due to their relative lack of knowledge about the Internet and its risks. Therefore, they often become victims of various types of cybercrime. This paper studies the effects of security awareness on elderly users and their ability to detect phishing attacks in social media. With this approach, a real experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of security awareness on WhatsApp application users in their daily communications. The results of the experiment revealed that phishing awareness training has a significant positive effect on the ability of elderly users to identify phishing messages, thereby avoiding attacks.
Cybercrime is costly both for businesses and consumers. Criminals can have different purposes, such as financial winnings, defacement and disruption, which not only cause financial loss but also damage organization's reputation and image. To prevent a number of cybercrimes and simple mistakes, such as not insuring that all traffic into and out of a network pass through firewall, security of e-commerce systems should be considered from the very beginning, i.e. early stage of the e-commerce software development. This is due to software vulnerabilities are a huge security problem. Therefore, to enhance security of e-commerce software, we propose the use of multi-agent system. The research in this paper is focused mainly on the design of agents that provide support to engineers during development process. Moreover, the multi-agent system, presented in this research, supports implementation of patterns and extraction of security information, and provides traceability of security requirements in the engineering process.
Computer security is a matter of great interest. In the last decade there have been numerous cases of cybercrime based on the exploitation of software vulnerabilities. This fact has generated a great social concern and a greater importance of computer security as a discipline. In this work, the most important vulnerabilities of recent years are identified, classified, and categorized individually. A measure of the impact of each vulnerability is used to carry out this classification, considering the number of products affected by each vulnerability, as well as its severity. In addition, the categories of vulnerabilities that have the greatest presence are identified. Based on the results obtained in this study, we can understand the consequences of the most common vulnerabilities, which software products are affected, how to counteract these vulnerabilities, and what their current trend is.
In this modern, technological age, the internet has been adopted by the masses. And with it, the danger of malicious attacks by cybercriminals have increased. These attacks are done via Malware, and have resulted in billions of dollars of financial damage. This makes the prevention of malicious attacks an essential part of the battle against cybercrime. In this paper, we are applying machine learning algorithms to predict the malware infection rates of computers based on its features. We are using supervised machine learning algorithms and gradient boosting algorithms. We have collected a publicly available dataset, which was divided into two parts, one being the training set, and the other will be the testing set. After conducting four different experiments using the aforementioned algorithms, it has been discovered that LightGBM is the best model with an AUC Score of 0.73926.
Hackerspaces are physical community spaces where technology enthusiasts meet. Despite the term 'hacking' being widely associated with cybercrime, hackerspaces are not only perfectly legal but resourceful, skilled communities: members cultivate digital expertise and technological craftsmanship in experiential learning practices. While the educational value of hackerspaces has been rightfully acknowledged, not everyone equally benefits from potential learning opportunities. Many hackerspaces struggle with issues related to communal homogeneity, being frequently dominated by white, male members. Underrepresented groups, notably women, non-binary, genderqueer, and transgender members, have experienced discrimination and harassment. In response, explicitly feminist hackerspaces emerged. How are learning approaches and involved technology different in such feminist hacking communities? More specifically, how do feminist hackerspaces choose, discuss, and shape technology in their learning practices and educational approaches? Methodologically drawing on a single case study approach, the paper argues that hackerspaces have the potential to act as intersectional, technofeminist sites for experiential learning.
This paper is devoted to a new sphere of the Russian humanitarian knowledge and practice of ensuring the media security of children on social networks, which can be considered as the prior channel of mass media, especially for this demographic category of teens. The researchers consider that media security is the state of protection of the essential interests of the individual against threats coming from mass media systems. There exists the law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development in Russia, but most of its requirements do not apply to social networks because their legal status as the mass media in Russia remains undetermined. While the level of cybercrime in social networks is extremely high, Russian schools ignore this problem. At the end the researchers gives basic recommendations to teachers on how they can help pupils be safe in the social networks.
Technology is rapidly evolving in a world driven by social networks, online transactions, cloud computing, and automated processes. But with the technological evolution comes the progress of cybercrime, which continually develops new attack types, tools and techniques that allow attackers to penetrate more complex or well-controlled environments, and produce increased damage and even remain untraceable. The present article aims to get an overview of the cyber-crime as it is defined and revealed by specialized literature, international legislation and historical facts, and perform an analysis of attacks reported all around the world over the last three years in order to determine patterns and trends in cyber-crime. Based on the results of the analysis, the article presents countermeasures that companies may undertake in order to ensure improved security that would support in defending their business from attackers from an information security perspective.

Analyzing authorship of online texts is an important analysis task in security-related areas such as cybercrime investigation and counter-terrorism, and in any field of endeavor in which authorship may be uncertain or obfuscated. This paper presents an automated approach for authorship analysis using machine learning methods, a robust stylometric feature set, and a series of visualizations designed to facilitate analysis at the feature, author, and message levels. A testbed consisting of 506,554 forum messages, in English and Arabic, from 14,901 authors was first constructed. A prototype portal system was then developed to support feasibility analysis of the approach. A preliminary evaluation to assess the efficacy of the text visualizations was conducted. The evaluation showed that task performance with the visualization functions was more accurate and more efficient than task performance without the visualizations.
Retrieving reports of cybercrimes against women in two daily newspapers, the Times of India and the Hindu in the years 2014-2016 and taking a ratio of the same against the total number of cybercrimes in the same period reported by the National Crime Records Bureau, we have developed a simple media sensitivity index of cybercrimes against women. Considering the paucity of similar studies, this may reveal a new area of research which might also help to develop a more apt media sensitivity index, applicable to a range of crimes. Further, it may help to identify the thrust of media reports towards particular types of crimes as well as facilitate the measurement of media sensitivity to different crime genres.
We describe a case-control study to identify risk factors that are associated with higher rates of webserver compromise. We inspect a random sample of around 200,000 webservers and automatically identify attributes hypothesized to affect the susceptibility to compromise, notably content management system (CMS) and webserver type. We then cross-list this information with data on webservers hacked to serve phishing pages or redirect to unlicensed online pharmacies. We find that webservers running WordPress and Joomla are more likely to be hacked than those not running any CMS, and that servers running Apache and Nginx are more likely to be hacked than those running Microsoft IIS. We also identify several WordPress plugins and Joomla extensions that associated with compromise. Furthermore, using a series of logistic regressions, we find that a CMS's market share is positively correlated with website compromise. Surprisingly, we find that webservers running outdated software are less likely to be compromised than those running up-to date software. We present evidence that this is true for core WordPress software (the most popular CMS platform) and many associated plugins. Finally, we examine what happens to webservers following compromise. We find that under 5 percent of hacked WordPress websites are subsequently updated, but those that do are recompromised about half as often as those that do not update.
The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings countless benefits, but it also brings new security and forensics challenges. The IoT system with billions of devices generates a huge amount of evidence which causes big challenges to digital investigators and practitioners who are required to interact with IoT devices to investigate cybercrimes in a forensically sound and timely fashion. These challenges create more opportunities for cybercrimes to attack various IoT application and services resulting in a direct impact on IoT users. As the IoT has incorporated in most aspects of our life, cybercrimes will literally threaten human life, hence, IoT forensics is required to investigate and mitigate against such attacks. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed review of IoT forensics. It started by providing a comprehensive discussion of IoT security involving the need for security by design and security challenges of the IoT system. Then, a review of IoT forensics is presented by highlighting the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT forensics, state-of-theart research and recent studies, opportunities and key requirements for a successful IoT forensics. Challenges and suggested solutions of IoT forensics are also discussed. Finally, a discussion of open research directions of IoT forensics is presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Two recent studies which are part of the Dutch Research Program on the Safety and Security of Online Banking, present empirical material regarding the origin, growth and criminal capabilities of cybercriminal networks carrying out attacks on customers of financial institutions. This article extrapolates upon the analysis of Dutch cases and complements the existing picture by providing insight into 22 cybercriminal networks active in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The analysis regarding origin and growth shows that social ties play an important role in the majority of networks. These networks usually originate and grow either by means of social contacts alone or by the combined use of social contacts and forums (to recruit specialists). Equally, however, forums play a vital role within the majority of the networks by offering a place where co-offenders can meet, recruit and trade criminal 'services'. Moreover, those networks where origin and growth is primarily based on forums appear capable of creating more flexible forms of cooperation between key members and enablers, thereby facilitating a limited number of core members to become international players. Analysis of the capabilities of criminal networks shows that all networks are primarily targeted towards customers of financial institutions, but most networks are not restricted to one type of crime. Core members are often involved in other forms of offline and online crime. The majority of networks fall into the high-tech category of networks, mostly international, high-tech networks. These are networks with core members, enablers, and victims originating from different countries.
"We study users' incentives to become cybercriminals when network security is interdependent. We present a game-theoretic model in which each player (i.e., network user) decides his type, honest or malicious. Honest users represent law-abiding network users, while malicious users represent cybercriminals. After deciding on their types, the users make their security choices. We will follow [29], where breach probabilities for large-scale networks are obtained from a standard interdependent security (IDS) setup. In large-scale IDS networks, the breach probability of each player becomes a function of two variables: the player's own security action and network security, which is an aggregate characteristic of the network; network security is computed from the security actions of the individual nodes that comprise the network. This allows us to quantify user security choices in networks with IDS even when users have only very limited, aggregate information about security choices of other users of the network."
The scope of digital criminal investigations is rapidly expanding, as they have become indispensable in prosecuting not only cybercrime but all kinds of crimes involving digital evidence. Digital investigations often involve a high degree of intrusiveness, granting law enforcement authorities large-scale access to personal data, programs, and systems. As a result, it is essential to critically assess the legitimacy of digital investigations to prevent potential abuses. When balancing the social need for crime control with the protection of citizens' rights and interests, we find, on one side of the scale, the public interest of countering and preventing serious crime in a digital world. But which parameters must be incorporated on the other side of the scale? While most attention is given to privacy and data protection in European law to regulate the collection and processing of personal data by law enforcement in criminal proceedings, we propose that another increasingly vital interest needs to be factored in as well: the protection of cybersecurity.
Dark web is an obscured part of the Internet, specifically used for sharing exploits, data breaches, and other means of cybercrime. Dark web forums provide opportunities to share such data and exploits and assign user reputation and credibility through participation in discussions and sharing data, exploits, and hacks. Such activities can help develop metrics to enable iden-tification of influential mal-actors facilitating efficient and effective defense against emerging cyber threats, particularly zero-day exploits. This paper proposes an AI-inspired framework to identify influencers on dark web social networks (INSPECT) through intelligent analysis of user-profiles, interactions, and other activities. INSPECT framework leverages Feature Engineering, Social Network Analysis, Semantic Analysis, and K-means clustering and calculates an influencer score representing the users' significance within these forums. INSPECT has been evaluated using CrimeBB dataset comprising user profiles and activities within dark web forums to assess its effectiveness in identifying influential users on the dark web forums.
With advances in social engineering tricks and other technical shortcomings, ransomware attacks have become a severe cybercrime affecting organizations of all shapes and sizes. Although the security teams are making plenty of ransomware detection tools, the ransomware incident report shows they are ineffective in detecting emerging ransomware attacks. This work presents RTrap,  a systematic framework to detect and contain ransomware efficiently and effectively via machine learning-generated deceptive files. Using a data-driven decoy file selection and generation strategy, RTrap plants deceptive decoy files across the directory to lure the ransomware to access it. RTrap also introduced a lightweight decoy watcher to monitor generated decoy files in real time. As the timing of the ransomware attack is not known to the victim in advance, and the ransomware encryption process is speedy, the proposed decoy-watcher executes an automatic/automated response after the detection promptly. The experiment shows that RTrap can detect ransomware with an average 18 file loss per 10311 legitimate user files.
As fraud and cybercrime become more frequent and sophisticated, preventing users from being exposed to risk is a significant challenge for the scientific community. Current banking systems use One Time Password (OTP) sent to the mobile phone to prevent user impersonation attacks. However, it could be compromised by man-in-the-middle attacks. It also presents usability and unavailability problems if the SMS service is inaccessible, especially when traveling or in case of a damaged or stolen phone. Using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and prevent fraudulent actions allows financial organizations to stay one step ahead of fraudsters, whose scale and sophistication continue to grow. Specifically, ML systems can be used to identify additional authentication factors to make the system more robust against attacks. To prevent identity theft attacks and minimize fraudulent transactions, we propose in this work a comprehensive design that combines adaptive multi-factor authentication and adaptive fraud detection for banking systems based on the use of ML technology.
Escape rooms are a great way for teams to work together to practice quickly solving problems under pressure and time constraints - all while simultaneously having fun. This article is about an online escape room designed to require cooperation and conflict, rational choice, decision making, truth-functional logic, causality, hypothesis testing, problem solving, cognitive and metacognitive challenges, teamworking and interpersonal communication under time pressure and stress, and organizing a strategic response that can later translate to the efficient and effective facilitation of real-world actions - all within a totally digitalized environment called e-REAL (R). Cognitive biases, fixation errors, and other obstacles to overcome are assured, but evitable thanks to the effective learning experience are also assured. This escape room is designed to present lively, interactive activities aimed at understanding challenging scenarios like decision-making chains, as well as thrillers or cybercrime scenarios, Blockchain-based operations or digital and cryptocurrencies, but also data visualization and interpretation, preventative maintenance operations, and crisis management in healthcare or telemedicine.
"Automatic international has delivered efficiencies, new ingenious items, and close customer connections all round with the aid of the a success usage of transportable, IoT (net of factors), on-line life, exam and cloud innovation to create models for higher selections.

Small businesses have many challenges that must be resolved before adoption of e-procurement systems. The present study aims to understand the various financial, technological, educational, organizational, banking, and customers challenges in the adoption of e-procurement system in SME. Based on these challenges, this study has recommended how SME can adopt e-procurement systems. The study followed an interpretivist approach based on qualitative design using 30 non-directive and semi-structured interviews from the various stakeholders of SME. Results reveal the financial, technological, educational, organizational, banking, and suppliers' challenges in the adoption of e-procurement system. Findings emerged with various themes such as limited financial budget and support, high cybercrime rate and lower level of privacy, lack of e-commerce educational programs, and lower level of learning opportunities. Top management must address employee, financial, organizational, and educational challenges before adoption of e-procurement system in SME.
Military enhancements to traditional capabilities include technically capable recruits, high-end intelligence and surveillance technologies, aggressive defence innovation, sophisticated doctrines and dynamic strategies for cyber operations (The Military Balance, 2014). Cyber security has evolved into an important element concerning a states' national security (Pradhan, 2016). According to Hogan LoveIls (2017), South Africa is susceptible due to its high internet connectivity in comparison to its other African counterparts. These cyber-attacks, according to Scott, Bourne and Gabryk (2017), have increased in frequency and resulted in dire consequences and massive data losses. As a legal recourse, the South African government has introduced the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework in December 2015 and the Cybercrime and Cybersecurity Bill in February 2017 in addition to existing ICT legislation. However, there have been a number of criticisms regarding the coverage of the Cybercrime and Cybersecurity Bill with the focus being on organisations and the penalties applicable for violating the Bill. For example, the areas of jus in bello and jus ad bellum has not been sufficiently addressed by the current legislation in South Africa regarding cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manuals are fast becoming the non -binding authoritative manuals applicable to international law regarding cyber operations. The relevant legislative frameworks addressed by the two Tallinn Manuals include the law of state responsibility, maritime law, international telecommunications law, space law, diplomatic and consular law, human rights law, the general principles of international law, including that of sovereignty, jurisdiction, due diligence, as well as the prohibition of intervention. However, there has not been a public assessment or discourse regarding the applicability of the Tallinn Manuals to the South African context. The paper focuses on the applicability of the Tallinn Manuals to South Africa, with specific reference to ICT and cyber law. An overview of South Africa's cyber-security posture and framework within the African and global context will be provided. The ICT and other relevant legislation are assessed for its ability to address South African cyber-security issues, and the suitability of the Tallinn Manuals as a foundation of best practice to enhance the legislation is discussed.
Increased rewards and reduced risks drive illicit networks. Cybercriminals seek to avoid risks, including detection, arrests, sanctions, and violence. Hence, they employ several strategies to avoid operational risks when accessing darknet sites, communicating, making payments, shipping and delivery, and resolving disputes. Each operation involves transactions that should work together, such that when a transaction is disrupted, it increases its risk and reduces the crime's benefits. In this study, we examine these risks, and their avoidance strategies, in an attempt to highlight transactions that could be disrupted. We develop a typology of darknet risks, a parsimonious conceptual model abstracted from the literature on risk originators (internal or external) and risk targets (vendors or buyers). This study further clarifies how risk avoidance strategies may be disrupted to increase the risks and reduce the reward of darknet crime.
Romance fraud involves the guise of a perceived genuine relationship to gain a financial reward. While those who commit these crimes employ a variety of techniques, emerging evidence suggests the use of sextortion to financially gain from victims. To date, sextortion has been explored generally in the image-based sexual abuse and sexual violence literature but not in the context of romance fraud. This article explores reports of 258 individuals who made a complaint to Scamwatch (Australian online fraud reporting portal) about romance fraud, captured between July 2018 and July 2019 (inclusive). Each of these complaints directly references the use of sextortion, through a threat to expose an intimate image or recording in response to a monetary request. Using an established cyber sextortion typology, this article applies these categories in the context of romance fraud to determine if there is consistency in the use of this technique, or whether its use in the context of romance fraud is unique.
A precursor to successful automatic child exploitation material recognition is the ability to automatically identify pornography (largely solved) involving children (largely unsolved). Identifying children's faces in images previously labelled as pornographic can provide a solution. Automatic child face detection plays an important role in online environments by facilitating Law Enforcing Agencies (LEA) to track online child abuse, bullying, sexual assault, but also can be used to detect cybercriminals who are targeting children to groom up them with a view of molestation later. Previous studies have investigated this problem in an attempt to identify only children faces from a pool of adult faces, which aims to extract information from the basic low- and high-level features i.e., colour, texture, skin tone, shape, facial structures etc. on child and adult faces. Typically, this is a machine learning-based architecture that accomplish a categorization task with the aim of identifying a child face, given a set of child and adult faces using classification technique based on extracted features from the training images. In this paper, we present a deep learning methodology, where machine learns the features straight away from the training images without having any information provided by humans to identify children faces. Compared to the results published in a couple of recent work, our proposed approach yields the highest precision and recall, and overall accuracy in recognition.
Social engineering relies on human vulnerability to exploit system security. Social engineering attacks are relatively harder to protect against as they mainly target the user, and not just hardware or software system defenses. End user awareness can be considered as one of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect the end user against social engineering vectors. The present study ascertains the level of user susceptibility to social engineering attacks in a cooperating corporate organization. Two attack scenarios, a spear-phishing campaign and a physical intrusion vector were designed targeting the organization's user population (employees) based on publicly available information from the Internet. Clues relating to social engineering techniques were included in the attacks to alert suspicious users. Despite the revealing signs of a social engineering campaign, the results indicated that a significantly high proportion (46-60%) of the users fell prey and failed to identify the attacks. It was observed that lack of user awareness remained the primary cause of the success of the attacks, requiring corrective action through post incident training and regular IT security drills.
In this paper, we present architecture for managing knowledge on cybersecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa. This architecture captures the critical contextual factors in the Sub-Saharan African region. The architecture enables the creation, storage/retrieval, transfer and application of knowledge on cybersecurity especially for home users while providing awareness and enforcement mechanisms to help home users protect themselves against cyber threats. The architecture can facilitate the building of expertise on cybersecurity among the stakeholders. The implications of the proposed architecture are presented.
This study attempted to confirm the existence of a suppression situation among social learning, low self-control, and software piracy measures. Using a cross-sectional study of middle and high school students, structural equation modeling was used to confirm the measurement of a second-order social learning factor and the existence of a mediated suppression situation of low self-control through social learning on software piracy. The existence of a suppression situation was confirmed when low self-control was modeled with an indirect effect through social learning: The direct effect of low self-control on software piracy flipped direction from positive to negative and social learning's direct effect size increased. This suppression situation was only demonstrated when social learning was modeled as a second-order latent factor. Future research of social learning should consider how its indicators are measured and the importance for the use of all social learning subdomains.
Psychopathy is a personality disorder that can be conceived of as a collection of traits from general models of personality. The present study examined the relations between psychopathy assessed via the Elemental Psychopathy Assessment Short Form (EPA-SF) and basic personality, antisocial behavior, and computer crime in a sample of 235 participants recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Results indicated relatively strong support for the validity of the EPA-SF as it bore expected relations to personality, antisocial behavior, and computer crime. Results also underscored the utility of differentiating among the various components of psychopathy, and revealed the relative importance of Interpersonal Antagonism and Disinhibition and the relative insignificance of emotional stability. Finally, results suggested computer criminal behaviors, like other forms of antisocial behavior, correlated with violent and nonviolent antisocial behavior and psychopathy. Implications for the use of the EPA-SF in the assessment of psychopathy and the utility of considering computer crime as an indicator of general antisocial behavior are discussed.
The study investigates whether nuanced measures of financial loss are associated with physical and/or emotional distress relating to one's identity theft victimization. A subsample of victims of identity theft from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Identity Theft Supplement (n = 1,557) was examined. Financial loss was considered as the total amount lost, whether victims suffered any financial losses, and whether losses were in the 95th percentile. Stepwise negative binomial and logistic regressions were estimated for physical and emotional distress and behavioral health outcomes (i.e., both physical and emotional distress). Findings indicate that out-of-pocket losses were substantively associated with physical and emotional distress as well as behavioral health outcomes only when considering nuanced measures of monetary loss. Time taken to resolve identity theft was associated with increased distress across all outcomes. Nonfinancial consequences of identity theft are fundamentally different phenomena than financial loss and indicate the need for multifaceted responses which acknowledge these outcomes.
Effective operational security is difficult to maintain due to an increase in the costs of work and a decrease in the performance of actions. This is true both for security analysts and malicious attackers. It is tedious, and errors are easy to make. This paper describes the rare discovery of a new Android banking botnet, named Geost, from the operational security failures of its botmaster. They made many mistakes, including using the illegal proxy network of the HtBot malware, not encrypting their Command and Control servers, re-using security services, trusting other attackers with less operational security, and not encrypting chat sessions. The Geost botnet has hundreds of malicious domains, thirteen IP addresses for C&C servers, approximately 800,000 victims in Russia, and potential access to several million Euros in the bank accounts of the victims. More importantly, the operational security mistakes lead to the discovery of members of an underground group that develop and maintain the C&C of Geost. It is seldom possible to glimpse into the decisions taken by the attackers due to failures in their operational security. This research presents the finding of a new Android banking botnet from operational security mistakes, creates an overview of the botnet operation, analyses the victims, and study the relationships with the discovered groups of developers.
While Internet consumers and retailers have incentives to contract to protect against criminal privacy invasions by third parties, externality and observability concerns may limit contractual precaution mandates. Contracting between consumers and retailers operates, however, in the shadow of government efforts to deter cybercrime-which in turn can influence the equilibrium information-sharing activity levels as well as private precaution efforts taken by consumers and retailers. This article argues that there is a criminal analog to the Laffer curve. Just as citizens' reaction to taxation policy raises the possibility that, over some range, lower tax rates may produce higher government revenues, citizens' reaction to penal policies raises the possibility that, over some range, higher penalties may produce more crime. Though victims and thieves may be made better off by a higher crime-higher penalty equilibrium, these private benefits must be measured against (among other things) the social costs of additional state effort.
Phishing is a very effective form of cybercrime that enables offenders to deceive victims and steal important data. Phishing is now one of the most prevalent types of online fraud behaviour. Phishing attacks may cause their victims to suffer significant losses, including the loss of confidential information, identity theft, businesses, and state secrets. We suggest a threat modelling technique in this research to detect and reduce the cyber-threats that might lead to phishing assaults. To uncover all possible dangers that might result in a phishing attack, the proposed study applies the STRIDE threat design methodology to both use scenarios. The studies' findings demonstrate the approach's great effectiveness in identifying phishing URLs, with an accuracy rate of 96.3%, a false-positive rate of 17.2%, and a false-negative rate of 23.7%. Various methods related to phishing and the taxonomy of phishing are analysed.
Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) is a growing, global problem. This article reports on a mixed-methods, multi-jurisdictional study of IBSA across the United Kingdom, Australia and Aotearoa/New Zealand. Attitudes of blame and minimisation of harms among a sample of the general population (n = 6109) were analysed using two multiple regression analyses that assessed the ability of three demographic and three experiential characteristics to predict attitudes. Interviews were also conducted with 43 stakeholders and analysed thematically. Survey respondents who attributed more blame and minimised harms to a greater extent tended to be men, heterosexual, and had experienced or perpetrated more IBSA behaviours. Those who reported greater engagement in sexual self-image behaviours were also more likely to minimise harms. Interview participants suggested attitudes of blame and minimisation may be linked to broader problematic attitudes around sexual violence and sexual double standards, with women more likely to experience blame for IBSA. Our findings are of international relevance and highlight the need for multifaceted policies, education campaigns and training that challenge these attitudes.
Fighting crime in cyberspace requires law enforcement authorities to immerse in a digital ocean of vast amount of information and also to acquire and objectify the evidence of criminal activity. Handling digital evidence is a complex and multifaceted process as they can provide critical evidentiary information in an unquestionable and irrefutable way. When digital evidence resides in a cloud storage environment the criminal investigation is faced with unprecedented contemporary legal challenges. In this paper, the authors identify three main legal challenges that arise from the current cloud-based technological landscape, i.e., territoriality (the loss of location), possession (the cloud content ownership) and confiscation procedure (user authentication/data preservation issues). On the onset of the identified challenges, the existing American, European and International legal frameworks are thoroughly evaluated. Finally, the authors discuss and endorse the Power of Disposal, a newly formed legal notion and a multidisciplinary solution with a global effect as a result of collaboration between technical, organizational and legal perspectives as an effective first step to mitigate the identified legal challenges.
Technological development brings about economic changes that affect most citizens, both in developed and undeveloped countries. The implementation of blockchain technologies that bring cryptocurrencies into the economy and everyday life also induce risks. Authorities are continuously concerned about ensuring balance, which is, among other things, a prudent attitude. Achieving this goal sometimes requires the development of standards and regulations applicable at the national or global level. This paper attempts to dive deeper into the worldwide operations, related to cryptocurrencies, as part of a general phenomenon, and also expose some of the intersections with cybercrime. Without impeding creativity, implementing suggested proposals must comply with the rules in effect and provide sufficient flexibility for adapting and integrating them. Different segments need to align or reposition, as alteration is only allowed in a positive way. Adopting cryptocurrency decisions should be unitary, based on standard policies.
The article discusses the motives and goals of committing crimes against information security. The authors conclude that the motive for crimes against information security is a deliberate motivation, through which the subject has the opportunity to satisfy his own needs via the commission of a crime. If you establish the motive, you can get the answer to the question why the crime was committed. The goal is the result image, which is important for the subject when the crime is committed. If the goal is set, then, accordingly, there is an answer to the question why
Crime has evolved at the same speed technology. Fraud, deception and even rape and murder can be committed using technology. It is necessary that digital evidence considered in court proceedings to resolve many of these cases are considered unsolvable.
The current research aims to gain insight on user competence in detecting security threats in the context of online social networks (OSNs) and investigates the multidimensional space that determines this user competence level. The role of user competence and its dimensions in facilitating the detection of online threats is still a controversial topic in the information security field. The dimensions used to measure the concept are self-efficacy, security awareness, privacy awareness, and cybercrime experience. The scales used to measure those factors can determine the level of user competence in evaluating risks associated with social network usage. The measurement scales employed here have been validated using an item-categorization approach that, to our knowledge, has never before been used in information security research. The result of this study provides evidence for the suitability and validity of the user competence dimensions and associated measurement scales.
The explosive growth of mobile technology has brought uncountable benefits to consumers, but it also presents new concerns and provides a platform for cybercrime. In the case of devices running the Android Operating System (OS), concerns have raised as Android has become a major OS in the market. Moreover, even though there have been efforts from Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), among others, towards reducing the impact of security threats in Android, malicious attacks continue to increase in frequency and complexity. Interestingly, bad software development practices still are being considered a major surface attack provider, mainly due to the lack of knowledge or misuse of Android security features. Therefore, this work presents a Web tool, named GARMDROID, aimed to provide security information that will helps Android developers to identify insecure development aspects, saving them from the nuisances associated to the learning of specialized security analysis tools and techniques.
This study investigated how cybersecurity can be integrated to curb examination breaches among large-scale educational assessment bodies in Nigeria. Descriptive research designed guided the study with 1067 participants drawn through multistage sampling procedure. Cybersecurity and examination breaches on large-scale educational assessment questionnaire (CEBLSEA-Q) was used for data collection. The internal consistency reliability index of the instrument was evaluated to be .78 using Cronbach alpha method. The findings of the study showed that hacking of websites, colluding via social media (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc.), sending of malicious/phishing links, using man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack are some of the cyberattacks on large-scale educational assessments. The proportion of examination breaches experienced by the various examination bodies was significantly different with WAEC being the highest, followed by NECO, JAMB, and NABTEB. Cybersecurity measures such as cloud computing, securing domain name server (DNS), encrypting computers and applications containing assessment database, cybersecurity awareness, among others could curb cyberspace aided examination breaches on educational assessments. Cybersecurity measures should be adopted by large-scale educational agencies in order to curb examination breaches that are aided through the cyberspace.
The rapid expansion of cyberspace has greatly facilitated the strategic shift of traditional crimes to online platforms. This has included malicious actors, such as extremist organisations, making use of online networks to disseminate propaganda and incite violence through radicalising individuals. In this article, we seek to advance current research by exploring how supporters of extremist organisations craft and disseminate their content, and how posts from counter-extremism agencies compare to them. In particular, this study will apply computational techniques to analyse the narratives of various pro-extremist and counter-extremist Twitter accounts, and investigate how the psychological motivation behind the messages compares between pro-ISIS and counter-extremism narratives. Our findings show that pro-extremist accounts often use different strategies to disseminate content (such as the types of hashtags used) when compared to counter-extremist accounts across different types of organisations, including accounts of governments and NGOs. Through this study, we provide unique insights into both extremist and counter-extremist narratives on social media platforms. Furthermore, we define several avenues for discussion regarding the extent to which counter-messaging may be effective at diminishing the online influence of extremist and other criminal organisations.
This paper presents the early results of a study exploring computer misuse and fraud victimisation in Wales, United Kingdom (UK). The results presented here describe the quality of the data available to local forces, the characteristics and heterogeneity of the victims who report incidents and the nature of the police response at a local level. The significance of these results is considered within the enforcement and victimisation policy context that surrounds computer misuse and fraud. It is argued that while Action Fraud data provides a rich source of data with respect to victims' needs, specific improvements in data collection and processing could aid local forces in the delivery (or facilitation) of a more victim-focused response. Alongside this, the results highlight how an adequate police response must take victim heterogeneity into account, both at national and local levels. Finally, better understandings of vulnerability (both theoretically informed and empirically tested) are necessary, on which to build an adequate victim-response to these crime types.
Cyber space is now an essential part of our societies and economies, and may even become a determining factor in our lives. Even though most of business and projects, especially those in transnational environment, are highly dependent on information technology, many of them underestimate the risks of cyberspace and suffer business costs caused by hacker attacks, viruses and malware. Cybercrime is already flourishing in areas with weak cyber governance like in Eastern Europe, and consequently in Romania. International, EU regional and national vigilance and collaborative intelligence are crucial. A global dialogue among governments, society, and the private sector, can help create agreement on how to secure the Internet economy. Romania government should also cooperate in developing an international and regional information exchange and early warning mechanisms in cooperation with our strategic partners, USA and NATO, for rapid reaction in case of crisis, as well as establishing EU Cyberspace Policy Framework.
Network security and network forensics technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT) need special consideration due to resource-constraints. Cybercrimes conducted in IoT focus on network information and energy sources. Graph theory is adopted to analyze the IoT network and a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed. The hybrid IDS consists of Centralized and Active Malicious Node Detection (CAMD) and Distributed and Passive EEA (Energy Exhaustion Attack) Resistance (DPER). CAMD is integrated in the genetic algorithm-based data gathering scheme. CAMD detects malicious nodes manipulated by cyber criminals and provides digital evidence for forensics. DPER is implemented in a set of communication protocols to alleviate the impact of EEA attacks. Simulation experiments conducted on NS-3 platform showed the hybrid IDS proposed detected and traced malicious nodes precisely without compromising energy efficiency. Besides, the impact of EEA attacks conducted by cyber criminals was effectively alleviated.
Online social media (OSM) is an integral part of human life these days. Significantly, the young generation spends most of their time on social media in an active and passive state. The exponential growth of OSM has created an atmosphere of increased cybercrime. Although OSM provides a platform to connect people with similar thoughts and interests, it also exposes vulnerable users to mischievous elements in cyberspace. Social media connects and generates a massive amount of human activity-related data. However, the misuse of OSM introduces a novel way of expressing aggression and violence that exclusively happens online. In this research paper, we briefly discuss the background of Cyberbullying and the various machine and deep learning-based models incorporated to deal with it effectively. We also highlight the main challenges in designing a cyberbullying prediction model and address them.
Communication in the modern day era is predominantly dependent on Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The rise in cybercrime, digital espionage and other cyber-related disturbances i s one of great concerns to cyberspace users, both corporate and individual. Radio Frequency technologies and solutions been adopted for in-building, and outdoor wireless coverage solutions for the supply-chains market, including turnkey solutions for optimized communications, are been faced with security issues. This paper suggests a secure network communications route (Li-Fi Technology) alternative for users of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies and solutions. A communication path that is resilient and resistant to disruptions by mitigating sophisticated network communication attacks such as spoofing and TCP/IP attacks (Man-In-the-middle attacks, Denial of Service attacks). This paper proposes the use of Li-Fi network for a safe and secure cyberspace communication exchange path.
Email is one of the most popular Internet applications which enables individuals and organisations alike to communicate and work effectively. However, email has also been used by criminals as a means to commit cybercrimes such as phishing, spamming, cyberbullying and cyberstalking. Cyberstalking is a relatively new surfacing cybercrime, which recently has been recognised as a serious social and worldwide problem. Combating email-based cyberstalking is a challenging task that involves two crucial steps: a robust method for filtering and detecting cyberstalking emails and documenting evidence for identifying cyberstalkers as a prevention and deterrence measure. In this paper, we discuss a hybrid approach that applies machine learning to detect, filter and file evidence. To this end we present a new robust feature selection approach to select informative features, aiming to improve the performance of machine learning within this task.
In the Japanese healthcare system, demand for homecare for relatively severe diseases has recently been increasing. In providing such homecare, privacy must be maintained with high security because the service is carried out not in hospital but at home, which has insufficient security. It is important to share a common platform to integrate several service providers virtually because there are many types of service providers located in different places involved in the treatment of a single patient. We developed an electronic health record (EHR) system for homecare, which is based on cloud computing technology using smartphones. In this paper, we discuss the technical aspects of information security, which are required especially for homecare based on the results of a field survey. Our focus is on strict personal authentication with SIM cards to prevent the cybercrime of stealing ID in order to maintain strict privacy of patient medical information.
"This paper reports the findings from a research project on cyber security in the Nigerian Internet banking industry, by presenting the main cyber security breaches it has experienced, along with its cyber security capability and practices. An online survey was conducted with 100 experienced professional working in both the Nigerian banking and banking security service sectors. Our findings reveal a transformation of the Nigerian cybercrime industry from low-tech cyber-enabled crimes to high-tech sophisticated breaches, with viruses, worms or Trojan infections; electronic spam mails; and hacking being the top three most experienced breaches. In term of cyber security practices, banking professionals have received adequate management in both support and training. The lack of advanced technologies to prevent and address cyber security breaches and the unsatisfactory level of legislative compliance, together, appear to be the primary factors that have reduced cyber security capability in our sample of banks."
Cloud computing technology offers new way in providing computing resources and applications on demand but it is explicitly prone to the cybercrime. Therefore, it is challenged forensic investigators to conduct investigation in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud using traditional framework. This is exacerbated with the limitations of collecting forensic data from different geographical locations and environment in IaaS Cloud. Thus, in this paper proposes a network forensic framework that can be tailored in forensic analysis in IaaS Cloud Computing environment. The proposed framework is tailored with the existing frameworks with Digital Forensic Model (DFM) in which each phase is elucidated. The proposed framework is then tested and evaluated through experimental using virtualisation environment. The results shows that the proposed framework can be pragmatic implement in IaaS Cloud which contribute in developing of a forensic tool and guidelines for forensic investigator conducting investigation IaaS Cloud as future works.
The article compares risk factors between threat victimization by digital and traditional modes (e.g. email or chat room versus letter or face-to-face). Until now, empirical tests of routine activity theory have applied a segregated approach in such cases, linking computer activities to cybercrime victimization and outdoor activities to traditional victimization. However, an integrated approach suggests that social interactions between people in the physical and digital world are connected. Thus, exposure to conflict-prone situations and eventual escalation of the conflict by a threat can occur in separate domains. Routine activities online can therefore result in traditional threat victimization and, conversely, outdoor activities can result in digital threat victimization. Results from victimization survey data from a sample of the Dutch general population (N = 6896) offer support for these hypotheses. The findings suggest that routine activity theory needs to be tested in new ways in contemporary digitalized societies.
Industry 4.0 integrates cyber systems, physical devices, and digital networks to automate the industrial process. Many sectors aim to adopt the best practices outlined in Industry 4.0. This indicates well for the future networking of an increasing number of devices. As crucial as intelligent automation is, it is essential that it be protected. The proliferation of Internet-enabled gadgets could raise vulnerability to a variety of threats, malware among them. Intruders see a synthesis of factors as a chance to carry out their malicious plan. Keeping sensitive data and information protected from malicious software is a high responsibility for all industries. It is critical to have both a trustworthy approach and a large dataset to work with when constructing a malware traffic classifier. Malware's capacity to elude detection by antivirus programs improves with the day. Because this malware has the potential to compromise the entire network, establishing a malware traffic classifier requires a strong approach. As the number of data increases, the classifier has a harder time distinguishing between benign and malicious network entries. As a result, weighing too many factors is a time-consuming process. To assist with these types of real-world challenges, we construct an effective hybrid selection component, which is subsequently followed by a neural network classifier in this research. The Malware traffic classifier provided here selects the principal feature using filter and wrapper techniques. The feature columns provided by the feature selection program are used to construct a neural network-based binary malware classifier. The given malware traffic classification framework was tested using the MTA-KDD'19 dataset. We set up an experiment in this investigation to examine the way different feature counts perform using a neural-based classifier. The suggested framework achieves 96.8% accuracy while just considering the bare minimum of five features, which is a substantial increase over alternative methods.
The growing world of digitisation has given rise to cybercrimes. Digital forensics is the process of collecting lawful evidence. Such evidence plays a very crucial role in the court of law to demonstrate the fact explicitly against the crime of the suspect. To ensure the admissibility of evidence in the court of law during trials, it is important to maintain evidence using a proper evidence management system. We propose the use of a unidirectional multi-hop proxy re-encryption scheme for authority delegation. This proposed system will help in securely delegating access to digital evidence. The re-encryption scheme perceives a clearer perception of security and validates the usefulness of proxy re-encryption as a method of adding access control to a secure evidence management system. The correctness analysis of the proposed scheme is validated by using BAN logic. The security analysis using the AVISPA tool shows that the proposed scheme is safe against various security attacks.
Personation, the act of assuming another's identity with the intent to deceive, is an ancient phenomenon. In this article, the authors seek to research online impersonation and to uncover the causes of this phenomenon. They do so by analyzing and comparing several case studies while referring to more traditional concepts of social identity. As discovered, on the one hand, users can create fake identities to enhance their personalities for personal reasons such as voyeurism or as means of escaping reality, or even promote human rights by avoiding local authoritarian censorship. On the other hand, malicious users like terrorists or criminals manipulate online users with phishing attempts and frauds, making social cyberspace less secure.
"Purpose Social engineering is a prominent aspect of online crime. Various interventions have been developed to reduce the success of this type of attacks. This paper aims to investigate if interventions can help to decrease the vulnerability to social engineering attacks. If they help, the authors investigate which forms of interventions and specific elements constitute success. Design/methodology/approach The authors selected studies which had an experimental design and rigorously tested at least one intervention that aimed to reduce the vulnerability to social engineering. The studies were primarily identified from querying the Scopus database. The authors identified 19 studies which lead to the identification of 37 effect sizes, based on a total sample of N = 23,146 subjects. The available training, intervention materials and effect sizes were analysed. The authors collected information on the context of the intervention, the characteristics of the intervention and the characteristics of the research methodology. All analyses were performed using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified. Findings The authors find substantial differences in effect size for the different interventions. Some interventions are highly effective; others have no effect at all. Highly intensive interventions are more effective than those that are low on intensity. Furthermore, interventions with a narrow focus are more effective than those with a broad focus. Practical implications The results of this study show differences in effect for different elements of interventions. This allows practitioners to review their awareness campaigns and tailor them to increase their success. Originality/value The authors believe that this is the first study that compares the impact of social engineering interventions systematically."
Cyber security is an investment megatrend: global spending on cyber security increases by 10% every year, three times faster than the global economy. These forecasts can be seen on the upside after the arrival of Covid-19 and the IT tracking systems to monitor the infections that pose privacy and security problems for users. Cyber security is growing more and more and so are venture capital investments in what is the megatrend of the year. The pandemic has contributed to speeding up the digitization process: the consequence is an increasingly uniform distribution of cybercrime throughout the European territory and this reminds us that the lack of a security culture is the vulnerability most exploited by attackers. The Covid-19 pandemic is the cause, albeit indirectly, of this phenomenon. Covid-19 has, in fact, accelerated the digital transformation process and the consequence has been an increase in the criminal phenomenon.
As a topic area, the need for the standardization of operational practices in digital forensics has seen much discussion. There are clear benefits for digital forensics if its procedures can be harmonized including increasing the reliability of the work produced by its practitioners, consistency of practice, and the potential for greater quality control, however, attaining standardization is a difficult task, and further work in this field is required. This work discusses the standardization challenge assessing both the need for standardization and the feasibility of achieving it. It is suggested that those actively contributing in this area should consider the development of models for defining operational practice which are offence-specific, devicespecific and operating system-specific. To support this proposal, an example standard is offered and discussed which suggests and documents the minimum expected requirements for the examination of Windows 10 devices in cases involving images depicting child sexual abuse.

Spam email automated analysis and classification are a challenging task, which is vital in the identification of botnet structures and cybercrime fighting. In this work, we propose an automated methodology and the resulting framework based on innovative categorical divisive clustering, used both for grouping and for classification of spam messages. In particular, the grouping is exploited to identify campaigns of similar spam emails, while the classification is used to label specific emails according to the goal of spammer (e.g., phishing, malware distribution, advertisement, etc.). This work introduces the CCTree algorithm, both as clustering algorithm and as classification algorithm, in two operative modes: batch and dynamic, to handle both large data sets and data streams. Afterward, the CCTree is applied to large sets of spam emails for campaign identification and labeling. The performance of the algorithm is reported for both clustering and classification, and a comparison between the batch and dynamic approaches is presented and discussed.
Intensive development of the communications industry forces operators to pay special attention to fraud control and cybersecurity issues. New technologies allow fraudsters to improve methods of gaining illegal access to transport network infrastructure and it is becoming increasingly difficult for operators to confront this problem. Significant losses from fraud and cybercrime can cause the company to lose part of its revenue and the company can suffer from the decline in investment attractiveness as well as potential brand damage. To avoid this, it is necessary to use specialized technical means that allow timely detection and prevention of illegal actions of attackers. The authors of the article analysed the points of the income loss in providing the IP VPN service within a network of a transport communications operator. A software solution is proposed that performs the tasks of monitoring the correctness of the provision and accounting of access services to a data network using L2VPN/L3VPN technologies or direct connection to an IP/MPLS network.
Real-world laboratory use, controlled internal tests utilizing scientific principles, and peer review should be leveraged in a proper validation test plan of digital and multimedia forensic tools and methods. As the field of digital and multimedia forensics continues to grow and evolve as a science, the importance of proper scientific validation of tools and methods, in addition to the fundamental understanding of its purpose and required elements, will be more critical than ever. As such, this primer article discusses the basic scientific foundations of forensic tool and method validations, in addition to the legal baselines for validations and how they are interpreted in the court of law. Lastly, the recommended steps of a forensically-sound validation methodology are discussed.This article is categorized under:Digital and Multimedia Science > Mobile ForensicsDigital and Multimedia Science > Multimedia ForensicsDigital and Multimedia Science > Cybercrime Investigation
The positive impact of the Internet on human development depends on security and safety of the digital environment. With the share of developing countries in the global Internet population increasing rapidly, addressing the threats posed by malicious cyber activities is a clear priority. The purpose of this article is to explore the linkages between international debates on cyber-related issues (i.e. Internet governance, cybercrime, cybersecurity, or international norms) and cyber capacity building. Specifically, the article analyses capacity building projects by the Council of Europe and International Telecommunication Union to answer if and how they can be used as a tool in foreign policy. This question stems from the assumption that capacity building as a process focused on human resources development, organisational arrangements and legal and institutional frameworks is ultimately aimed at deep societal and political transformation.
The article considers new technologies for cyber terrorism countering. Cyber terrorism is aimed at destabilizing public order, large-scale disruption of communication systems, intimidation by imposing one's will, including on authorities, and, in general, it is an increased threat to the state's national and information security. Particular attention is paid to blockchain technology, which allows hiding funds aimed at financing terrorist activities, including in the information space. The article provides the generalized results of a study in the framework of the implementation of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research scientific project No. 18-29-16175 Blockchain technology to counter the risks of cyber terrorism and cyber extremism: criminological and legal research. To date, there are no internationally normative legal acts that would reflect the problem of cybercrime in general, cyber terrorism and cyber extremism in particular. International legal acts should provide comprehensive and effective measures to counter such crimes, which must be implemented in the national legislation of various states, including international cooperation
The highly crafted lines of code which constitute the Locky cryptolocker ransomware are there to see in plain text in an infected machine. Yet, this forensic evidence does not lead investigators to the identity of the extortionists nor to the destination of the ransom payments. Perpetrators of this ransomware remain unknown and unchallenged and so the ransomware cyber crimewave gathers pace. This paper examines what Locky is, how it works, and the mechanics of this malware to understand how ransom payments are made. The financial impact of Locky is found to be substantial. The paper describes methods for following the money to assess how effectively such a digital forensic trail can assist ransomware investigators. The legal instruments that are being established by the authorities as they attempt to shut down ransomware attacks and secure prosecutions are evaluated. The technical difficulty of following the money coupled with a lack of registration and disclosure legislation mean that investigators of this cybercrime are struggling to secure prosecutions and halt Locky.
The previous year has seen an enormous increase in the studies related to social engineering. This increase is partly due to increasing number of social engineering attacks and partly due to people's inability to identify the attack. Thus, it is of great importance to find solutions which are helpful for human to understand the social engineering attacks and scenarios. To address this, we have performed a literature review of studies (on social engineering) in top-notch journals and conferences. In this paper, we have enlisted the types of attacks, and the persuasion techniques used by social engineers as listed in the literature. We also combined different theories which researchers tried to use to explain various activities of social engineers. Furthermore, we have mentioned that a better understanding of the social engineering attack scenarios can be done using thematic and game-based analysis techniques. Preliminary empirical evaluation of the proposed game based method shows overall neutral results. Future extension and evaluation is needed for the proposed methods.
Cybersecurity education is a crucial element to provide aworkforce for the future to have an awareness together with the skills and knowledge enabling them to adapt and diversify in the field. Cybercrime is covered by the need for distinct aspects of security and measures of control on subsequent systems and devices. As the need for Cybersecurity specialists has increased in recent years and during the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, the provision of education in secondary, post-16 and higher education sectors needs to be met. Utilisation of strategies and innovations to meet industry and educational expectations is key for future provision. Drive for different strategies and innovations in place by governments and organisations throughout the world, as provision in education is not balanced enough to cope with the increasing demand for a cybersecurity workforce. This study will inform recommendations for effective provision of future cybersecurity education.
India is an attractive target for crackers due to high internet and technology penetration growth and limited awareness among the users. It creates moral, civil, and criminal issues in cyber space and it resulted into increase in the cyber crime. But awareness about the cyber law is an often overlooked factor among netizens. Even many stack holders of the computer science are not aware about the cyber law of the country, they are enhancing their technical skills by various means but sadly they are not serious about getting knowledge about cybercrime and cyber law. It necessitated information security awareness among the netizens. In this paper, we have conducted one survey to check cyber law awareness statistics among professionals associated with IT domains. The paper presents the result of a survey conducted and provides the recommendations for improving general awareness of cyber law in India.
Pro-actively finding leaked information online can potentially reduce detection times to limit the exposure time of personal information on publicly accessible networks. Often the breaches are discovered by an external third party and not the data owner. The time that data is exposed on the Internet has severe negative implications since a significant amount of information disclosed in a data breach has been proven to be used for cybercrime activities. It could be argued that any reduction of data breach exposure time should directly reduce the opportunity for associated cyber-crime. While pro-active breach detection has been proven as potentially viable in previous work, several aspects of such a system still need to be investigated. This paper aims to highlight some of the major ethical and legal issues when pro-actively collecting personal information, through a South African case study, to assist in reducing the amounts of personal information being disclosed online.
ChatGPT has garnered significant interest since its release in November 2022 and it has showcased a strong versatility in terms of potential applications across various industries and domains. Defensive cybersecurity is a particular area where ChatGPT has demonstrated considerable potential thanks to its ability to provide customized cybersecurity awareness training and its capability to assess security vulnerabilities and provide concrete recommendations to remediate them. However, the offensive use of ChatGPT (and AI-powered conversational agents, in general) remains an underexplored research topic. This preliminary study aims to shed light on the potential weaponization of ChatGPT to facilitate and initiate cyberattacks. We briefly review the defensive usage of ChatGPT in cybersecurity, then, through practical examples and use-case scenarios, we illustrate the potential misuse of ChatGPT to launch hacking and cybercrime activities. We discuss the practical implications of our study and provide some recommendations for future research.
Social media has dramatically influenced and changed the rate and the nature of crime in our society. The perpetrators cut across different age groups, social standing, and beliefs. The ability to be anonymous on social media and the lack of adequate resources to fight cybercrime are catalysts for the rise in criminal activities, especially in South Africa. We proposed a system that will analyse and detect crime in social media posts or messages. The new system can detect attacks and drug-related crime messages, hate speech, and offensive messages. Natural language processing algorithms were used for text tokenisation, stemming, and lemmatisation. Machine learning models such as support vector machines and random forest classifiers were used to classify texts. Using the support vector machine to detect crime in texts, we achieved 86% accuracy and using the random forest for crime analysis, 72% accuracy was achieved.
The problem of unauthorized access to information on Web sites through the use of malicious code by an attacker leads to undesirable consequences that arise both on the server side and on the users side. This article is devoted to the review and analysis of existing methods for ensuring the information security of automated systems for authentication and distributed networks. The existence of vulnerabilities on most modern Web content management platforms allows an attacker to inject malicious files onto the server or modify existing files. Recently, there has been a large increase in cybercrime, which is a fairly lucrative business for intruders. To avoid the introduction of malicious code on the site, in addition to the above steps, you should use the SCP / SSH / SFTP protocols instead of FTP to download files to the server, which will prevent the passwords from being sent in the clear.
Internet Communication Technologies (ICTs) are making progress day by day, driven by the relentless need to utilize them for everything from leisure to business. This inevitable trend has dramatically changed contemporary digital behavior in all aspects. Undoubtedly, digital fingerprints will be at some point unwarily left on crime scenes creating digital information security incidents. On the other hand, corporates in the private sector or governments are on the edge of being exploited in terms of confidential digital information leakages. Some digital fingerprinting is volatile by its nature. Alternatively, once the power of computing devices is no longer sustainable, these digital traces could disappear forever. Due to the pervasive usage of Google Calendar and Safari browser among network communities, digital fingerprinting could be disclosed if forensics is carried out in a sound manner, which could be admitted in a court of law as probative evidences concerning certain cybercrime incidents.
Concepts of 'cyberspace', 'cybersecurity' and 'cyberthreats' and an analysis of policy documents are employed to explore the character and evolution of cybersecurity policies in Mexico, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, chosen as examples of 'accelerated', 'transitional' and 'lagging' Latin American development. Mexico focused on the stability of the Internet as a space that contributes to faster economic growth. Columbia's 'risk management' path seeks a balance between plausible threat evaluation and the estimated cost of eliminating them and concentrates on the active prevention of cyberattacks, emphasising the importance of developing concrete mechanisms for international regulation in the field of cybersecurity. The approach to cybersecurity of the Dominican Republic is based on the idea of ensuring a rapid transition to an innovative development model with the widespread introduction of information and communication technology (ICT), while addressing domestic cybercrime to which ordinary citizens and businesses are constantly exposed to. Comparing these experiences, it is clear that these approaches are characterised by two trends: randomness and non-imitation.
Recently, cybercrime attacking the national network has increased. National infrastructure such as water purification plants, power plants, and substations are operated by using programmable logic controllers (PLC). PLC controls through the Industrial Control Systems/Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (ICS/SCADA), which receives operational commands and sends operational states by communication means such as Ethernet and Modbus. However, the environment of ICS/SCADA, called Industrial IoT, is vulnerable to security attacks unlike recently developed technologies such as IoT devices, systems, and networks. Therefore, this study proposes a new security system to strengthen industrial firewalls. We developed an interface, unauthorized access blocking algorithm, and real-time defense system for system access control. The performance of the proposed system was verified by external organizations. Five performance indicators were measured to validate the proposed system. All indexes were achieved to 100%. We hope that this study and results will help block and defend against cyberattacks.
Recently, cybercrimes are causing huge impact on different cyber systems that might include vital information such as financial transactions and medical records. A better understanding of the accelerating numbers of cybercrimes and their enormous cost could help the global in bridging the gap between their defenses and the escalating numbers cyber criminals. In this paper, we present an estimation model of cybercrimes time series using auto-regressive (AR) model by employing the optimal modeling order that maximizes the estimation accuracy while maintaining minimum prediction error. The proposed model was developed using Matlab to estimate the time series for yearly global number of cybersecurity incidents activity during the period from 2009-2018 and forecast the figures for next upcoming years 2019-2020. The simulation results showed that the optimal model order to estimate the given cybercrime activity is AR(4) since its corresponds to minimum acceptable predication error values to estimate the signal recording an estimation accuracy of 93.5%.
Breaches of information security resulting from cybercrime represents a significant threat to the security and well-being of individuals, corporations, and governments. Therefore, understanding the neurocognitive processes that lead individuals to violate information security policy represents a fundamental pursuit for NeuroIS researchers. In the current study, we examined the effects of whether an individual or a close associate benefited from a violation of information security, and the temporal delay before the benefit was received on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) related to ethical decision making. The electrophysiological data revealed modulations of the ERPs that were generally sensitive to ethical decision making, or that were specifically sensitive to the recipient or timing of the reward. The components that were sensitive to the two independent variables were observed over the anterior frontal region of the scalp, consistent with the neuroimaging literature demonstrating that several prefrontal structures participate in self-referent processing and intertemporal choice.
A number of reports in the last two years revealed that the BRICS economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) were found to be amongst the largest victims of cybercrime. The recent BRICS summit, held in Xiamen, China, had as one of the main themes of global security, including cybersecurity. Consequently, The BRICS leaders called for a coordinated strategic action in these areas, driven by the requirements and priorities. However, the South African cybersecurity strategic position within the BRICS block appears to be unclear thus far. Hence, this study was aimed at producing a positioning paper that clarifies the South African strategic contribution with a view to leveraging possible benefits from the BRICS cybersecurity cooperation. This research was undertaken through a review and analyses of available documents and publications on the topic. The findings confirm that, despite some challenges, South Africa do strategically contribute to and can potentially benefit from the block's cybersecurity agenda.
Authorship attribution can assist the criminal investigation procedure as well as cybercrime analysis. This task can be viewed as a single-label multi-class text categorization problem. Given that the style of a text can be represented as mere word frequencies selected in a language-independent method, suitable machine learning techniques able to deal with high dimensional feature spaces and sparse data can be directly applied to solve this problem. This paper focuses on classifier ensembles based on feature set subspacing. It is shown that an effective ensemble can be constructed using, exhaustive disjoint subspacing, a simple method producing many poor but diverse base classifiers. The simple model can be enhanced by a variation of the technique of cross-validated committees applied to the feature set. Experiments on two benchmark text corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method improving previously reported results and compare it to support vector machines, an alternative suitable machine learning approach to authorship attribution.
From proactive detection of cyberattacks to the identification of key actors, analyzing contents of the Dark Web plays a significant role in deterring cybercrimes and understanding criminal minds. Researching in the Dark Web proved to be an essential step in fighting cybercrime, whether with a standalone investigation of the Dark Web solely or an integrated one that includes contents from the Surface Web and the Deep Web. In this review, we probe recent studies in the field of analyzing Dark Web content for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), introducing a comprehensive analysis of their techniques, methods, tools, approaches, and results, and discussing their possible limitations. In this review, we demonstrate the significance of studying the contents of different platforms on the Dark Web, leading new researchers through state-of-the-art methodologies. Furthermore, we discuss the technical challenges, ethical considerations, and future directions in the domain.
Electronic healthcare technology is prevalent around the world and creates huge potential to improve clinical outcomes and transform care delivery. However, there are increasing concerns relating to the security of healthcare data and devices. Increased connectivity to existing computer networks has exposed medical devices to new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Healthcare is an attractive target for cybercrime for two fundamental reasons: it is a rich source of valuable data and its defences are weak. Cybersecurity breaches include stealing health information and ransomware attacks on hospitals, and could include attacks on implanted medical devices. Breaches can reduce patient trust, cripple health systems and threaten human life. Ultimately, cybersecurity is critical to patient safety, yet has historically been lax. New legislation and regulations are in place to facilitate change. This requires cybersecurity to become an integral part of patient safety. Changes are required to human behaviour, technology and processes as part of a holistic solution.
Phishing is a common cybercrime that tempts a target to reveal personal and financial information by imitating a legitimate webpage. Classical techniques, such as list-based, and heuristic approaches have focused on identifying the uniform resource locator (URL). However, cybercriminals have uncovered several methods to evade URL-based techniques. Recently, researchers have started developing techniques that are based on visual similarity to detect phishing webpages. However, using visual similarity raises several computer vision-related issues such as webpage segmentation and feature extraction. Deep learning provides a suitable solution to these issues as it integrates feature extraction, feature selection, and classification in an end-to-end system. We have made the first attempt to detect phishing webpages based on visual similarity by modifying and retraining deep neural networks. A comprehensive evaluation on two publicly available databases has shown a marked improvement of around 7% classification accuracy. (c) 2022 SPIE and IS&T
"Recent work in anthropology proposes that the ethnographic study of infrastructure offers a productive way to think about how states and corporations, citizens and consumers, all define their relations and obligations to each other. This article considers the politics of media infrastructure in Papua New Guinea (PNG) by tracing the moral economy of mobile phones. It focuses on (1) how mobile phone users have taken to social media to express dissatisfaction with the dominant mobile network operator, Digicel, a privately owned foreign company; and (2) how the PNG state has attempted to regulate the use of mobile phones and social media through cybercrime legislation and registration of Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM cards). Consideration of these two issues - matters of concern that gather publics around them - enables an assessment of the promise of improved telecommunications and social media, in particular, to make government in PNG more accountable and transparent."
Sharing incident data among Internet operators is widely seen as an important strategy in combating cybercrime. However, little work has been done to quantify the positive benefits of such sharing. To that end, we report on an observational study of URLs blacklisted for distributing malware that the non-profit anti-malware organization StopBadware shared with requesting web hosting providers. Our dataset comprises over 28 000 URLs shared with 41 organizations between 2010 and 2015. We show that sharing has an immediate effect of cleaning the reported URLs and reducing the likelihood that they will be recompromised. Despite this, we find that long-lived malware takes much longer to clean, even after being reported. Furthermore, we find limited evidence that one-time sharing of malware data improves the malware cleanup response of all providers over the long term. Instead, some providers improve while others worsen.
Authentication is one of the foremost pillars in the Internet of Things (IoT) security that authenticates the identity of a device or a person with the help of a unique identification number. If authentication is compromised then an intruder can gain access and launch a variety of attacks on the network. The world of IoT devices is benefiting us in many ways, but the vulnerability of becoming a victim of cybercrime is also increasing at a rapid pace. This research paper proposes an authentication-based solution for designing a secure communication network to ensure safe access to data and stop attackers from any unauthorized access to various IoT applications using cryptography and cloud computing. The proposed work is then compared with other popular cryptosystems such as Secure Internet of Things (SIT), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Blowfish. LEOBAT is simulated using MATLAB and proves to be a fast and efficient authentication technique.
Many have argued that cloud computing is one of the fastest growing and most transformative technologies in the history of computing. It has radically changed the way in which information technologies can manage, access, deliver and create services. It has also brought numerous benefits to end-users and organizations. However, this rapid growth in cloud computing adoption has also seen it become a new arena for cybercrime. This has, in turn, led to new technical, legal and organizational challenges. In addition to the large number of attacks which affect cloud computing and the decentralized nature of data processing in the cloud, many concerns have been raised. One of these concerns is how to conduct a proper digital investigation in cloud environments and be ready to collect data proactively before an incident occurs in order to save time, money and effort. This paper proposes the technical, legal and organizational factors that influence digital forensic readiness for Infrastructure as a Service consumers.
Numerous ransomware attack was launched at May 2017 since it become emerge as trending for new cybercrime business source income model. The attack to several Big Data Architecture causing problem to over 150 countries. Meanwhile, the research on prevention idea of this attack method are still under struggle. This make ransomware becoming a serious and growing cyber issue. In spite of that, the objective of this paper is to share the application ideas from crypto-ransomware attack method toward future prevention mechanism application to make the Big Data Architecture more immune from future ransomware attack. The method used in this paper is systematic-review. The result is application prevention mechanism named as SeCBD which abbreviation for Secure Big Data. The application idea that result from the systematic review (SeCBD) concludes that most of crypto-ransomware still have chance to disabled, detected, or prevented. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The importance of cyber insurance as a tool for financial resilience to mitigate the accelerating corporate losses caused by cybercrime is growing. However, there exists a lack of standardization and mutual understanding in cyber insurance policies. With less than a third of cyber insurance claims paid in 2017 in the U.S., there exists a significant gap between the cyber risks businesses need to cover and those actually covered through their cyber insurance policies. This research uses inductive qualitative content analysis to examine the existing exclusions in the terms and conditions of 40 German cyber insurers and compares the summarized results with existing cyber risk events. We posit that the lack of understanding of cyber policy wordings related to cyber risks is a significant problem for companies that could suffer significant losses. The resulting categorization of 15 exclusions and interrelationships with cyber risk events will support businesses, the insurance industry, and researchers in their efforts to understand, measure, and manage cyber risk.
The number of botnet attacks has been rapidly increasing in recent years. The threat of botnets constitutes a major security consideration for institutions and organizations concerned with the prevention of cybercrime. Among the most severe of these concerns are those regarding peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet attacks. These botnets present difficulties in local detection, as well as direct challenges to traditional network security practices due to their decentralized nature. We propose a testbed, named BotsideP2P, specialized in the deployment of a P2P botnet with built-in network and endpoint monitoring, so that researchers and industry professionals may gain a better understanding of these botnets in a lab environment. The botnet we have deployed implements a distributed hash table (DHT) to provide bot-to-bot encryption using the Kademlia DHT, and the Asyncio network framework is used for process handling. Emphasis is placed on documenting both the structure of the botnet deployed as well as the logging procedures implemented, and flow data and logs are included in results.
Machine learning (ML) utilisation has achieved a vast global impact. This is evident in the cybersecurity sector, where ML has wide-ranging applications, such as identifying and blocking threats, uncovering unusual software and user behaviour, and many others. However, the increase in successful cyberattacks demonstrates that the effectiveness of ML in cybersecurity applications can be questioned. Although the attacks may be new, ML is often adopted due to its ability to handle diverse and often unforeseen situations - a capability that is not possible using traditional rule-based security mechanisms. As both the rate of attacks and adoption of ML solutions are increasing, there is a need to determine whether ML-based security solutions are meeting the expectations of businesses and whether businesses are genuinely aware of the ML capabilities and limitations. Moreover, current literature shows a significant variation in how ML solutions are evaluated in cybersecurity applications, which might result in a poor understanding of ML capabilities. This paper explores the common perceptions and observations of decision-makers and specialists using ML for cybersecurity regarding its capabilities, implementation, evaluation, and communication. A semi-structured interview is conducted with individuals in various managerial positions to perform this investigation. The finding of this study reveals a pressing need for a standard to manifest ML capabilities. As significant variation in the understanding of Machine Learning Cyber Security (MLCS) capabilities is observed, a standard could help better communicate MLCS capabilities. It is observed that external influences heavily impact ML adoption decisions, potentially leading to misinterpretation of ML capabilities.
"The paper aims to understand the context and drivers of researchers' decision to submit a manuscript to a journal with questionable practices. Using OMICS as a case study and asking authors for their views, the paper presents their profile, motivations and publishing experiences. The methodology is based on a questionnaire sent by e-mail to all authors of articles in journals published by OMICS (+2200). The authors were asked about (a) the factors that influenced their decision to submit their article; (b) their publishing experience with OMICS; (c) their level of satisfaction; and (d) whether or not they would repeat the experience. A total of 86 responses were collected and 18 e-mails were received. The analysis made it possible to add details to the profiles of authors already identified in the literature, but also allowed new and more nuanced profiles. This research extends our knowledge on the phenomenon of predatory publishing from the authors' feedback and provides a better understanding of the socio-economic, psychosocial and geo-political conditions that drive researchers' decisions to submit their work to a possible, potential, or probable predatory journal. At the same time, it reveals some of the strategies used by OMICS to persuade authors to submit their papers. The findings will help to inform institutional policies that seek to put in place efficient measures to combat predatory publishing."
Sexual assault has a devastating effect on survivors as well as their family and friends (i.e., secondary survivors). Research shows that survivors' abilities to cope in the aftermath of sexual trauma are particularly difficult in the internet age. This struggle stems from the abilities of perpetrators to use cyberspace to abuse, harass, and threaten survivors vis-a-vis various cybercrimes: cyberstalking, cybersexual abuse, and cyberfraud. Indeed, a survivor in this study referred to the cybervictimizations as the third-victimization because it followed the sexual assault (first) and the revictimization experienced during the pursuit of justice (second). This article presents the results of semistructured interviews about the third-victimization of 48 female survivors and 89 secondary survivors, the family of the survivor. These results show that all primary and most secondary survivors (91%) experienced at least one third-victimization, with a majority experiencing multiple forms.
The current study is primarily concerned with the developments in financial technology, or fintech, that have significantly altered traditional financial systems, focusing on several risk categories that have emerged in the financial technology sector's digital ecosystem. This paper is a review of existing literature related to the risk landscape in fintech, particularly its publication trend, journal productivity, impact, affiliated organizations, and related themes. A bibliometric and content analysis of 84 articles collected through Scopus' structured database is performed for a comprehensive review. It is revealed that financial technology development has decreased physical crime while simultaneously increasing cybercrime. Another challenge is the asymmetrical technology between financial markets and the relevant supervisors. These current issues necessitate the creation of an Act on Fintech to create a comprehensive legislative framework. The present study's findings are helpful for academia and industry to aid their existing knowledge about fintech and associated risks, particularly its timeline, geographical spread, and development of coherent themes.
This chapter describes statistical approaches to cyber security. Telecommunication and computer network systems form a physical foundation of a cyberspace. Cyberspace is of critical importance to national security and economy. Because cyber attacks and cybercrime pose a considerable and increasing threat to society, security of cyber systems must be improved. In intrusion detection, three fundamental methodologies for cyber attack detection are known, namely anomaly detection, signature recognition, and attack norm separation. Based on these methodologies, various statistical approaches for detecting cyber attacks have been developed. However, cyber attacks continue to evolve. Distributed attacks are emerging that hijack and harvest the power of cloud technologies to cause disruption. System-wide approaches are needed to enable early detection of such attacks. We propose a new graph-based modeling framework and derive a network-based statistical method that could help detect compromised structures in a cyberspace. We illustrate our new approach with an example of a small cyberspace.
As Android Operating System (OS) for mobile computing devices become one of the major trends, the utilization of smartphones set the record for global users and they are taking advantages of the contemporary Instant Messaging (IM) as a convenient tool to communicate with global users in real time because of its competitive rate, high availability, robust reliability, and agile mobility. Undoubtedly, as IM has gradually become one of the channels to commit the cybercrime, the digital evidence collection, analysis, and preservation of the non-volatile data from the Random Access Memory (RAM) of the computing device in terms of cyber trails that were unknowingly left on the crime scene. Hence, this research conducts the design of the experiments to fulfill the essence of contribution of the paper. The Skype Chat and MSN are the popular IM tools, which are widely utilized in contemporary digital era. This paper provides a generic paradigm for the digital forensics specialists and law enforcement agencies to ponder if similar situations are faced.
This article examines the response to online fraud, particularly as it relates to the Australian fraud justice network. Current research indicates that victims overwhelmingly experience a negative response to reporting online fraud. Much of this can be seen to stem from a misunderstanding and unrealistic expectations on what agencies can do, their data sharing practices, and the priority and value they place on victim information. Based upon interviews with 80 Australian victims of online fraud, this article demonstrates a variety of misconceptions held by victims regarding the fraud justice network in responding to online fraud. In doing this, it draws attention to the establishment of the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN) as a central reporting mechanism for online fraud, and highlights the benefits and continued challenges posed by its introduction. It concludes with thoughts how improve online fraud responses, across both victim and fraud justice network perspectives.
Cloak-and-Dagger attacks targeting Android devices can completely hijack the UI feedback loop, with one possible consequence being that of hijacking SMS functionality for cybercrime purposes. What is of particular concern is that attackers can decouple stealth activities from SMS hijacking. Consequently the latter could he pulled off using completely legitimate apps that normally would allow users to manage text messages from their personal computers (SMSonPC), but this time all hidden away under attacker control. This work proposes a digital investigation process aiming to uncover SMS-hijacked devices. It uses bytecode instrumentation in order to force the dumping of volatile memory areas where evidence for the hijack can be located. Eventually both the malware that conceals the SMS-hijacking and the compromised or smuggled SMSonPC app can he identified. Preliminary results are presented using a case study based on the popular SMSonPC app: Pushbullet.
Exploring the challenges of Covid-19 for the European Union (EU) during March-August 2020, this article argues that contrary to prior crises the EU has demonstrated a certain degree of adaptability to a 'permanent' emergency mode. This adaptability varies across policy areas under study. Inter-crisis learning has been higher in state aid and economic governance than in the area of Schengen. Discursive shifts co-exist and have been central to the areas of cybercrime, economic governance and climate change. Additionally, and despite the tensions, there are signs of renewed political commitment to the European project and an acceleration of decisions and initiatives that had been decided or discussed before the pandemic. Although de-politicization and politicization trends continue to co-exist, we observe politicization at the top with European elites perceiving the Covid-19 emergency as an existential threat for the EU. Finally, we argue that the EU's adaptability and acceleration of prior trends do not necessarily involve a race that favor supranational tendencies.
Cyberbullying is a worldwide problem affecting mental health, education, safety and general well-being for individuals across the globe. Despite the widespread availability of the Internet, research into prevalence rates of cyberbullying in Qatar is lacking and legislating for the crime has been slow to develop. Recently there have been some positive initiatives in the country such as a Cybercrime Prevention Law, the development of a National ICI' Strategy, and a website detailing safe practice guidelines for Internet usage. HoWever, the implementation and usage of these initiatives are still limited and there is a lack of awareness of cyberbullying in Qatar. As a result, the risk factors and consequences among school-aged children are unknown. The current paper presents an evaluation of the legislative and public policy solutions to cyberbullying available in Qatar, and outlines the critical challenges that could potentially face educators in shaping best practice guidelines for the future.

"A survey of literature shows that transforming the application files into images and employing deep learning-based models for image classification has been considered as one of the significant directions for malware detection and classification. Mainly, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models are successfully employed for Android malware detection and classification. This is mainly due to the reason that this type of malware detection and classification approach is platform independent and has the capability to detect metamorphic and polymorphic malware. The Image-based Android malware detection is resilient to both unpacked and packed malware. Following, this work employs various 26 CNN-based pretrained models and the detailed investigation and analysis of experiments are shown on the Image-based Android malware dataset. Each of these models have the capability to extract its own optimal features and these features are distinct to each other. The penultimate layer features of best performed CNN-based pretrained models are extracted and dimensionality of the features were reduced using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The reduced features were fused together and passed into a meta-classifier or stacked classifier for classification. This classifier has two levels; in the first level support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RForest) machine learning classifier were included for prediction and logistic regression in the second level for classification. The four combinations of fused models are DenseNet, ResNet, InceptionResNet, and EfficientNet. EfficientNet-based fused models showed better performances compared to other fused models and non-fused CNN based pretrained models. Moreover, the EfficientNet-based fused models outperformed the existing approaches for Android malware detection. All the model performances were shown on two different testing datasets and the proposed model has shown the similar performances on both the testing datasets with attaining better performances during training and testing. This indicates that the proposed model is more generalizable, robust, and it can be used as tool that can be deployed in any application play store."
Taiwan has become the frontline in an emerging cyberspace battle. Cyberattacks from different countries are constantly reported during past decades. The incident of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is analyzed from the golden triangle components (people, process and technology) to ensure the application of digital forensics. This study presents a novel People-Process-Technology-Strategy (PPTS) model by implementing a triage investigative step to identify evidence dynamics in digital data and essential information in auditing logs. The result of this study is expected to improve APT investigation. The investigation scenario of this proposed methodology is illustrated by applying to some APT incidents in Taiwan.
The present article attempts to study the role of financial risk management in the digital economy era. The main purpose of the article is to identify the main patterns that determine the features of risk assessment in business as the main element contributing to the achievement of economic security of the organization, as well as to carry out a comparative analysis of risk assessment and risk management methods in the context of digitalization. The contemporary economic analysis employs various risk management methods. Digitalization also creates new risks, most of which are related to cybercrime and fraud on the Internet. The most effective ways to reduce risk in the context of instability of the economic and political situation in Russia are the scenarios method and the method of analyzing hierarchies, as well as diversification, i.e. the distribution of risks among several business participants. The article discusses various types of economic risks, risk analysis, and assessment methods, as well as risk neutralizing strategies.
Cybercrime is referred to as aggressive, intentional act performed through electronic communications. In recent years, lack of awareness regarding technological advancements has paved the way for an intense increase in various types of aggressive cyber-attacks such as phishing, scamming, hacking etc. Under-reporting of cybercrimes serves as a major impediment in efficient and timely handling of cybercrimes, and hence can cause serious consequences. Manually staying informed regarding emerging cybersecurity threats is a time taking and laborious task, creating the need of developing robust systems that could efficiently report news related to cybercrimes. This requires development of information retrieval models to extract cybersecurity news belonging to different categories from various online resources. The focus of this research is to propose a model for detection of cyber offences reported on news articles and blogs. Further in order to analyze the authenticity of news obtained via news articles/blogs, a novel source verification model is proposed by investigating various authenticity parameters and assigning weightages to these parameters.
Conventional terrorism has been around for hundreds of years and even though its tactics and the weapons of choice have evolved over time as well as the use and deployment of weapons may have changed the root definition of terrorism has remained relatively untouched. With the advent of mass computing, cybercrime has increased year on year. This chapter will look at three differing viewpoints of cyberterrorism and its ultimate effects on society. Many industry and academic experts warn that it is only a matter of time before conventional terrorist acts will migrate to the digital arena in the form of cyberterrorism. Current literature suggests that a countries critical national infrastructure will be the main focus of attack for the cyberterrorist but this chapter will address another possible target for the cyberterrorist using a different type of cyber weapon: a mimetic virus. This chapter also looks at how a mimetic virus could use social media to spread throughout the target audience using what is known as Internet memes.
Social Networking Service (SNS) emerges to be one of the most promising directions of web applications regarding the next generation of Internet technology evolutions. Substantively, innumerable global on-line community members share common interests with each other via the User Generated Content (UGC) platforms. Facebook is one of them and it facilitates the social networking participants to deliver the digital contents to authorized consumers or specific groups. As cybercrimes mushroom in recent years, more and more digital crime investigations have strong relations to Facebook. Unarguably, Facebook has been exploited via global perpetrators. Consequently, we spotlight on live data acquisition within the RAM of the desktop PC with emphasis on some distinct strings that could be found in order to reconstruct the previous Facebook session, which plays an extremely precious role for the associate digital forensics investigators to incubate additional thoughtful decisions concerning the discovery of breadcrumb digital evidences in this unparalleled cybercrime incidents era.
Illicit activity in cryptocurrency has increased dramatically over the years. Bitcoin mechanics allow for users to mask their identity through obfuscation techniques. Much research has been published in the domain of identifying illicit activity in cryptocurrency, and in particular the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great promise in this area. In this paper, we propose two graph preprocessing methods to improve performance and robustness of our node classification GNN models in identifying illicit transactions in the Bitcoin network. Our methods focus on graph restructuring through measuring the connectivity of nodes in a graph, and the similarity of the underlying features each node possesses. We demonstrate the graph restructuring methodologies on five GNN architectures and empirically show an improvement of evaluation metrics when compared against the unprocessed graph dataset. We compare our proposed methods against other imbalanced node classification techniques on a common graph dataset. This methodology has great opportunity in the transaction monitoring landscape for exchanges and financial institutions attempting to capture potential illicit activity taking place on their networks including money laundering.
The relevance of the article lies in the fact that in the conditions of intensive expansion of information flow information security has become the least protected element of national security, especially in Ukraine. The purpose of the research is to study the effectiveness of the activity of state bodies, to analyse regulatory acts of the Republic of Estonia and to determine the possibility of their adaptation in Ukraine. The features of information security in the Republic of Estonia are considered in the article. It is noted that the main factors that have helped to increase the level of information security in Estonia are the developed information infrastructure, effective cybersecurity policy and reliable protection of personal data. Cybersecurity has been found to depend on combating cybercrime, improving critical infrastructure and e-services, and providing national defence. Practical recommendations are given regarding Ukraine's acquisition of Estonia's experience in the field of information security.
Online cybercriminal communities exist in various geopolitical regions, including America, China, Russia, and more. Some multilingual forums exist where cybercriminals of differing geopolitical origin interact and exchange hacking knowledge and cybercriminal assets. Researchers can study such forums to better understand the global cybercriminal supply chain and cybercrime trends. However, little work has focused on identifying members of different language groups and geopolitical origin within such forums. One challenge is the necessity of a technique that scales across multiple languages. We are motivated to explore computational techniques that support automated and scalable categorization of cybercriminal forum participants into varying language groups. In particular, we make use of Paragraph Vectors, a state-of-the-art neural network language model to generate fixed-length vector representations (i.e., document embeddings) of messages posted by forum participants. Results indicate Paragraph Vectors outperforms traditional n-gram frequency approaches for generating document embeddings that are useful for clustering cybercriminals into language groups.
Sometimes, machine learning models can determine the trajectory of human life, and a series of cascading ethical failures could be irreversible. Ethical concerns are nevertheless set to increase, in particular when the injection of algorithmic forms of decision-making occurs in highly sensitive security contexts. In cybercrime, there have been cases of algorithms that have not identified racist and hateful speeches, as well as missing the identification of Image Based Sexual Abuse cases. Hence, this paper intends to add a voice of caution on the vulnerabilities pervading the different stages of a machine learning development pipeline and the ethical challenges that these potentially nurture and perpetuate. To highlight both the issues and potential fixes in an adversarial environment, we use Child Sexual Exploitation and its implications on the Internet as a case study, being 2021 its worst year according to the Internet Watch Foundation.
Understanding perception and risk behavior of citizens in a particular country can influence policies that leads to creation of appropriate cyber laws that guarantees citizens' security and privacy in cyber related transactions. UAE cyber activity and perception data is compared with data from nine developed nations. Results obtained have shown that with respect to monetary loss due to cybercrime versus relative risk, UAE is at par with Canada. Combination of results obtained suggests a need for aggressive promotion of cybersecurity awareness program in UAE. Although digital maturity, access to Internet and cybersecurity awareness in UAE may be low compared to other developed nations, cyber risk behavior is comparatively the same as in other nine developed nations. One major contribution of this research is that methodologies are presented that can be used in developing cybersecurity assessment of cybersecurity risk behaviors, and comparison of cyber related risk behavior among countries.
The emergence of a preventive cybersecurity paradigm that aims to eliminate the sources of cybercrime threats is becoming an increasingly necessary complement to the current self-defensive cybersecurity systems. One concern associated with adopting such preventive measures is the risk of privacy infringement. Therefore, it is necessary to design the future Internet infrastructure so that it can appropriately balance preventive cybersecurity measures with privacy protections. This research proposes to design the Internet infrastructure using the preventive cybersecurity measures of the Bright Internet, namely preventive cybersecurity protocol and identifiable anonymity protocol, and ten privacy rights derived from Europe's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). We then analyze the legitimacy of the five steps of the preventive cybersecurity protocol and the four features of the identifiable anonymity protocol from the perspectives of ten privacy rights. We address the legitimacy from the perspective of potential victims' self-defense rights. Finally, we discuss four potential risks that may occur to the innocent senders and proposed resilient recovery procedures.
Cybercrime in the health sector is a growing threat in the digital age. With computerization of medical records and telemedicine on the rise, cyberattacks can have devastating consequences. Leaking sensitive data or hijacking systems can compromise patient's privacy and jeopardize healthcare. To counter this threat, robust cybersecurity measures are required as a protective measure. This article aims to expose the main dangers and threats faced by ICT, as well as present cybersecurity with its bioethical implications and, finally, the ideal scheme for it in the health sector in order to create a safer and more efficient environment. This article aims to address these issues and provide a comprehensive view of how cybersecurity and ICT can coexist safely and effectively in the healthcare field. (c) 2024 The Authors.

As compared to women in industrialized and developed nations, household women in Iraq do not lead standard lives. The proliferation of digital media platforms for communication has led to an upsurge in cyberbullying of household women in Iraq. In Iraq, there are only a few laws against cyberbullying, and the current structure of government and justice does not adequately protect women from this type of abuse. In order to understand the causes and prevalence of cyberbullying of women in Iraq, interviews with various Iraqi women were performed as part of this study. The results of this study show that cyberbullying against women in Iraq is a result of illiteracy, a lack of resources, and the absence of contemporary criminal legislation. The study comes to the conclusion that the Iraqi government can lessen the practice of cyberbullying against women by improving police administration and the criminal justice system. The study has crucial theoretical and practical ramifications for Iraq's efforts to outlaw cyberbullying and cybercrime against women.
Nowadays, the Internet has penetrated into every corner of people's lives. It brings convenience to my life as well as certain risks. Millions of new types of malware appear every day, affecting thousands or even millions of home computer users. And attackers can use fully automated design and reuse malware, which makes the threshold for cybercrime lower and lower. Therefore, we urgently need a detection technology that can be applied to the current rapidly changing malware ecosystem. Based on the fact that the implementation of software functions must use Windows API functions, this paper proposes to dynamically extract the API call sequence patterns of different categories of malware, then used FastText as the classifier and word representation. The model is applied to two open malware datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has high detection rate and low false alarm rate, which proves that it can effectively detect and classify malware.
The studies on underground forums and marketplaces have significantly advanced our understandings of cybercrime workflows and underground economies. Researchers of underground economies have conducted comprehensive studies on public interactions. However, little research focuses on private interactions. The lack of the investigation on private interactions may cause misunderstandings on underground economies, as users in underground forums and marketplaces tend to share the minimal amount of information in public interactions and resort to private messages for follow-up conversations. In this paper, we propose methods to investigate the underground private interactions and we analyze a recently leaked dataset from Nulled.io. We present analyses on the contents and purposes of private messages. In addition, we design machine learning-based models that only use the publicly available information to detect if two underground users privately communicate with each other. Finally, we perform adversarial analysis to evaluate the robustness of the detector to different types of attacks.
Cyber-incidents threaten the confidentiality, efficiency, and integrity of digital information systems, causing privacy risks, economic losses, and reputational damages, and exposing managerial limitations. Although these phenomena are becoming more frequent in public agencies, research to date has mainly focused on private sector organizations and individuals. In this study, we contribute to the broader literature on cyber-incidents by exploring the drivers of both security breaches and unauthorized data disclosures in public organizations. Drawing from routine activity theory, we develop hypotheses on the determinants of cyber-incidents in departments in small and medium-sized US cities and test them using data from a national survey of public managers. Our findings suggest that both environmental and organizational factors are key determinants of cyber-incidents in city government. The results demonstrate the application of routine activity theory to public sector organizations and identify external and internal elements related to cyber-incidents in city government departments.
Cybercrime around the world is increasing day by day abruptly. Stego attack is one of the popular methods of transferring the message secretly through the cover medium. Most of the sources are using this process for covert communication. The paper discusses the importance and analysis of data hiding theft and covert communication process through steganalysis where it talks about the covered writing in such a way that the mutation of an image is not discernible. The main motive of this paper is to attack and analyze the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file format. The file format DICOM discussed in this research is mostly supported in the medical field. CT Scans and MRI Scans are widely used in hospitals to view the human body. The random pixels is chosen to hide the text on the DICOM formats and the performance is measured using different metrics. The proposed approach produces 100% recovery of the hidden text inside an image with maximum payload capacity.
Global crime governance has become a major area of international activity, including a growing number of public and private regulatory efforts. Yet it is puzzling that a considerable variance exists in how state and non-state actors interact: non-state actors have been important agenda-setters in some issue areas, while they have been absent in others. Sometimes they are implementation bodies, sometimes they set regulations themselves. I argue that this variance is caused by issue characteristics: If an issue area is framed in a highly moralised way, it is likely that resulting non-governmental activity can be explained by normative convictions, and in particular advocacy occurs frequently. If an issue area is framed in a technical way, resource exchange is central, and delegation to non-state actors becomes more prominent. A comparison of human trafficking, conflict diamonds, money laundering and cybercrime shows that this relation can be found on the global and national level.
Information technology is developing rapidly today, which makes our life more convenient. Network is not only one of the important information technology products, but it also brings cybercrime, for example, Botnet infected and controlled computers which are usually established through a virus infection in many organizations, such as companies, schools or our home. Botnet do DDOS, phishing, sending spam and stealing of personal information. Every year the amount of infected victims is increasing. The botnet detection is more important day after day. However, Botnet often changed communication tools and transmission to hide, the detection has become difficult and botnet have multiple different implementations. We analyze three types of botnet traffic. There are IRC based, HTTP based and Peer to Peer based botnet. In this paper we construct simulation network to obtain different botnet traffic and extract flow data as some features. To find the important feature of botnet traffic, we use the Support Vector Machine as classifier with Swarm intelligence.
Students at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) may be potential victims of cyber-crime. Students need to know how to avoid being victims of cybercrime and may not know how to gain the knowledge. Electronic Safety (e-Safety) education and awareness can be accomplished through game based media such as educational video games. However, these games mostly focus on narrow aspects, such as anti-phishing, secure logins, anti-virus etc., and are often not readily available. To gain full advantage of game based tools, e-Safety games need to be customised to satisfy the targeted organisation's security policies and needs. This study aims to propose a game-based e-learning model focusing on e-Safety education. As proof of concept a proposed prototype model will be developed, implemented and evaluated. The model is expected to unleash game-based learning benefits by enhancing engagement, improving motivation and influencing positive behaviour towards e-Safety education.
In this article, a comprehensive approach to information sharing framework aimed at increasing network security and survivability is presented. Currently, in order to defend complex cyber-attacks and sophisticated cybercrime, comprehensive means of ensuring network security and survivability are highly demanded. Comprehensive is understood as (at least) technical, human, organizational, and regulatory dimensions, whereas technical means that both on-line and off-line aspects should be carefully taken into account. The focus of this article is on the technical dimension and, in particular, on information exchange mechanisms for on-line and off-line dimension. Firstly, the on-line information exchange mechanism dedicated for interconnected federated networks is described. Then, a proposition of the off-line network information sharing approach regarding results of the risk assessment, cybersecurity audits, threat ranking, etc., is discussed. Developments and results of information sharing mechanisms in both on-line and off-line network security dimensions are also described.
While many attacks are distributed across botnets, investigators and network operators have recently identified malicious networks through high profile autonomous system (AS) depeerings and network shutdowns. In this paper, we explore whether some ASs indeed are safe havens for malicious activity. We look for ISPs and ASs that exhibit disproportionately high malicious behavior using 10 popular blacklists, plus local spam data, and extensive DNS resolutions based on the contents of the blacklists. We find that some ASs have over 80% of their routable IP address space blacklisted. Yet others account for large fractions of blacklisted IP addresses. Several ASs regularly peer with ASs associated with significant malicious activity. We also find that malicious ASs as a whole differ from benign ones in other properties not obviously related to their malicious activities, such as more frequent connectivity changes with their BGP peers. Overall, we conclude that examining malicious activity at AS granularity can unearth networks with lax security or those that harbor cybercrime.
Podslurping is the intentional or unintentional use of a portable USB mass storage device, such as a USB flash drive (or thumb drive), to illicitly download and store confidential and proprietary data from network endpoint [1]. There are many establishments and organization that are unaware of, or choose to remain ignorant about the threat that can be caused by portable devices in their network setting until some events that can be from a minor unfortunate incident to a complete catastrophe. In the information age, cybercrime and information leakage increase, because endpoints are an easy target [2]. The key to managing portable devices in business environment is to give administrator direct control over what devices are in use on your network. In this paper we present the implementation of access and identity management for endpoint protection and data security from USB devices to maintain information security and data theft prevention in a corporate environment.
Cybercrime is a multifaceted and forever changing phenomenon. It is found that Cyber criminals who are becoming more classy and stylish are making consumers of both private and public organizations their prey. To prevent attacks additional layers of defense are required. It has been observed that Cyber crime has increased in density and complexity and financial costs ever since organizations have adopted the use of computers in carrying out their business processes. An example of the case studies carried out on cyber crimes is the Parliament attack case. The main points discussed in this chapter are Cyber crime and cyber security, the unusual cyber crimes that we come across. Various prevention techniques and detection techniques like Tripwires, Honey Pots, anomaly detection system, configuration checking tools and operating system commands, various acts that have been imposed against Cyber crime and online safety tips are also discussed.
Researchers have begun to explore the problem of mass data breaches, where consumer information is acquired by cybercriminals and sold in open markets on-line. Although studies document the social processes of the market and relationships between buyers and sellers, few have considered the revenues earned from market transactions. This study explored these issues using a sample of threads from 10 Russian language and 3 English language Web forums used to sell stolen data. Estimates were generated on the total number of transactions completed by participants along with the advertised prices for the two most common forms of personal information sold. The findings demonstrated that buyers may earn a range of revenues from the sale of stolen data, although this figure was smaller than the potential profits earned from fraudulent use and identity crimes by data buyers. The implications of this study for cybercrime research and policy are explored in detail.
The disruptive shift of technologies in the Internet age poses the challenge of securing our digital asset and cyberspace from large-scale, sophisticatedly targeted offenses and cybercrimes. As a response, many governments have introduced mandatory notification schemes in which an entity bears an obligation to notify the regulator and affected individuals if personal data it holds is compromised. Focusing on Australia's Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) scheme introduced in 2018, this paper points out that the NDB scheme gives entities that should be responsible for data protection much leeway while holding individuals, only victims of a data breach, responsible for dealing with the consequences. This is problematic as redressing the grievances caused by a data breach is difficult in the Australian context. It is difficult for a victim of a breach of privacy to bring an action in court mainly because there is no established tort of privacy in Australia. Further, bringing a class action for data breaches is a difficult process. We suggest that the real effect of the NDB scheme requires an understanding in a broader context of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Regulated in a broader APPs context, the NDB scheme could become a part of a privacy protection regime that requires public agencies and businesses to have better accountability and responsibility mechanisms.

To expedite the forensic investigation process in the cloud, excessive and yet volatile data need to be acquired, transmitted, and analyzed in a timely manner. A common assumption for most existing forensic systems is that credible data can always be collected from a cloud infrastructure, which might be susceptible to various exploits. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of LiveForen, a system that enforces a trustworthy forensic data acquisition and transmission process in the cloud, whose computer platforms' integrity has been verified. To fulfill this objective, we propose two secure protocols that verify the fingerprints of the computer platforms, as well as the attributes of the human agents, by taking advantage of the trusted platform module and the attribute-based encryption. To transmit forensic data as a data stream and verify its integrity at the same time, a unique fragile watermark is embedded into the data stream without altering the data itself. The watermark allows not only the data integrity to be verified but also any malicious data manipulation to be localized, with minimum communication overhead. The experimental results demonstrate that LiveForen achieves good scalability and limited performance overhead for authentication, data transmission, and integrity verification in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud environment.
"Revenge pornography, or non-consensual dissemination of sexually explicit material, has become a new cyber offence where the perpetrators target the sexual integrity of the victims by sharing the sexually explicit media of a victim online, and therefore seriously damaging both the sexual integrity and identity of the victim. Thus, mainly in countries with Anglo-American law systems, revenge pornography is being treated as a serious sexual offence. On the other hand, the traditional criminal law concept in countries adhering to the continental law system is firmly anchored in the belief that the attacked virtue of revenge pornography is the right to privacy of an individual. Therefore, criminalising revenge pornography only as a privacy violation crime. Consequently, the offence in these countries is not taken as seriously, or punished as harshly, as is the case involving sexual offences. The purpose of this article is multifold: to suggest an ideal criminal law definition for revenge pornography; to explore some dilemmas that the continental criminal law doctrine is facing when dealing with revenge pornography; and to compare criminal law legislations of certain countries of central Europe in order to explicitly propose specific legislative solutions."
This chapter explores collective information processing among black-hat hackers during their crises events. The chapter presents a preliminary study on one of Tor-based darknet market forums, during the shutdowns of two cryptomarkets. Content and network analysis of forum conversations showed that blackhat users mostly engaged with rational information processing and were adept at reaching collective solutions by sharing security advices, new market information, and alternative routes for economic activities. At the same time, the study also found that anti-social and distrustful interactions were aggravated during the marketplace shutdowns. Communication network analysis showed that not all members were affected by the crisis events, alluding to a fragmented network structure of black-hat markets. The chapter concludes that, while darknet forums may constitute resilient, solution-oriented users, market crises potentially make the community vulnerable by engendering internal distrust.
As computing and communication technologies become ubiquitous throughout society, researchers and practitioners have become motivated to advance current cybersecurity capabilities. In particular, research on the human element behind cybercrime would offer new knowledge on securing cyberspace against those with malicious intent. Past work documents the existence of many hacker communities with participants sharing various cybercriminal assets and knowledge. However, participants vary in expertise, with some possessing only passing curiosity while others are capable cybercriminals. Here we develop a time-to-event based approach for assessing the relationship between various participation behaviors and participation length among hacker Internet Relay Chat (IRC) community participants. Using both the Kaplan-Meier model and Cox's model, we are able to develop predictions on individuals' participation trajectory based on a series of message content and social network features. Results indicate that participation volume, discussion of pertinent topics, and social interconnectedness are all important at varying levels for identifying participants within hacker communities that have potential to become adept cybercriminals.
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities remain more digital excluded than many other groups within society. Perceived vulnerability of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by those providing support may increase their digital exclusion and the digital divide. Few studies have considered online risk from the perspective of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Online risks have previously been classified as contact, conduct and content but little is known about how adults with intellectual disabilities experience these specific risks. Underpinned by post-postivist and phenomenological epistemologies, perceptions and meanings of online risks for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities were gathered. Individual interviews were conducted with thirteen adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who all identified themselves as self advocates. Interview discussions considered online risk experiences of being online and using social media. Data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Overarching themes of risk experiences, awareness and support to manage salient risks, and developing independence and resilience through online participation were identified. Accounts also identified concerns around online risks and carer gatekeeping as potential instrumental factors in digital exclusion, such exclusion was considered detrimental to wellbeing. Adults with intellectual disabilities with low support needs appeared more able to manage online risk than may be presupposed by a vulnerability-focused perspective. The importance of utilising language salient to the person when discussing risk was also highlighted. Experiential learning to better understand and manage salient online risks appears a way forward for both research and practice.
The rapid development of information technology and the problem of its rapid implementation in all spheres of public life, the growing importance of information in management decisions to be made by public authorities, a new format of media - these and other factors urge the problem of developing and implementing quality state information security policy. The aim of the article was to conduct a comparative analysis of the latest practices of improving public information security policies in the European Union, as well as European countries such as Poland, Germany, Great Britain, and Ukraine. The formal-logic, system-structural and problemtheoretical methods were the leading methodological tools. The analysis of regulatory legal acts showed that there is a single concept of international information security at the global and regional levels, which requires additional legal instruments for its implementation. It is stated that the reform of national information security policies has a direct impact on the formation of a single global information space. According to the results of the study, it is substantiated that the United Kingdom is characterized by the most promising information security policy.
"With the widespread concerns about cyber terrorism and the frequent use of the term cyber terrorism at the present time, many international organisations have made efforts to combat this threat. Since cyber terrorism is an international crime, local regulations alone are not able to defend against such attacks; they require a transnational response. Therefore, an attacked country will invoke international law to seek justice for any damage caused, through the exercise of universal jurisdiction. Without the aid of international organisations, it is difficult to prevent cyber terrorism. At the same time, international organisations determine which state court, or international court, has the authority to settle a dispute. The objective of this paper is to analyse and review the effectiveness and sufficiency of the current global responses to cyber terrorism through the exercise of international jurisdiction. This article also touches upon the notion of cyber terrorism as a transnational crime and an international threat; thus, national regulations alone cannot prevent it. The need for an international organisation to prevent and defend nations from cyber terrorism attacks is pressing. This paper finds that, as cyber terrorism is a transnational crime, it should be subjected to universal jurisdiction through multinational cooperation, and this would be the most suitable method to counter future transnational crimes such as cyber terrorism.

As part of their role, digital forensic practitioners are often faced with case-specific investigative inquiries which they must attempt to address and provide an appropriate answer to their client. Such investigative questions can take many forms wherein every instance, any response they offer must be reliable. To be reliable, any response to an inquiry must be derived from justifiable and robust processes and information, coined here as the underpinning scaffolding. This work offers a discussion of response scaffolding, what it is and why it is required in digital forensics with the three ways that this can be achieved outlined-via past experience, targeted testing or through reference to appropriate existing bodies of knowledge. Each one is examined in turn and their use is demonstrated via an overarching hypothetical example which is deployed and utilized throughout the analysis narrative for illustrative purposes. This article is categorized under: Digital and Multimedia Science > Cybercrime Investigation
"Cybercrime analysis reports state that the crime percentage has been doubled from past 3 to 4 years, and most of the crimes are being successful due to the lack of proper identity verification mechanism that is nothing but the authenticity verificationmechanism. The authentication of the user can be done by various authentication protocols but still, the attacks are being success; this shows the necessity of improving the efficiency of the authentication algorithms, and this can be done accurately by analysis various existingmechanisms proposed by various researchers. On analyzing the various protocols of authentication, the loop pits of the existing schemes can be recorded, which gives an ideology of filling the loopholes of the same. Therefore, this paper analyzes the most recently proposed multifactor authentication scheme by Mishra et al. Based on various characteristics that are to be considered in designing an authentication protocol, the scheme is been analyzed. A detailed explanation of various vulnerabilities of Mishra et al.'s scheme is given in this paper."
This paper presents a novel, interdisciplinary insider threat prediction and prevention model which combines several approaches, techniques and tools from computer science, criminology and psychology. It is based on the fraud diamond which comprises four components: pressure (i.e. motive), opportunity, capability and rationalisation. In general, it has been found that a criminal must have the motive and opportunity to commit a crime. However, the criminal must also have the capability to commit crime particularly in the cybercrime domain. Furthermore, criminals tend to rationalise (i.e. excuse) their crimes. The model presented here involves leveraging the fraud diamond to predict and prevent insider threats. Typically insider threat prediction and prevention models tend to overlook the privacy concerns of insiders. Hence the deployment of the model involves gathering information about the insider's possible intent within a privacy-preserving context. This will help to identify high risk insider threats while balancing privacy concerns.
Cybercrime is on the rise and it's widely believed that an appropriate cyber hygiene is essential to secure our digital lives. The expression cyber hygiene appears in conversations, conferences, scientific articles, legal texts, governmental publications and commercial websites. However, what cyber hygiene is, what is appropriate or optimal cyber hygiene, or what is really meant by this expression and related practices-that is often varying and even somewhat contradicting. We review and analyze selected academic papers, government and corporate publications with the focus on implicit and explicit definitions of what cyber hygiene means to the authors. We also draw parallels and contrast the expression in cyber security context and terminology (cyber awareness, behavior and culture). We present a conceptual analysis and propose a definition to assist in achieving a universal understanding and approach to cyber hygiene. This work is intended to stimulate a clarifying discussion of what appropriate cyber hygiene is, how it should be defined and positioned in the wider cyber security context in order to help changing the human behavior for achieving a more secure connected world.
Earlier, in [1-5], we presented a case study of a cybercrime w. r. t. tripartite case of cybercrimes of (1) Violation of State Emblem of India Prevention of Improper Use Act 2005 (2) Cheating crime and (3) Sedition crime [6]. The cybercrimes were perpetrated by the culprit organization, JNTUHJAC, which was operational in the JNTUH University overtly and covertly. The case was based on web mining [7] results drawn from the web crawler tool, Wayback machine [8]. W. r. t. the case, the charge sheet was detailed in [5]. In this paper, we present the judgment in the aftermath of the chargesheet [4, 9]. We present that the Cyberabad police failed to make use of the cyberforensic evidence in handling the case. We present that the significance of Cyberethics in the case. Policing and judiciary are not just sufficient in handling cybercrimes. Cybercounseling and guidance is crucial in generating public opinion, national integration and academic development to remedy the flaws in handling the cybercrimes by organizational means such as police dept. and judiciary.
In the past decade the increase of for-profit cybercrime has given rise to an entire underground ecosystem supporting large-scale abuse, a facet of which encompasses the bulk registration of fraudulent accounts. In this paper, we present a 10 month longitudinal study of the underlying technical and financial capabilities of criminals who register phone verified accounts (PVA). To carry out our study, we purchase 4,695 Google PVA as well as pull a random sample of 300,000 Google PVA that Google disabled for abuse. We find that miscreants rampantly abuse free VOIP services to circumvent the intended cost of acquiring phone numbers, in effect undermining phone verification. Combined with short lived phone numbers from India and Indonesia that we suspect are tied to human verification farms, this confluence of factors correlates with a market-wide price drop of 30-40% for Google PVA until Google penalized verifications from frequently abused carriers. We distill our findings into a set of recommendations for any services performing phone verification as well as highlight open challenges related to PVA abuse moving forward.
The advancement of technology has paved the way for a new type of bullying, which often leads to negative stigma in the social setting. Cyberbullying is a cybercrime wherein one individual becomes the target of harassment and hatred. It has recently become more prevalent due to a rise in the usage of social media platforms, and, in some severe situations, it has even led to victims' suicides. In the literature, several cyberbullying detection methods are proposed, but they are mainly focused on word-based data and user account attributes. Furthermore, most of them are related to the English language. Meanwhile, only a few papers have studied cyberbullying detection in Arabic social media platforms. This paper, therefore, aims to use machine learning in the Arabic language for automatic cyberbullying detection. The proposed mechanism identifies cyberbullying using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm by using a real dataset obtained from YouTube and Twitter to train and test the classifier. Moreover, we include the Farasa tool to overcome text limitations and improve the detection of bullying attacks.
Technology has had a vertiginous advance and the law must be present in the invention of the Metaverse, -beyond the universe, -people will carry out a large number of legal, educational, sports, cultural, social acts, among others, that will impact on their lives, they will do it through a representation through the avatar in a virtual world, that there must be transparency and ethical principles, to be protected against illegality and cybercrime. Education about this technology that teaches students must instill ethical values. The conclusion of contracts is possible in this digital medium. The objective of the research is to create awareness among the public interested in learning about this innovative and useful world. The method used was carried out through documentary study and personal analysis with information from serious and current technological publications. The main results are to establish the importance of transparency in the metaverse, and the care applied and included in the legal world. In future studies, aspects and legal figures should be created that are applied in said universe when staging scenarios.
"The aim of this study was to examine the optimal types and measures of legal liability for crimes in the field of illicit trade in pharmaceuticals in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research used methods of systematic approach, descriptive analysis, synthesis and prognosis, systematic and formal legal and comparative selection. It has been established that illicit trade in pharmaceuticals is carried out by organized criminal groups and is related to corruption and cybercrime. Also, the article has revealed typical legal flaws, which complicate international cooperation in this field and lead to noncompliance with international standards of criminalization and imposition of sanctions for illegal circulation of counterfeit medicines. All this leads to the conclusion that the illicit trade in pharmaceuticals manifests itself in a series of offenses for which administrative or criminal liability must be foreseen. Equally promising is the development of a model for law enforcement activity that includes criminalization of trade in low-quality, unregistered and counterfeit pharmaceuticals, according to international standards; proportional punishments for natural persons and influence measures for legal persons and compensation for their victims."
"In the UK schools are required by law to protect students from bullying; the responsibility of teachers to govern such behaviour has been extended outside the school setting to include cyberbullying. In this investigation, cyberbullying in secondary education is explored from the student perspective using a qualitative method of enquiry. Reported awareness and understanding about the legal aspects of cyberbullying are investigated; consideration is given to legislation, cybercrime, children's rights, school sanctions and safeguarding responsibilities. A total of 197 male and female students aged between 11 and 14 years old participated. Despite the availability of information on guidelines and legislation at national, local, and school level, this does not appear to have reached ground level of the individual student. There is a considerable gap between what students should know and what they report to be aware of with regard to legal aspects of cyberbullying. To address concerns of keeping up with the pace of change in cyberbullying, a collaborative approach is required with young people and adults sharing expertise."
One of the challenges in fighting cybercrime is to understand the dynamics of message propagation on botnets, networks of infected computers used to send viruses, unsolicited commercial emails ( SPAM) or denial of service attacks. We map this problem to the propagation of multiple random walkers on directed networks and we evaluate the interarrival time distribution between successive walkers arriving at a target. We show that the temporal organization of this process, which models information propagation on unstructured peer to peer networks, has the same features as SPAM reaching a single user. We study the behavior of the message interarrival time distribution on three different network topologies using two different rules for sending messages. In all networks the propagation is not a pure Poisson process. It shows universal features on Poissonian networks and a more complex behavior on scale free networks. Results open the possibility to indirectly learn about the process of sending messages on networks with unknown topologies, by studying interarrival times at any node of the network.
We present a new approach to tackle the problem of metamorphic robots' reconfiguration. Given the chain-type metamorphic robot's initial and target configuration, we compute a reconfiguration plan that is provably physically collision-free. Our solution employs a specific heuristic. The robot initially reconfigures to a shape that resembles an octopus with many tentacles. After that, the tentacles gradually reconnect to each other using inverse kinematics, separating one tentacle from the body and keeping the other one connected. This strategy eventually leads to a snake-like structure of the robot. For the target configuration, we compute the reconfiguration plan with the same procedure, however, we reverse the plan to reconfigure the robot from the snake-like structure to the target shape. According to our experimental evaluation, our newly introduced strategy for finding reconfiguration plans is successful. It efficiently finds collision-free plans even for robots consisting of hundreds of modules.
For several years there has been debate among EU Member States on the need to regulate cross-border access to electronic data used as evidence in criminal proceedings and how best to do this. The existing model of cooperation, based mainly on bilateral agreements, appears dysfunctional and is perceived by many as a barrier to effectively combatting rising cross-border crime. In response, work has begun on several new legal mechanisms, most importantly the draft e-Evidence Regulation from the European Commission and a proposal to extend the Convention on Cybercrime - already in operation for almost 20 years - with an additional new protocol. At the same time, the United States has proposed its own model of cooperation, arising from the CLOUD Act. This article discusses the current state of play and the expected shape of future regulations - in terms of both facilitating law enforcement cooperation and clarifying obligations imposed on digital service providers.
Malicious software, popularly known as malware, is a serious threat to modern computing systems. A comprehensive cybercrime study by Ponemon Institute highlights that malware is the most expensive attack for organizations, with an average revenue loss of $2.6 million per organization in 2018 (11% increase compared to 2017). Recent high-profile malware attacks coupled with serious economic implications have dramatically changed our perception of threat from malware. Software-based solutions, such as anti-virus programs, are not effective since they rely on matching patterns (signatures) that can be easily fooled by carefully crafted malware with obfuscation or other deviation capabilities. Moreover, software-based solutions are not fast enough for real-time malware detection in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we investigate promising approaches for hardware-assisted malware detection using machine learning. Specifically, we explore how machine learning can be effective for malware detection utilizing hardware performance counters, embedded trace buffer as well as on-chip network traffic analysis.
EXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research area relating to the creation of machine learning algorithms from which explanations for outputs are provided. In many fields, such as law enforcement, it is necessary that decisions made by and with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools can be justified and explained to a human. We seek to explore the potential of XAI to further enhance triage and analysis of digital forensic evidence, using examples of the current state of the art as a starting point. This opinion letter will discuss both practical and novel ideas as well as controversial points for leveraging XAI to improve the efficacy of digital forensic (DF) analysis and extract forensically sound pieces of evidence (also known as artifacts) that could be used to assist investigations and potentially in a court of law.

Phishing is one of the cybercrime methods which seems to be increasing steadily targeting unsuspecting users. Nowadays, the impact of phishing extended to include organizations that provide services via the Internet. Such organizations become more susceptible to lose their reputation and their competitive edges because of phishing. Classifying a website into a phishing or legitimate depends mainly on the status of a set of significant attributes that exist in the website. Various solutions have been developed to mitigate phishing attacks. Yet, there is no solution that was able to solve the problem completely. One of the encouraging methods that can be utilized is the data mining. Specifically, the induction of classification rules. In this article, a novel association classification algorithm is suggested and applied to the well-known phishing websites dataset in the UCI repository. The experimental results were promising with respect to several evaluation criteria that are commonly utilised in evaluating classification data mining domains.
Research into the established area of ITS is evolving into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), itself a fast-moving research area, fuelled in part by rapid changes in computing and communication technologies. Using pseudonym certificate is a popular way to address privacy issues in IoV. Therefore, the certificate management scheme is considered as a feasible technique to manage system and maintain the lifecycle of certificate. In this paper, we propose an efficient pseudonym certificate management scheme in IoV. The Blockchain concept is introduced to simplify the network structure and distributed maintenance of the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). The proposed scheme embeds part of the certificate revocation functions within the security and privacy applications, aiming to reduce the communication overhead and shorten the processing time cost. Extensive simulations and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme, in which the Blockchain structure costs fewer network resources and gives a more economic solution to against further cybercrime attacks.
The cyber world provides an anonymous environment for criminals to conduct malicious activities such as spamming, sending ransom e-mails, and spreading botnet malware. Often, these activities involve textual communication between a criminal and a victim, or between criminals themselves. The forensic analysis of online textual documents for addressing the anonymity problem called authorship analysis is the focus of most cybercrime investigations. Authorship analysis is the statistical study of linguistic and computational characteristics of the written documents of individuals. This paper is the first work that presents a unified data mining solution to address authorship analysis problems based on the concept of frequent pattern-based writeprint. Extensive experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed solution can precisely capture the writing styles of individuals. Furthermore, the writeprint is effective to identify the author of an anonymous text from a group of suspects and to infer sociolinguistic characteristics of the author. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents the current issues and proposes legal remedies for removing the barriers to gathering cross-border electronic evidence for a more efficient fight against crime and cybercrime. It presents the legal scene in the EU, the efforts related to the implementation of the Directive 2014/41/EU regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters, and the provision of legal procedures for e-evidence collection proposed within the EU proposal for the Directive for orders to preserve and produce evidence related to criminal acts in a territory different from the location of the crime act. The results of the EU LIVE_FOR project intended to raise the awareness and improve the implementation of the Directive 2014/41/EU are presented as well. Finally, the procedures proposed in the new EU regulation for collecting e-evidence are analysed and the expected removal of jurisdictive barriers for a more efficient justice processing of crime acts in an interconnected world assessed.
Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) enables secondary users to borrow unused spectrum from the proprietary users in a dynamic and opportunistic manner. However, dynamic and open access nature of available spectrum brings a serious challenge of sustenance amongst CRNs which makes them vulnerable to various spectrum etiquette attacks. Jamming-based denial of service (DoS) attack poses serious threats to legitimate communications and packet delivery. A rational attacker targets certain transmission characteristics to find the highest impacting communication of CRN and causes maximum disruption. In this paper, inspired by the honeypot concept in cybercrime, we propose a honeynet based defense mechanism, which aims to deter the attacker from jamming legitimate communications. The honeynet passively learns the attacker's strategy from the past history of attacks and actively adapts preemptive decoy mechanisms to prevent attacks on legitimate communications. Simulation results show that the with help of honeynet mechanism, CRN successfully avoids jamming attacks and thereby improves system performance in terms of packet delivery ratio.
This chapter critically analyzes the academic literature on cyberterrorism produced between 1996 and 2009. It begins by detailing the origins of the concept and follows up with a brief overview of the cyberterrorism literature produced to date. The remainder of the chapter is divided into five major sections. The first of these is concerned with the definitional debates surrounding cyberterrorism, particularly the question of whether disruption of data is too minimal, given the necessary motivational factors are present, to be classed as cyberterrorism and destruction is necessary. The second and third sections are devoted to untangling cyberterrorism from hacking and cyberterrorism from cybercrime, respectively. Section four is focused upon strategies for separating the cyberterrorism hype from the reality, while section five departs from the cyberterrorism literature to draw attention to an argument from the terrorism as communication approach that, although it dismisses cyberterrorism as an imminent threat and thus bears similarities to much of the literature discussed in this chapter, introduces a new and different rationale for same.
Players who are targets of potential raids can sometimes preempt some of these raids and neutralize the raiders. These threatened players have different values to the attackers as raid targets, and they act independently of each other and sometimes sequentially. The order in which the threatened players make their neutralization decisions turns out to be critical to the number of raids and the resulting probability of being attacked. The lowest number of raids results when the threatened players act in ascending order of attractiveness as targets for preemptive strikes. The analysis characterizes game-theoretic equilibrium as a function of action sequencing. It also discusses variations in the game situation, such as if the same threatened player can make multiple preemptive strikes, or if threatened players all act simultaneously rather than in a sequential order. The results are relevant in many contexts, including cybercrime, military threats from revisionist states, international terrorism, sabotage among employees in firms and other organizations, and defense of corporations against hostile takeover attempts.
This paper deals with a cybergrooming and sexual misconduct topic in artificial intelligence-based educational programs. Although cybergrooming has been recognized as a cybercrime, there is a lack of programs to protect youth from cybergrooming. We present a generative chatbot framework, SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate fluent authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot. Furthermore, we propose deep-reinforcement-learning-based dialogue generation with a stage-related reward to lead the conversation to the expected stage. We also minimize potential ethical issues introduced by the perverted languages when deploying the chatbots for cybersecurity education programs. We evaluated the conversations of SERI with open-source referenced, unreferenced metrics and human evaluation. We developed SERI as a platform for deploying perpetrator chatbot to interact with youth users to observe their responses and collect reactions when they are asked for private or sensitive information by the perpetrator.
The insurance as governance literature focuses on the ability of private enterprises to collectively regulate, pool, and distribute risks. This paper analyzes how governments support insurance markets to maintain insurability and limit risks to society. We propose a new conceptual framework grouping government interventions into three dimensions: regulation of risky activity, public investment in risk reduction, and co-insurance. We apply this framework to six case studies, describing insurance markets' reliance on public support in more analytically precise terms. We analyze how mature insurance markets overcame insurability challenges akin to those currently presented by extortive cybercrime. Private governance struggled when markets grew too big for informal coordination or when (tail) risks escalated. Government interventions vary widely. Some governments prioritize supporting economic activity while others concentrate on containing risks. Governments also choose between risk reduction and ex post socialization of losses. We apply these insights to the market for ransomware insurance, discussing the merits and potential hazards of current proposals for government intervention.
One of the most pressing challenges with policing online fraud relates to jurisdiction. Policing is traditionally based on territoriality, but the internet has changed this. Offenders in one country can target a victim in a second country, who is requested to send money to a third or fourth country. This article examines online fraud victims' reporting to police. Specifically, it demonstrates the misconceptions that exist regarding jurisdiction, namely the relationship between the Australian Federal Police and state/territory police. A clear disconnect emerges between understandings and expectations of who can investigate what relating to online fraud. The Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network's establishment in 2014 is a positive step but this has not fixed the issue entirely. Overall, the article argues that the jurisdictional challenges experienced by police are not understood by victims, and improvement is needed regarding awareness of victims and police alike, to reduce unnecessary, additional trauma to victims.
The explosive growth of computer technologies creates many electronic data and produces much digital evidence of people's lives. As technology has improved, the volume of data for cybercrime investigation keeps growing at unprecedented rates and creating a quandary for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). This study discusses the rise of digital evidence and the triage needs in digital forensic processing. It requires the sincere examination of all available data volumes at the scene or in the lab to present digital evidence in a court of law. In order to maintain the relevance, reliability, and sufficiency of digital evidence, investigators must establish a process model that can provide a quick response at the scene. This study proposes the novel triage triangle strategy of digital forensic components and illustrates TEAR phases from the viewpoint of THOR dimensions to describe the proper practices for identifying, collecting, acquiring, and preserving the digital data. It facilitates the efficiency and effectiveness of reducing digital forensic backlogs for LEAs.
The Internet has resulted in cyber-threats and cyber-crimes, which can occur anywhere at any time. Among various cyber threats, modern malware with applied metamorphosis and polymorphic technology is a concern as it can proliferate to advanced variants from its original shape. The typical malware analysis methods, including signature-based approach, remain vulnerable to such advanced variants. This paper proposes a visualization-based approach for malware analysis using the state-of-the-art Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model such as ResNeXt, which had achieved outstanding performance in image classifications with competitive computational complexity. The proposed method transforms the attributes of raw malware binary executable files to greyscale images for further analysis by well-established deep learning models. The greyscale images, which result of data transformation for visualization, are classified using ResNeXt. The experiment results show that the proposed solution achieves 98.32% and 98.86% of accuracy in malware classification on Malimg dataset and modified Malimg dataset, respectively. The proposed method outperforms other comparable methods in terms of classification accuracy and requires similar level of computational power.
Online crime has increased in severity and frequency over the past two decades. However, although several scientific disciplines have commonly employed criminological theories to explain this phenomenon, mainstream criminology has devoted relatively scant attention to the investigation of cyber-criminals and their victims. Drawing on this assumption that more criminological attention should be given to this important type of crime, this article presents an interdisciplinary review of the current state of research on cyber-dependent crimes (i.e., crimes that require the use of computer technology to exist, such as hacking). We begin with a brief discussion of the ecosystem of cyber-dependent crimes and the key actors who operate within it, including the online offenders and enablers, targets and victims, and guardians. Next, we review empirical scholarship that pertains to each actor while distinguishing between nontheoretical research and theoretically driven studies. We then detail methodological and theoretical avenues that should be pursued by future research and discuss why criminological research should lead policy initiatives and guide the design of technical tools that improve the scientific community's ability to generate a safer and more secure cyber-environment. We conclude by discussing potential ways in which cyber-dependent crime research could pave the way for the advancement of mainstream criminological theory and research.
The explosive growth of smart objects and their dependency on wireless technologies for communication increases the vulnerability of Internet of Things (IoT) to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks faced by IoT present daunting challenges to digital forensic experts. Researchers adopt various forensic techniques to investigate such attacks. These techniques aim to track internal and external attacks by emphasizing on communication mechanisms and loT's architectural vulnerabilities. In this study, we explore loT's novel factors affecting traditional computer forensics. We investigate recent studies on loT forensics by analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. We categorize and classify the literature by devising a taxonomy based on forensics phases, enablers, networks, sources of evidence, investigation modes, forensics models, forensics layers, forensics tools, and forensics data processing. We also enumerate a few prominent use cases of loT forensics and present the key requirements for enabling loT forensics. Finally, we identify and discuss several indispensable open research challenges as future research directions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
"Background: People with acquired brain injury (ABI) may be more susceptible to scams owing to postinjury cognitive and psychosocial consequences. Cyberscams result in financial loss and debilitating psychological impacts such as shame and mistrust, interference with neurorehabilitation, and reduced independence. Despite these significant consequences, there are no psychological treatments to support cyberscam survivors. There is limited evidence regarding how the current workforce is addressing post-ABI cyberscams. Objective: This study aims to understand the perspectives and needs of clinicians and service providers in addressing post-ABI cyberscams. Methods: Overall, 20 multidisciplinary clinicians and service providers were recruited through purposive sampling across Australia. Semistructured interviews explored post-ABI scam experiences and vulnerabilities, treatments and their efficacy, and recommendations for future cybersafety recovery interventions. Reflexive thematic analysis was used. Results: In total, 8 themes encompassing a biopsychosocial understanding of scam vulnerabilities and impacts were identified: genuine lack of awareness: cognitive -executive difficulties; not coping with the loss of it all; needing trust and connection; strong reactions of trusted others; nothing structured to do; financial stress and independence; cyberability; and scammer persuasion. Each theme informed clinical recommendations including the need to provide psychological and cognitive support, enhance financial and cybersafety skills, promote meaningful social engagement, and foster collaboration between families and clinical support teams. Conclusions: The multifaceted range of scam vulnerabilities and impacts highlighted the need for individualized, comprehensive, and targeted treatments using a biopsychosocial approach to enable cyberscam recovery among people with ABI. These findings will guide the development of a co -designed intervention. (J Med Internet Res 2024;26:e51245) doi: 10.2196/51245"
The aim of this review is to summarize the available empirical research on parental production and to explore the discursive positioning of parental perpetrators within scholarship on child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Academic databases were searched using a combination of relevant terms, and the review was expanded as new terms were identified. The review identified 66 scholarly articles, papers, or books that referred to parental production of CSAM published since 1970. To explore how parental offenders have been positioned within this literature over time, the review is presented according to a chronological summary, drawing out key themes and empirical insights. The review showed that parental CSAM production is common, more likely to involve pre-pubescent victims, more severe abuse, female as well as male perpetrators, and produces high-demand illegal content with serious long-term sequelae. However, the review found that the focus of child trafficking and sexual exploitation scholarship on commercial and profit-driven abuse has marginalized and obscured parental CSAM production as a serious policy challenge. These findings warrant a reorientation of research, policy, and practice approaches to technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation, as well as a reflection on the resistance of researchers and policymakers to acknowledging the problem of family-based sexual exploitation.
Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are a keystone predator of savanna systems in Africa, yet their populations have dramatically declined due to pressures such as human-wildlife conflict, loss of habitat, and most notably the illegal trade in live cheetah cubs as pets. We provide the most extensive dataset relevant to seized and non-intercepted illegal trade in live cheetahs and cheetah parts for the decade 2010-2019, spanning over 300 sources and 56 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America. It includes 1,884 individual incidents involving at least 4,000 cheetahs or cheetah parts or products likely or confirmed to breach national laws or CITES regulations. While the covert nature of illegal trade of any kind makes it extremely difficult to capture its true volume, we believe that the information contained in this dataset demonstrates the need for a more indepth look into illegal cheetah trade, including sustainability assessments with emphasis in regions where cheetah populations are small and widely exploited, such as the Horn of Africa, as this dataset suggests. Ultimately, such actions could lead to improved enforcement and legal frameworks, and provide a guide for CITES actions involving international cooperation and demand reduction efforts.

People tend to disclose personal identifiable information (PII) that could be used by cybercriminals against them. Often persuasion techniques are used by cybercriminals to trick people to disclose PII. This research investigates whether people can be made less susceptible to persuasion by reciprocation (i.e., making people feel obligated to return a favor) and authority, particularly in regard to whether information security knowledge and positive affect moderate the relation between susceptibility to persuasion and disclosing PII. Data are used from a population-based survey experiment that measured the actual disclosure of PII in an experimental setting (N = 2426). The results demonstrate a persuasion-disclosure link, indicating that people disclose more PII when persuaded by reciprocation, but not by authority. Knowledge of information security was also found to relate to disclosure. People disclosed less PII when they possessed more knowledge of information security. Positive affect was not related to the disclosure of PII. And contrary to expectations, no moderating effects were found of information security knowledge nor positive affect on the persuasion-disclosure link. Possible explanations are discussed, as well as limitations and future research directions.
With continual advances in Internet capability, in addition to its global and decentralized nature, the Internet along with different social networking sites are experiencing a boom in demand and supply. Recent study found that the social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are providing a forum for paedophiles to share child pornography. With the advent of sophisticated digital technology, Law Enforcement Agency (LEAs) around the world dealing with child pornography facing real challenge to combat with the technologically-savvy paedophiles. The major challenge in child pornography lies in authentic detection of children face in an image. The main objective of this research is to present a novel framework for a dedicated child face detection tool, where we will use child's face specific contextual contexts and visual cues that are based on new knowledge in terms of features or contexts representatives of child's skin and face. The proposed technique can estimate age categorically - adult or child based on a new hybrid feature descriptor, called Luminance Invariant & Geometrical Relation based Descriptor (LIGRD). LIGRD is composed of some low and high-level features, which are found to be effective in characterizing the local appearance in terms of chromaticity, texture, and geometric relational information of few facial visual cues simultaneously. Comparison of our experimental results with that of another recently published work reveals our proposed approach yields the highest precision and recall, and overall accuracy in recognition.
"The distinct setting in which cyber-dependent crime takes place may reduce the similarity in the deviance of social network members. We test this assumption by analysing the deviance of the most important social contacts of cyber-dependent offenders and traditional offenders in the Netherlands (N = 344 offenders; N = 1131 social contacts). As expected, similarity in deviance is weaker for cyber-dependent crime. Because this is a strong predictor of traditional offending, this has important implications for criminological research and practice. Additionally, for both crime types the offending behaviour of a person is more strongly linked to the deviance of social ties if those ties are of the same gender and age, and if the offender has daily contact with them. Implications and future criminological research suggestions are discussed."
With the development of information and communication technology, online communication is becoming more active than offline meetings in daily life. This online communication is accelerating, especially as smartphone distribution and utilization become more prevalent. This communication in cyberspace has the advantage of people being able to communicate anytime, anywhere beyond time and place, while causing a variety of inappropriate consequences. A typical one is cyberbullying, which is a serious problem for adolescents who have active communication online. The purpose of this study is to accurately investigate and analyze the status of cyberbullying among adolescents. To this end, national survey data of the National Information Society Agency (NIA) was analyzed for the past three years. The population size and sample size from 2017 to 2019 were 5.773.998 and 4500 (2017), 5,663,725 and 4662 (2018), 5,502,801 and 4779 (2019), respectively. The statistical analysis shows that the biggest type of cyberbullying among adolescents is verbal abuse, and the biggest means is instant messaging. In addition, the most frequent forms of cyberbullying victims and cyberbullying perpetrators occur between individuals. In addition, the correlation between the interpersonal relationships of adolescents and the cyberbullying experience rate were analyzed, and various cyberbullying factors such as psychological factors were analyzed. As a result, we found that the interaction with parents and friendship reliability have a negative correlation with the cyberbullying experience rate. We expect the results of this study to be of great help to future research and policies of juvenile cyberbullying.
The exponential increase on the internet of indecent images of children (IIOC) has been followed by a transformation within criminal justice. The scale, nature and rapid technological evolution of such crimes-often of distant initial geographical origin-requires collaborative justice and harm reduction arrangements with internet companies and NGOs. The diminished reach (declining criminal justice interventions) and power (even in identifying crimes for intervention) of state authority with the current collaborative model, however, has resulted in inadequate social regulation and policing in response to IIOC crimes on the surface web. There is a considerable risk that the Online Harms White Paper proposals to establish overarching government authority to generally reduce harmful conduct will not fully resolve problems that go much wider than the technological, commercial and consumer protection on the surface web issues emphasised in that document. Only political choices about funding and fundamental rights compliant legislation can (a) prevent the hollowing out of criminal justice capacity and capabilities to deal with IIOC offenders and (b) ensure an essential compatibility and consistency in police operational ability-including the access sought to anonymised communication data via an encryption key-and legal principles when dealing with IIOC crimes across all levels of the internet, including `the dark web'. These issues are examined as a case study in civic epistemology about the influence of neoliberalism in technologically focused policy making.
Phishing is a kind of cybercrime that uses disguised websites to trick people into providing personally sensitive information. Phishing detection with high accuracy has attracted enormous interest in Cyber Security. Many website-based features have been applied for phishing detection, however, useless features can lead to extra feature extraction and phishing detection time costs. This paper analyzes 111 features of the latest published phishing websites dataset to investigate the obvious differences and correlations between phishing and legitimate websites. By applying eleven commonly used Machine Learning algorithms and evaluating their performances, we choose Random Forest as our phishing detection algorithm. Based on feature importance methods, we proposed a framework to reduce the number of features while maintaining high detection accuracy. The model training time and the usage of memory can also be saved. With the combination of the proposed feature selection framework, the important findings indicate that by using only 14 features, the accuracy of phishing detection can achieve 97.0%.
this study focuses on the spatial context of hacking to networks of Honey-pots. We investigate the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of victimized computers and system trespassers. We've deployed research Honeypots on the computer networks of two academic institutions, collected information on successful brute force attacks (BFA) and system trespassing events (sessions), and used Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques, to depict and understand the correlation between spatial attributes (IP addresses) and hacking networks' topology. We mapped and explored hacking patterns and found that geography might set the behavior of the attackers as well as the topology of hacking networks. The contribution of this study stems from the fact that there are no prior studies of geographical influences on the topology of hacking networks and from the unique usage of SNA to investigate hacking activities. Looking ahead, our study can assist policymakers in forming effective policies in the field of cybercrime.
e-mail scams have been around for a long time, and they are still remarkably successful. Understanding these scams can help combat fraud by raising public awareness and improving anti-fraud technologies. We conducted an in-depth analysis of e-mail contents with a mixed-method approach using machine-learning-based content analysis and qualitative analysis. We identified five stories (i.e., topics) scammers used in their e-mails. Further, we explored similarities between messages from the same scammers. Our findings suggest some scammers resend a message with the same story as before but with highly textual differences. We argue this might be a deceptive maneuver to avoid spam blockers.
Over the past few years, the agenda-topping issue of human trafficking is increasingly bracketed with the use of digital technologies. Though the trafficking-technology nexus is a growing area of public and policy concern, as far as empirical research is concerned, the subject is still a relatively open field. As a result, quite a few unknowns regarding the interaction between technological developments and trafficking in persons remain unresolved. In this context, the present research paper principally aims to build on the existent body of literature in order to broaden our comprehension of the matter at hand. Based on a systematic literature review and interviews with convicted offenders as well as anti-trafficking practitioners in Belgium, this paper presents an overview of the various ways in which technology can be leveraged both in the perpetration and the counteraction of human trafficking activities. In addition, the question of how technology relates to the traditional workings of trafficking is considered from a cyber-criminological point of view. That is, a connection is drawn between the use of technological tools by human traffickers and our current understanding of the business of trafficking in persons.
Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak and offering COVID-19-related scams to unsuspecting people. Currently, there is a lack of studies that focus on protecting people from COVID-19-related cybercrimes. Drawing upon Cultivation Theory and Protection Motivation Theory, we develop a research model to examine the cultivation effect of government social media on peoples? information security behavior towards COVID-19 scams. We employ structural equation modeling to analyze 240 survey responses collected from social media followers of government accounts. Our results suggest that government social media account followers? participation influences their information security behavior through perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, and response efficacy. Our study highlights the importance of government social media for information security management during crises.
Exploitable vulnerabilities in software are one of the root causes of cybercrime, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and wider security breaches for both enterprise and consumers. Furthermore, checking for vulnerabilities in software is no longer a human-scale problem due to code volume and complexity. To help address this problem, our work presents a deep learning model able to identify risk signals in Java source code and output a classification for a program as either vulnerable or safe. Sequences of raw Java opcodes are used to train a convolutional neural network that automatically encapsulates discriminative characteristics of a program that are then used for the prediction. Compared to traditional machine learning methods, this approach requires no prior knowledge of the software vulnerability domain, nor any hand-crafted input features. When evaluated on the publicly available benchmark dataset Juliet Test Suite containing 38520 vulnerable and 38806 safe programs, our method achieves an F1 score of 0.92.
Purpose This paper aims to study the developed countries' experience on the cyberbullying legal regulation among adolescents, to identify existing shortcomings in the developing countries' laws and to develop recommendations for regulatory framework improvement. Design/methodology/approach The authors have studied the state regulatory practice of the UK, the USA, Canada, Malaysia, South Africa, Turkey, UAE and analyzed the statistics of 2018 on the cyberbullying manifestation among adolescents in these countries. Findings The study results can encourage countries to create separate cyberbullying legislation and periodically review and modify already existing legislation. Originality/value The study provides a list of the recommendations to regulate cybercrime in developing countries and prevent it as well. The results may contribute to creating laws related to the regulation of cyberbullying in countries where such legislation does not exist yet or existing regulatory legal acts do not bring the expected results, namely, in Post-Soviet countries and other developing countries of the world.
Detecting malicious software or malware is one of the major concerns in information security governance as malware authors pose a major challenge to digital forensics by using a variety of highly sophisticated stealth techniques to hide malicious code in computing systems, including smartphones. The current detection techniques are futile, as forensic analysis of infected devices is unable to identify all the hidden malware, thereby resulting in zero day attacks. This chapter takes a key step forward to address this issue and lays foundation for deeper investigations in digital forensics. The goal of this chapter is, firstly, to unearth the recent obfuscation strategies employed to hide malware. Secondly, this chapter proposes innovative techniques that are implemented as a fully-automated tool, and experimentally tested to exhaustively detect hidden malware that leverage on system vulnerabilities. Based on these research investigations, the chapter also arrives at an information security governance plan that would aid in addressing the current and future cybercrime situations.
There is comparatively little information about the roles and the separation of these roles within financially-motivated cybercrime online. As Darknet Markets (DNMs) are online fora, roles can often be conflated with membership or user types within such fora, e.g., administrator, new user, etc. The insights presented in this paper are grounded in a Conversation Analysis of underground forum threads in combination with Social Network Analysis of the relationships between actors in these fora and an automated analysis of the thematic scope of their communications using NLP techniques. This results in a more nuanced understanding of roles, and the power relationships between roles, as they emerge through and are defined by linguistic interactions. Based on this mixed methods approach, we developed a dynamic typology of three key roles within DNMs that goes beyond a basic supply-demand logic: entrepreneurs, influencers and gatekeepers. A closer analysis of these roles can contribute to a better understanding of emerging trends in a forum and allow for the identification and prioritisation of high-risk targets.
New and nontraditional approaches are required to effectively tackle the global problem of cybercrime. Online warning messages offer the unique potential to influence information behavior at the exact point of user decision-making. This research assessed the prevention effect of differing components of warning messages. Thirty-five male participants, aged 18-43, participated in a behavioral-compliance task comprising messages received when visiting websites likely to contain malware. Participants also rated messages on believability, severity, and effects on intention to comply. The components of messages tested were as follows: three signal words (warning, hazard, and stop), two levels of message explicitness (high, low), and two imagery conditions (eyes, no eyes). Contrary to expectations, explicitness was the only message component to yield a significant preventative effect on self-rated and behavioral responses. Participants not only perceived the explicit messages as more believable, severe, and likely to increase intention to comply but also demonstrated, through their behavioral-compliance data, a preventative effect from more explicit messages. The implications of these findings for designing messages to prevent cybercrimes are explored.
New innovations in computer systems were created aiming to provide convenience for its users, but unfortunately they are often followed by threats that surround them. The Company's computer security system can not control the security of every company data. Because information technology attacks have impact on consumer information management and corporate marketing activities, it is necessary to have an institution or business supervisory body for mining company to deal with corporate cybercrime. Data collection uses some methods including observation and document analysis. The data sources used are primary, secondary and tertiary. There are four stages of data analysis, namely data collection, processing, verification, and conclusions. The results indicated that data security of mining companies is critically required to protect company assets such as natural and human resources from the threats of internet criminals. The role of Indonesian National Cyber Bureau is to prevent the occurrence of crimes on the internet through the cycle of supervision formining business, and mining companies should have a robust computer software system.
Today we live in a time where everything is digitalized and technology moves rapidly forward. This big technology progress is closely linked to increase of cybercrime. In an effort to fight e-crime and to collect relevant digital evidence, law enforcement agencies are incorporating the collection and analysis of digital evidence, also known as computer forensics, into their infrastructure. They are challenged by the need to train officers and specialists to collect digital evidence and keep up with rapidly evolving technologies such as computer operating systems and mobile devices. With a lack of resources to send new people to the trainings, very often recently trained officers and experts become trainers to their colleagues. This role demands specific competencies and skills that can be learned on specialized courses. Based on an empirical analysis done on specimen of 20 experienced digital forensic specialists, this paper shows results of this research, offers explanation of competencies and skills needed for digital forensic trainer and helps law enforcement agencies to recognize potential trainers in their ranks, and helps them in their fight with the e-crime.
With the global diffusion of cybercrime, the ever-growing market penetration of high-performance and low-cost personal digital devices, and the commercial success of cloud computing, the area of digital forensics is faced with various new challenges that must be taken seriously. In this chapter, the authors describe a novel approach to digital investigations based on the emerging Forensics as a Service (FaaS) model. This model attempts to optimize Law Enforcement Agency's (LEA) forensic procedures, reduce complexity, and save operational costs. Inspired by previous work on distributed computing for forensic analysis, this chapter provides the reader with design guidelines of a FaaS platform for secure service delivery. The proposed FaaS platform should be able to support investigators and practitioners in their daily tasks (e.g. digital evidence examination, analysis, and reporting) once implemented by a cloud forensic provider or internally by a LEA. In this chapter, the authors also present the architecture components, interfaces, communication protocols, functional and non-functional requirements, as well as security specifications of the proposed framework in detail.
According to a study by Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is expected to cost $6 trillion annually by 2021. Most cybersecurity threats access internal networks through infected endpoints. Recently, various endpoint environments such as smartphones, tablets, and Internet of things (IoT) devices have been configured, and security issues caused by malware targeting them are intensifying. Event logs-based detection technology for endpoint security is detected using rules or patterns. Therefore, known attacks can respond, but unknown attacks can be difficult to respond to immediately. To solve this problem, in this paper, local outlier factor (LOF) and Autoencoder detect suspicious behavior that deviates from normal behavior. It also detects threats and shows the corresponding threats when suspicious events corresponding to the rules created through the attack profile are constantly occurring. Experimental results detected eight new suspicious processes that were not previously detected, and four malicious processes and one suspicious process were judged using Hybrid Analysis and VirusTotal. Based on the experiment results, it is expected that the use of operational policies such as allowlists in the proposed model will significantly improve performance by minimizing false positives.
With technological advancements and the increasing use of computers and internet in our day to day lives, the issue of security has become paramount. The rate of cybercrime has increased tremendously in the internet era. Out of the numerous crimes. identity theft is perhaps the one that poses the most dangers to an individual. More and more voices strongly declare that the password is no longer a reliable IT security measure and must be replaced by more efficient systems for protecting the computer contents. Behavioural biometrics is an emerging technology that resoles some of the major flaws of the previous scheme. We first present an overview of behavioural biometrics, followed by a comprehensive literature survey of techniques. Then, we propose a novel system for authentication which uses the concept of a logical DNA integrating multiple factors to build a user profile. This model is known as 'BehavioAttlh'. The new model demonstrates an accuracy of 96% with FAR and FRR being negligible (3% and 3.3% respectively). Finally, we compare the new model with the currently existing mechanisms.
Robocalling, voice phishing, and caller ID spoofing are common cybercrime techniques used to launch scam campaigns through the telephony channel, which unsuspecting users have long trusted. More reliable than online complaints, a telephony honeypot provides complete, accurate and timely information about unwanted phone calls across the United States. Our first goal is to provide a large-scale data-driven analysis of the telephony spam and fraud ecosystem. Our second goal is to uniquely identify bad actors potentially operating several phone numbers. We collected about 40,000 unsolicited calls. Our results show that only a few bad actors, robocallers or telemarketers, are responsible for the majority of the spam and scam calls, and that they can be uniquely identified based on audio features from their calls. This discovery has major implications for law enforcement and businesses that are presently engaged in combatting the rise of telephony fraud. In particular, since our system allows end-users to detect fraudulent behavior and tie it back to existing fraud and spam campaigns, it can be used as the first step towards designing and deploying intelligent defense strategies.
Digital evidences hold great significance for governing cybercrime. Unfortunately, previous acquisition tools were troubled by either the shortage of suspending the target system's running or the security of the acquisition tools themselves, thus the correctness and accuracy of their obtained evidences cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose VAIL, a novel virtualization based monitoring system for mini-intrusive live forensics, which employs hardware assisted virtualization technique to gather integrated information from the native computer system. Meanwhile, the execution of the target system will not be interrupted and VAIL keeps immune to attacks from the target system. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that has been validated with a Windows guest system. The experimental results show that VAIL can obtain comprehensive digital evidences from the target system as designed, including the CPU state, the physical memory content, and the I/O activities. And on average, VAIL only introduces 4.21 % performance overhead to the target system, which proves that VAIL is practical in real commercial environments.
The development of the Internet and computer-mediated communications (CMC), such as email and instant messaging, has transformed the lives of young people. The ability to communicate in near real time with others provides beneficial social impact, though it has also created unique opportunities for victimization. Research has focused on certain forms of sexual activity online, such as sexting, but little study has been devoted to coercion to engage in sexual conversations as a form of sexual harassment. This study examined this phenomenon in a sample of middle and high school youth in Kentucky, applying an integrated low self-control and routine activity framework. The findings demonstrated that youth who were victimized were more likely to have low levels of self-control, view pornography, have peers who engaged others in sexual conversation online, and be female. The relationship between gender and victimization was examined in depth, along with the implications of this study for our understanding of the utility of routine activity theory and the general theory of crime.
Information technology is becoming increasingly important for entrepreneurs. Protecting their technical infrastructure and stored data is, therefore, also becoming more vital. Nevertheless, research into the safety and security of entrepreneurs in general, and online threats targeted at entrepreneurs in particular, is still limited. This study investigates to what extent self-employed entrepreneurs protect themselves against online threats, and what motivates them to do so. Based on secondary analyses on data collected from 1622 Dutch entrepreneurs, we observe that the majority implement technical and personal coping measures. By adopting protection motivation theory as a theoretical basis for our study, we found that coping appraisal explains the adoption of protective measures. Entrepreneurs are likely to implement protective measures when they believe a measure is effective, when they are capable of using internet technology, when their attitude towards online protection is positive and when they believe they are responsible for their own online security. Although the secondary analysis provides some limitations, this study offers new insights into the usage of protective measures and the motivation for taking them. These insights can help to improve information security campaigns.
IntroductionFew studies have examined the sales of stolen account credentials on darkweb markets. In this study, we tested how advertisement characteristics affect the popularity of illicit online advertisements offering account credentials. Unlike previous criminological research, we take a novel approach by assessing the applicability of knowledge on regular consumer behaviours instead of theories explaining offender behaviour.MethodsWe scraped 1,565 unique advertisements offering credentials on a darkweb market. We used this panel data set to predict the simultaneous effects of the asking price, endorsement cues and title elements on advertisement popularity by estimating several hybrid panel data models.ResultsMost of our findings disconfirm our hypotheses. Asking price did not affect advertisement popularity. Endorsement cues, including vendor reputation and cumulative sales and views, had mixed and negative relationships, respectively, with advertisement popularity.DiscussionOur results might suggest that account credentials are not simply regular products, but high-risk commodities that, paradoxically, become less attractive as they gain popularity. This study highlights the necessity of a deeper understanding of illicit online market dynamics to improve theories on illicit consumer behaviours and assist cybersecurity experts in disrupting criminal business models more effectively. We propose several avenues for future experimental research to gain further insights into these illicit processes.
Although geographic information systems (GIS) are popular tools for investigations and resource deployment/management within law enforcement agencies, the utility of software programs like Esri's ArcGIS mapping software to identify vulnerable areas or populations to prevent or mitigate the impact of crime is rarely explored within the field. What is even less explored is how online information can be leveraged and mapped to inform practitioners of areas where harm reduction strategies could be deployed. Recognizing this gap in the literature, this investigation explored whether publicly available online chatter by established and potential customers of sex workers could point to areas of targeted outreach before harm occurs. Ultimately, we found that online chatter about accessing sex workers can be mapped to identify vulnerable areas and people. While this study was exploratory and others should build on this idea, this study demonstrated GIS could aid in the prevention of crime by leveraging online information to highlight areas and people at risk for harm.
Statistical methods are essential for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method research methodology. Mostly, statistical methods involve mathematical formulas, models, and techniques used in analyzing data. Each method and statistical analysis used brings different results to a study. Therefore, this study aims to explore the use of statistical methods in the ICT ethics area. This study reviews the research done on ICT ethics for the years 2015 until 2020. The research questions addressed in this study are: (i) What statistical methods were used in the ICT ethics research? and (ii) What application area in ICT ethics employ the statistical methods? The findings indicated that the inferential statistical method was most employed, followed by the descriptive statistical method and other methods. Also, non-parametric was the most technique used compared to parametric. Meanwhile, the application area in ICT ethics that employ statistical methods is privacy, piracy, access right, cybercrime, harmful action, social impact, and other related ethics issues such as hacking, internet addiction, free speech, and cyberloafing. The implication of the study is described.
Phishing is a kind of worldwide spread cybercrime that uses disguised websites to trick users into downloading malware or providing personally sensitive information to attackers. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, more and more researchers in the cybersecurity field utilize machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify phishing websites. In order to compare the performances of various machine learning and deep learning methods, several experiments are conducted in this study. According to the experimental results, ensemble machine learning algorithms stand out among other candidates in both detection accuracy and computational consumption. Furthermore, the ensemble architectures still provide impressive capability when the amount of features decreases sharply in the dataset. Subsequently, the paper discusses the factors why ensemble machine learning methods are more suitable for the binary phishing classification challenge in up-date training and real-time detecting environment, which reflects the sufficiency of ensemble machine learning methods in anti-phishing techniques.
This paper presents a systematic approach to designing a series of digital forensics instructional materials to address the severe shortage of active learning materials in the digital forensics community. The materials include real-world scenariobased case studies, a set of hands-on problem-driven labs for each case study, and an integrated forensic investigation environment. In this paper, we first clarify some fundamental concepts related to digital forensics, such as digital forensic artifacts, artifact generators, and evidence. We then re-categorize knowledge units of digital forensics based on the artifact generators for measuring the coverage of learning outcomes and topics. Finally, we utilize a real-world cybercrime scenario to demonstrate how knowledge units, digital forensics topics, concepts, artifacts, and investigation tools can be infused into each lab through active learning. The repository of the instructional materials is publicly available on GitHub. It has gained nearly 600 stars and 22k views within several months.
Prior studies have x-rayed the potentials and impetus for development that can be resultant from a full scale adoption of ICT in Africa particularly in Nigeria. Current challenges relating to infrastructures, cybercrime, government policies and so on that mitigate the benefits accruable from a virile ICT growth have also been highlighted. However, research also needs to really address possible areas of developmental benefit of ICT to rural target groups such as farmers, extension officers, health and social workers This paper explores possible alignment of ICT4D2.0 goals to ICT development in Nigeria. It posited that the digital divide that ICTD1.0 sets to bridge are still very evident at grassroots level. Adding computing and Internet functionality to technologies that already penetrate the grassroots such as mobiles phones, radios and televisions will enhance ICT4D2.0 goals in Nigeria. This will in turn increase productivity among this target group with attendant contribution to national development.
As most software used by government agencies and companies is proprietary, malicious computer activity targeting breaches in that software can be likened to a pandemic of an infectious disease in the cyber world. When a breach occurs, the consequences can be widespread and damaging because the damage can spread rapidly. Therefore, cybercrime prevention needs to involve all users in a cooperative effort, with warnings and information on countermeasures distributed to users in order to prevent the disease from spreading when unprotected computers encounter an attack. This cooperative effort relies heavily on all institutions reporting information security incidents. Based on institutional theory, together with regulatory pluralism and responsive regulation theory, this paper examines the pluralized regulatory approach adopted to promote a system for sharing reports of information security incidents in Taiwan and China. An expanded model of regulatory enforcement and a strengths-based pyramid are proposed and used as a framework for discussing existing systems for encouraging the reporting of information security incidents.
"The Article looks into recovering assets for victims of frauds using the financial system to launder proceeds, against the backdrop of two case-examples and the lessons learned by the authors from their practice as lawyers in Portugal. It sets out relevant EU instruments (Section I) and then turns into the main difficulties and obstacles in practice (Section II). Finally, it addresses the use of preventive suspension of banking operations (SOB) under AML laws at the service of the interests of the victims of cross-border fraud. It argues albeit these have not been built or designed bearing victims' interests in mind they are essential to the recovery of the proceeds and their return to fraud victims. The authors propose to reflect on improving such mechanisms, namely by guaranteeing that it is possible to make consecutive blockings that follow the trail of the proceeds of the fraud through the various jurisdictions involved; and also on the pertinence of giving an explicit place to the victim in the legal framework that regulates the mechanisms for the prevention of money laundering, namely by facilitating the access of the victims to reporting channels that allow for a quick activation of such mechanisms (Section III). The piece concludes stating that although multiple mechanisms are available to ensure the protection of victims' financial interests in this context, the articulation and definition of the strategy is highly complex, making the intervention of a lawyer essential. In any event, if there is no swift intervention and freezing of the proceeds at the outset of the detection of fraud, it is as a rule impossible to recover victims' assets. It is ironic that in practice such freezing is at best made possible by AML laws that were not designed having victims' interests at the forefront."
"The paper emphasizes that the digitalization of the modern world, the development of information technology, the spread of the Internet, computer networks, and the use of cyberspace have facilitated the daily life of society. However, these factors have entailed a threat to the security and confidentiality of information, personal data, and the financial system. The authors state that financial fraud is becoming an increasingly severe global problem since criminals use the financial ecosystem for money laundering and illegal financial transactions. The study's primary purpose is to identify the latest trends in the financial crime of the world. The methodological tools of the research consisted of theoretical research methods (grouping, abstraction), empirical research methods (observation, description), and the resource base of the information platform, bibliometric analysis, and modeling. The following scientific categories were chosen as the objects of study: regulatory and legal aspects of financial crimes, online crimes and cybercrimes, methods and systems of regulation, control, prevention, counteraction, combating financial crime, and modeling of financial crime processes. The paper analyzes the literature sources regarding the shift of the interest of modern financial market scientists to the study of the features of financial crime. The relevance of identifying the latest trends in financial crime lies in the fact that the study of financial crime trends will allow the improving of the awareness of financial fraud, creating common databases, building coalitions, and identifying effective and efficient ways to improve the ability to combat financial crime at a more effective national and global level. At the initial stage of the work, a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications dedicated to the study of the latest trends in financial crime was carried out. As a result, literary works for the study of the specified issue were systematized; a map of relationships between key terms and other scientific concepts was created; a content-contextual and intercluster analysis of the obtained blocks of bibliometric analysis was carried out; a map of the relationships of the studied key concepts with other scientific categories in dynamics was constructed and the contextual-time block was analyzed. The research in this paper is carried out in three parts, which provide for the definition of several research vectors. As a result of research - the authors discuss potential sources and tools of financial fraud with their negative, harmful aspects for identification, in-depth consideration, and study; they identify tools for countering financial crimes; practical models for evaluating, analyzing, identifying, comparing, and visualizing the features of financial crime are described. The conclusion of the study assumes that the results of the study can be practically applied by financial organizations, institutions, and business entities for the future safe functioning of the financial sector but taking into account the need for constant development of IT support for financial transactions as a response to the rapidly changing needs of our time."
6G networks can be truly intelligent wireless systems that have the flexibility for continuous technological improvements. However, security events affecting information systems have grown increasingly complicated and sophisticated. Intruders may be able to operate due to a lack of evidence authenticity. Using network forensics methods can solve many cybercrime instances. These methods can be used to locate the intruder and to determine the intrusion's origin and how it can be avoided in the future. Existing network forensics techniques confront security threats and vulnerabilities in several networks, such as personal area networks, local area networks, wide area networks, and wireless wide area networks under telecom networks, in practice, but cannot operate in 6G and beyond telecom networks, which are critical at this moment. Thus, a comprehensive literature analysis of telecom networks is conducted to identify existing concerns and challenges in conducting digital communication forensics. Hence, a digital forensics system for 6G and beyond networks is proposed as an initial idea on the basis of the highlighted issues, thereby assessing security incidents and providing justified evidence that explains the footprints of the attackers.
A plethora of evidence demonstrates the effects of the digitisation of society on everyday life. Developments in web science (the world wide web), online technologies (internet of things, social media, e-governance), artificial intelligence and robotics present major challenges for contemporary societies. These technological advances create risks (loss of autonomy, cybercrime, online abuse, threats to children's safety and national security) and opportunities (climate change mitigation, responses to global health scourges, medical therapies, intergenerational connectivity, smart cities). This article focusses on the contribution of the social sciences to the digital revolution, whether it be in the public or private sectors, civil society or households. The authors explore how technological innovations can result from international cooperation between researchers in different disciplines. They consider how evidence from the social sciences is used to measure the societal impacts of technological change in different cultural, economic and political contexts. They review the ethical issues raised by the datafication of society and autonomous learning machines, while assessing the contribution of social sciences to the policymaking process in the digital age.
There is an increasing demand for expert analysis of cybercriminal communities. Cybercrime is continually becoming more complex due to the rapid development of digital technologies, on the one hand, in new types of criminal activity, such as hacking, distributing malware and DDoS attacks, and on the other hand, in digitised forms of more traditional crimes, such as email scams, phishing, identity theft, and cryptographically secured black markets. Tackling this broad array of behaviour requires tool support for multi-disciplinary investigations, and a connecting framework that can adjust flexibly to changes in the populations being studied. In this work, we present AMoC, a multi-faceted machine learning toolkit that combines structured queries, anomaly detection, social network analysis, topic modelling and accounts recognition to enable comprehensive analysis of cybercriminal communities and users. The toolkit enables the extraction of findings regarding the motivations, behaviour and characteristics of offenders, and how cybercriminal communities react to interventions such as arrests and take-downs. In our demonstration, the toolkit is deployed to analyse over 150,000 accounts from 35 underground marketplaces.
Cybergrooming is a serious cybercrime that primarily targets youths through online platforms. Although reactive predator detection methods have been studied, proactive victim protection and crime prevention can also be achieved through vulnerability analysis of potential youth victims. Despite its significance, vulnerability analysis has not been thoroughly studied in the data science literature, while several social science studies used survey-based methods. To address this gap, we investigate humans' social-psychological traits and quantify key vulnerability factors to cybergrooming by analyzing text features in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Through pairwise correlation studies, we demonstrate the degrees of key vulnerability dimensions to cybergrooming from youths' conversational features. Our findings reveal that victims have negative correlations with family and community traits, contrasting with previous social survey studies that indicated family relationships or social support as key vulnerability factors. We discuss the current limitations of text mining analysis and suggest cross-validation methods to increase the validity of research findings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into understanding the vulnerability factors to cybergrooming and highlights the importance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches.
The world is facing a new era of criminal activities in cyber space, which are being committed across the world, irrespective of geographical boundaries. These cybercrime acts may be financially driven acts, related to computer content, or against the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of computer systems. The relative risk and threat differs between governments and businesses. The level of criminal organization represents a defining feature of the human association element behind criminal conduct. India accounts for close to $8bn of the total $110bn cost of global cyber crime. The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, specifies the acts that are punishable. Cyber crime has also affected the social media. A crime prevention plan with clear priorities and targets needs to be established, and government should include permanent guidelines in its programmes and structure for controlling crime and ensuring that clear responsibilities and goals exist within government for the organization of crime prevention. This chapter seeks to find out the motives and suspects of cyber crime perpetration and suggests measures for crime prevention.
Remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be the new normal, suggesting a situation where people use their personal computers at home for several activities like reading emails, surfing the web, chatting with friends. While doing this, users are not focused on securing their systems and they often do not have the skills and knowledge to defend against cybercrime. In this paper, we present the design and the evaluation of a novel interface that warns users against phishing attacks. This interface looks like the ones shown by browsers like Chrome and Firefox when opening a suspicious phishing website, but it includes information that explains the reasons why the website might be a scam. Such explanations are based on website features commonly used by AI-based systems to classify a website as phishing or not and aim to help users detecting phishing websites. To ensure a high understandability and effectiveness of the explanations, the C-HIP model was adopted to design such messages, which have been iteratively refined performing a static analysis of their comprehension, sentiment, and readability.
"In the current technological climate, there is an increase in the number of instances of cybercrime. In the real world, it is never simple to track down and apprehend a cybercriminal. Even if the perpetrator is captured, it will be challenging to secure his conviction since there are not enough standardized digital investigation models. As a consequence of a badly handled forensic investigation, a person who committed a cyber crime may go free, while an innocent person may be subject to adverse ramifications as a result of the inquiry. Forensic investigators are required to adhere to consistent and well-defined forensic methods in order to successfully capture and prosecute cyber criminals. In recent years, a number of new investigating models for digital forensics have been developed; nonetheless, the percentage of cases that result in a conviction remains low since the same investigation model is not relevant in all nations. This chapter introduces a one-of-a-kind Digital Forensic Investigation Model that is built on the architecture and cyber regulations of the Indian subcontinent."
Internet Forensics has become an indispensable part of Cyber Forensics. This is due to the rapid growth in the number of cybercrimes which are related to Internet usage. These crimes vary from malw are crimes to crimes related to use of Social Media, banking transactions and other financial services. In these type of crimes, the browser files which are generated by different web browsers, should be analyzed. Among the different artifacts left by web browsers, the most relevant file in forensic investigation is the cache file as it stores important cyber forensics information of frequently visited websites. Investigators can obtain a clear picture of visited websites, loaded pictures and other objects using the information stored in the cache files. The paper describes the structure of cache files created by Google Chrome in detail. The results obtained in this way can provide forensically sound information in cybercrime investigation. Advanced analysis of java scripts and other objects obtained in this way provide crucial evidence in proving different types of cybercrimes including malw are crimes.
"This paper examines the current state of cryptocurrency forensics focusing on digital forensics investigation supporting law enforcement activities. We begin with a brief overview of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, and with that understanding, we explore criminal and malicious activities enabled by these technologies which drive the need for cryptocurrency forensics. Followed by this, the paper will explore current cryptocurrency forensics techniques and challenges pertaining to mobile forensics, computer & memory forensics, and blockchain & network forensics. We will analyze the current body of research and identify gaps in the area. Also, current researchers and practicing investigators indicate that cryptocurrency forensics seems to be lagging and needs improved inter-agency coordination along with forensic techniques to counter the existing and emerging threats.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

"Purpose Whilst anyone can be scammed, individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI) may have unique risk factors to cyberscams for which tailored interventions are required. To address this, a co-design approach was utilised to develop cybersafety resources with people with living experience of ABI and scams. This study aimed to evaluate the co-design experience to inform future utilisation of co-design methods. Method Semi-structured qualitative interviews explored perceived benefits and challenges, level of support and the co-design process for people with ABI (n= 7) and an attendant care worker (ACW) (n= 1). Transcripts were analysed using a six-stage reflexive thematic analysis. Results Five themes were identified: An Intervention Addressing Shame; Feeling Validated and Valued; Experiencing a 'Profound Change Amongst a Group of Peers'; 'Gaining Stronger Scam Awareness'; and 'Taking Ownership'. Adjustments to support communication, memory impairments and fatigue in the co-design process were recommended. Conclusions Participant reflections on the co-design process extended beyond resource design and highlighted therapeutic benefits of increased insight and emotional recovery from shame. Likely mechanisms underpinning these benefits were the peer group format and opportunities to make meaningful contributions. Despite identified challenges in facilitating co-design projects, the practical and emotional benefits reported by participants underscore the value of co-design with people with ABI."
In the cyberspace environment, access control is one of the foremost fundamental safeguards used to prevent unauthorized access and to minimize the impact from security breaches. Fog computing preserves many benefits for the integration of both internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing platforms. Security in Fog computing environment remains a significant concern among practitioners from academia and industry. The current existing access control models, like the traditional Context-Aware Access Control (CAAC), are limited to access data from centralized sources, and not robust due to lack of semantics and cloud-based service. This major concern has not been addressed in the literature, also literature still lacks a practical solution to control fog data view from multiple sources. This paper critically reviews and investigates the limitations of current fog-based access control. It considers the trade-off between latency and processing overheads which has not been thoroughly studied before. In this paper, a new generation of Fog-Based Context-Aware Access Control (FB-CAAC) framework is proposed to enable flexible access control data from multiple sources. To fill the gap in the literature this paper introduces (i) a general data model and its associated mapping model to collate data from multiple sources. (ii) a data view model to provide an integrated result to the users, dealing with the privacy requirements of the associated stakeholders, (iii) a unified set of CAAC policies with an access controller to reduce both administrative and processing overheads, and (iv) a data ontology to represent the common classes in the relevant data sets. The applicability of FB-CAAC proposal is demonstrated via a walkthrough of the entire mechanism along with several case studies and a prototype testing. The results show the efficiency, flexibility, effectiveness, and practicality of FB-CAAC for data access control in fog computing environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
"During the last decades, Dark Web content has risen in necessity in an increasingly connected world, where international anonymous networks provide access to data marketplaces and illicit multimedia material through the TOR or I2P networks. The motivation behind this paper is to gauge the current state and growth of the Dark Web in relation to the role it plays with special focus on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs and MEs). More specifically, we devise Machine Learning and specialised Information Retrieval techniques to extract insights and investigate how the Dark Web enables cybercrime, maintains marketplaces with breached enterprise data collections and pawned email accounts. The research questions that we address concern: a) the role that the Dark Web plays for SMEs, MEs, and society in general; b) the criticality of cybercriminal activities and operations in the Dark Web exploiting threat taxonomies and scoring schemes; and c) the maturity and efficiency of technical tools and methods to curb illegal activities on the Dark Web through raising awareness via efficient text analytics, visual reporting and alerting mechanisms."
IT security becomes increasingly important due to the rise of cybercrime incidents but also obligatory security and privacy laws that include confidentiality regulations. To prevent cybercriminal attacks, the business level has to identify critical business data and introduce organization-wide security standards. A close cooperation with the IT level is crucial to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings of security requirements, both may cause severe security breaches. An important building block are access control requirements (ACRs). In a costly, complex and manual role engineering process, experts have to elicit appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) policies according to business security and confidentiality models. This paper makes a first step to close this gap with an approach that automatically extracts business level ACRs from BPMN business processes to build an initial RBAC role model and establish traceability from RBAC policies to business processes. Case study results indicate that the accuracy of extracted policies is appropriate, adaptations in evolution scenarios become faster and human errors are reduced during the engineering of RBAC policies.
The underground economy is a key component in cyber carding crime ecosystems because it provides a black marketplace for cyber criminals to exchange malicious tools and services that facilitate all stages of cyber carding crime. Consequently, black market sellers are of particular interest to cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. Malware/carding sellers are critical to cyber carding crime since using malwares to skim credit/debit card information and selling stolen information are two major steps of conducting such crime. In the underground economy, the malicious product/service quality is reflected by customers' feedback. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based framework for identifying top malware/carding sellers. The framework uses snowball sampling, thread classification, and deep learning-based sentiment analysis to evaluate sellers' product/service quality based on customer feedback. The framework was evaluated on a Russian carding forum and top malware/carding sellers from it were identified. Our framework contributes to underground economy research as it provides a scalable and generalizable framework for identifying key cybercrime facilitators.
Nowadays, botnets are the most advanced cybercrime as being powerful threaten to the internet infrastructure by risking the Internet stability and security. Millions of computers have been hijacking and infecting by botnets especially during peak activity. The P2P botnets exploit users and dominating the P2P technology which make botnets are harder to detect and terminated. As P2P botnets issues been highlighted as it's dramatically evolvement, this paper addresses on current problems relate to P2P botnets faced by users and recommending the improvement. Also, this paper concentrated on proposing P2P botnets detection framework. Also, an in-depth analysis of P2P botnets has been conducted to understand and cope with their behaviors and characteristics. The new improvement has been introduced at the propose botnets framework architecture to improve the effectiveness of P2P detection analysis. The framework architecture has been structuralized with hybrid analyzer through the marriage of host-based and network based. Prior to this matter, this research has proposed a new enhancement on framework architecture that has been reinforced by hybrid detection technique to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of P2P botnets detection.
"There are several issues associated with Dark Web Structural Patterns mining (including many redundant and irrelevant information), which increases the numerous types of cybercrime like illegal trade, forums, terrorist activity, and illegal online shopping. Understanding online criminal behavior is challenging because the data is available in a vast amount. To require an approach for learning the criminal behavior to check the recent request for improving the labeled data as a user profiling, Dark Web Structural Patterns mining in the case of multidimensional data sets gives uncertain results. Uncertain classification results cause a problem of not being able to predict user behavior. Since data of multidimensional nature has feature mixes, it has an adverse influence on classification. The data associated with Dark Web inundation has restricted us from giving the appropriate solution according to the need. In the research design, a Fusion NN (Neural network)-(SVM)-V-3 for Criminal Network activity prediction model is proposed based on the neural network; NN- (SVM)-V-3 can improve the prediction."
Cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy just under USD 1 trillion in 2020, indicating an increase of more than 50% since 2018. With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks.
Mobile systems abled a way to shorten the distance between Men. With this panorama also came cybercrime, terrorism and other phenomena of a moving society fully globalized, where the land borders are of little importance in the task of limiting the active agents, harmful or not, to these systems. Recently the world discovered by media and scientific projects that the leading powers watch closely their citizens, aimed directly the mobile systems that they use in conversations, e-mail or Web traffic. Recurring to powerful monitoring and surveillance tools, peaceful or in turmoil nations persecute and deny uncontrolled web access without armful repercussions to their citizens. The present work is the result of the application of the Paranoid Operative Systems methodology in a mobile operative system, something that so far is only been showed in a desktop operative system. To support this study, an analysis of platforms that allow for anonymous web browsing, technologies and programs with potential computer intrusion and violation of privacy was conducted. This study analysed the computer monitoring and surveillance technologies identifying the available countermeasure.
The Internet and connected technology platforms have enabled an increase of cyber influence activity. These actions target a range of personal to national level security and privacy attributes related to cybercrime, behavior, and identities. These emerging threats call for new indicators for improved awareness, decisions, and action. This research proposes a cyber-physical-human spectrum of identification with a prototyped classification method. Classifier goals are to aid in awareness of activity and potential harmful intent such as detection of identity feature acquisition, fraudulent identities and entities, and targeting or influential behavior. Emerging malicious influence actors prey on human social demographic groups and trends using the Internet infrastructure with social network platform access to large target populations as their attack surface. The methodology discusses how this problem could benefit from a combined human-technical approach to understand indicators of influencing human perception that persuade someone perform a desired action. This method is designed to aid in rapid influence awareness and introduce a counter-influence concept. A prototyped experiment trial demonstrates how awareness may be beneficial to balancing national security with personal privacy.
To ensure the security of web applications and to reduce the constant risk of increasing cybercrime, basic security principles like integrity, confidentiality and availability should not be omitted. Even though Transport Layer Security/Secure Socket Layer (TLS/SSL) authentication protocols are developed to shield websites from intruders, these protocols also have their fair share of problems. Incorrect authentication process of websites can give birth to notorious attack like Man in The Middle attack, which is widespread in HTTPS websites. In MITM attack, the violator basically positions himself in a communication channel between user and website either to eavesdrop or impersonate the communicating party to achieve malicious goals. Initially, the MITM attack is defined as a binary machine learning problem. Deep Q learning is utilized to build the MITM attack classification model. Thereafter, training process is applied on 60% of the obtained dataset. Remaining 40% dataset is used for testing purpose. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique performs significantly better than the existing machine learning technique-based MITM prediction techniques for SSL/TLS-based websites.
A few highly skilled cybercriminals run the Crime as a Service business model. These expert hackers provide entry-level criminals with tools that allow them to enhance their cybercrime operations significantly. Thus, effectively and efficiently disrupting highly proficient cybercriminals is of a high priority to law enforcement. Such individuals can be found in vast underground forums, though it is particularly challenging to identify and profile individual users. We tackle this problem by combining two analysis methods: text analysis with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Social Network Analysis with centrality measures. In this paper, we use LDA to eliminate around 79% of hacker forum users with very low to no technical skills, while also inferring the forum roles held by the remaining users. Furthermore, we use centrality measures to identify users with hugely popular public posts, including users with very few public posts who receive much attention from their peers. We study various preprocessing methods, wherein we achieve our results by following a series of rigorous preprocessing steps. Our proposed method works towards overcoming current challenges in identifying and interrupting highly proficient cybercriminals.
Cybercrime is on the rise, especially for the insurance industry, which collects massive amounts of sensitive data. In response, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the Model Insurance Data Security Act. This model law provides that state-licensed insurers must conduct a risk assessment as well as implement appropriate security measures, and it lays out when insurers must report data breaches to state insurance commissioners or consumers. As states have implemented their own versions of an Insurance Data Security Act, they have often modified it to make compliance easier for insurers, but in doing so have weakened its safeguards. Iowa's Insurance Data Security Act broadened exemptions for small insurers significantly, creating a gap in privacy protection that leaves many consumers vulnerable to data breaches. This Note argues that Iowa should close this gap by amending the law to narrow the exemptions back to the model law's original scope and help small insurers bear the significant costs of compliance by providing data privacy consultations, education, and/or lobbing the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to provide these necessary resources.
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions by many countries worldwide to control the spread of the virus forced several organizations to shift work to homes, aided by digital technologies. However, digital infrastructure and homeworking space, which facilitate home-based e-working, are constrained in the developing world. It is, therefore, crucial to understand how developing country organizations maintain business operations under pandemic situations using home-based e-working and the challenges it poses. This study employs interpretive qualitative research methodology with a socio-technical perspective to explore home-based e-working under COVID-19 conditions using five reputable corporate organizations in Ghana. Findings from the study show that home-based e-working under pandemic conditions can be seen as a business continuity strategy that requires business continuity policy and plan, digital infrastructure and platforms, and cybersecurity. The findings also identified the challenges as partial work virtualization, cybercrime, transition cost, digital divide, and home environment constraints. The findings have implications for research and organizational management in developing countries.
The popularity of Ethereum decentralized applications (Dapps) also brings in new security risks: it has been reported that these Dapps have been under various kinds of attacks from cybercriminals to gain profit. To the best of our knowledge, little has been done so far to understand this new cybercrime, in terms of its scope, criminal footprints and attack operational intents, not to mention any efforts to investigate these attack incidents automatically on a large scale. In this paper, we performed the first measurement study on real-world Dapp attack instances to recover critical threat intelligence (e.g., kill chain and attack patterns). Utilizing such threat intelligence, we proposed the first technique DE-FIER to automatically investigate attack incidents on a large scale. Running DEFIER on 2.3 million transactions from 104 Ethereum on-chain Dapps, we were able to identify 476,342 exploit transactions on 85 target Dapps, which related to 75 0-day victim Dapps and 17K previously-unknown attacker EOAs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest Ethereum on-chain Dapp attack incidents dataset ever reported.
There is weak integration of digital forensics and forensic science, despite over a decade of effort to break down the borders between them. As more criminal investigations involve digital traces in increasing amounts and complexity, the quality of digital forensic results is decreasing and comprehension of cybercrime is diminishing. The consequences of errors and omissions in digital forensics include imprisoning innocent people, leaving dangerous criminals free to perpetrate additional crimes, and continuing victimization of the organizations and people targeted by offences. To mitigate these risks it is necessary to harmonize digital forensics and forensic science, and to strengthen knowledge management throughout decentralized forensic ecosystems. To drive the needed harmonization and knowledge management, there are two essential roles: the investigative advisor with operational experience, and the forensic advisor with scientific background. These advisors can negotiate the borders between police, digital forensic specialists, criminal intelligence analysts and attorneys to cultivate a criminal justice system that treats digital traces effectively, has visibility across criminal activities, and addresses crime and security more strategically.
The rapid increase in cybercrime, causing a reported annual economic loss of $600 billion (Lewis 2018), has prompted a critical need for effective cyber defense. Strategic criminals conduct network reconnaissance prior to executing attacks to avoid detection and establish situational awareness via scanning and fingerprinting tools. Cyber deception attempts to foil these reconnaissance efforts by camouflaging network and system attributes to disguise valuable information. Game-theoretic models can identify decisions about strategically deceiving attackers, subject to domain constraints. For effectively deploying an optimal deceptive strategy, modeling the objectives and the abilities of the attackers, is a key challenge. To address this challenge, we present Cyber Camouflage Games (CCG), a general-sum game model that captures attackers which can be diversely equipped and motivated. We show that computing the optimal defender strategy is NP-hard even in the special case of unconstrained CCGs, and present an efficient approximate solution for it. We further provide an MILP formulation accelerated with cut-augmentation for the general constrained problem. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that our solution methods are efficient and effective.
Images of main memory are an increasingly important piece of evidence in cybercrime investigations, especially against advanced malware threats, and software tools that dump memory during normal system operation are the most common way to acquire memory images today. Of all proposed methods, Stuttgen and Cohen's robust memory acquistion (as implemented in the pmem tool) can be considered the most advanced technique today. This paper presents Styx, of a proof-of-concept system that perfectly covers its traces against pmem and other tools that perform software-based forensic memory acquisition. Styx is implemented as a loadable kernel module and is able to subvert running 64-bit Linux systems using Intel's VT-x hardware virtualization extension, without requiring the system to reboot. It further uses the second address translation via Intel's EPT to hide behind hidden memory. While exhibiting the limitations of robust memory acquisition, it also shows the potential of undetectable forensic analysis software. (c) 2018 The Author(s).

The rapid development of the cyberspace brought about a relatively new type of crime, namely cybercrime, that transcends both time and space convergence conditions of traditional crime definitions. The darknet and anonymity it assures have been very inviting for cybercriminals in the recent years and it has been plagued with criminal activity, such as distribution of child pornography, illegal arms trafficking or drug trafficking. The purpose of the paper is to show legislative limits of investigating crimes committed using the darknet in Slovenia on examples of a few basic investigative acts: identification of the IP holder, search and seizure of electronic devices, undercover investigative measures and use of malware. Our main finding is that the current legal limitations do not allow a deep darknet investigation of potential offenders. If an IP address of a potential offender is leaked, law enforcement authorities can identify the IP address holder and seize his related electronic devices. The current legal limitations effectively end the investigation at this point as they do not allow the use of any kind of malware by the law enforcement authorities.
Recently published reports on cybercrime indicate an ever-increasing number of security incidents related to IT systems. Many attacks causing the incidents abuse (in) directly one or more security defects. Fixing the security defect once fielded is costly. To avoid the defects and the subsequent need to fix them, security has to be considered thoroughly when developing software. The earliest phase to do so is the requirements engineering, in which security threats should be identified early on and treated by defining sufficient security requirements. In a previous paper [1], we introduced a methodology for Problem-based Security Requirements Elicitation (PresSuRE). PresSuRE provides a computeraided security threat identification. The identification is based on the functional requirements for a system-to-be. Still, there is a need for guidance on how to derive security requirements once the threats are identified. In this work, we provide such guidance extending PresSuRE and its tool support. We illustrate and validate our approach using a smart grid scenario provided by the industrial partners of the EU project NESSoS.
"Social media platforms are crucial public forums connecting users around the world through a decentralised cyberspace. These platforms host high volumes of content and, as such, employ content moderators (CMs) to safeguard users against harmful content like child sexual abuse material (CSAM). These roles are critical in the social media landscape however, CMs' work as digital first responders is complicated by legal and systemic debates over whether the policing of cyberspace should be left to the self-regulation of technology companies, or if greater state-regulation is required. In this empirical policy and literature review, major debates in the area of content moderation and, in particular, the online policing of CSAM are identified and evaluated. This includes the issue of territorial jurisdiction, and how it obstructs traditional policing; concerns over free speech and privacy if CMs are given greater powers, and debates over whether technology companies should be legally liable for user-generated content (UGC). In outlining these issues, a more comprehensive foundation for evaluating current practices for monitoring and combatting online CSAM is established which illustrates both the practical and philosophical challenges of the existing status quo, wherein the state and private companies share these important responsibilities."
The exploitation of Internet technology represents for terrorists and criminals a convenient means for establishing and advertising illegal activities. Especially, social networks facilitate new collaborations as well as the spreading of information with a lower risk of being exposed and fetched. Indeed, due to the increasing number of social media and the huge amount of data continuously generated from them, the discovering process of cyber-criminals is a hard task to be performed by the Law Enforcement Agencies and Police Forces if only based on traditional approaches. It becomes even harder if the heterogeneous nature of data, due to multi-cultural aspects, such as the variety of languages, is considered during the searching process. As a consequence, the adoption of a computer-based approach represents a viable solution. In particular, this paper aims at supporting the automatic identification process of potential online suspicious users, who act on social media. A methodological process, centered on the combination of well-known text analysis techniques by considering multi-language aspects, is proposed. In addition, an evaluation approach, based on the exploitation of different qualitative evaluation criteria, is employed to assess the level of suspiciousness of the identified users. Finally, a software tool that supports the execution of the proposed process is developed and its experimentation is shown through a case study on Twitter.
The global mobile networks are built with a set of core technologies developed during the 1980s, combined with subsequent generations of networking technologies for improved performance. Due to political pressure by European governments during the 1980 the initial GSM network, commonly called 2G, was purposely designed and built with weak security to allow easy interception of phone traffic by law enforcement agencies. Despite strengthened security in the more recent networking technologies of 3G and 4G, the weak security of 2G represents the 'weakest link' which thereby limits the security level of mobile networks in general. While this cybersecurity vulnerability is currently exploited by domestic law enforcement agencies for legal interception and surveillance, as well as by criminal and foreign powers for cybercrime and espionage, it is interesting to notice that it was created on purpose. This paper describes the background and the evolution of mobile network security, analyses the nature and consequences of security vulnerabilities in mobile networks, and proposes political and technical solutions to mitigate the threats posed by these vulnerabilities.
Key Points In South Africa, a similar regulation strategy to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, called the Protection of Personal Information Act (No 4 of 2013) (POPIA), will be implemented, with a view to mitigate cybercrime and information security vulnerabilities. A qualitative exploratory analysis of information security management at universities in South Africa, using a Technology, Organisation, and Environment model, highlights the need for maintaining the security infrastructure to facilitate management of security within the university network, while placing emphasis on information security management processes, such as risk analysis, architecture review, code inspection, and security testing. Organizational factors were the most critical factors when compared to the technological and environmental factors which appear to influence the effectiveness of information security measures and, subsequently, data regulation readiness. Universities will have to balance the implementation of tangible solutions to mitigate risks within the scope of their budget while promoting user compliance, despite perceived 'restrictions.' For biomedical researchers, questions remain on the impact of POPIA legislation on data sharing, open science, and collaborations.
The security of personal data is crucial for a company or any individual. Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous cybercrime attacks. These attacks aim to steal information used by individuals and organizations using social engineering, which is a key point for the success of the phishing attack. Even though there are several systems and solutions, the amount of personal information stolen continues to increase as cyberattacks become more difficult to detect. This paper consists of a broad review to study the work carried out in the fight against phishing and the identification of vulnerabilities in existing systems to achieve better efficiency. The authors focused on the social medium Twitter to study the phishing attacks passing through this medium, and they present their new design, which is based on new features. The classification of the approach includes 23 features and uses the MLP artificial neural network (ANN MLP) algorithm. Experiments show that the system is effective at detecting phishing sites, with a 96% success rate using recent data.
The growth of the Internet has seen the emergence of elaborate examples of cybercrime in the form of 'scams'. Alongside this, a resistance has also developed, with 'scambaiters' engaging in complex and deceptive scenarios to waste scammers' time and educate others about online scams. This has been facilitated by the evolution of new media platforms inclusive of the live stream video-sharing site Twitch, where scambaiters take part in interactions with scammers in real time in front of large audiences. Such platforms present significant potential for diverse interaction and participation roles that move beyond those of other sites and audiovisual media. Scambaiting texts thus present a valuable opportunity to explore the complex interactive affordances of live stream video-sharing platforms. In this article, we aim to map an interactional framework for live-streamed video-sharing platforms by analysing a scambait call by the scambaiter 'Kitboga' on Twitch. The results show that the platform of Twitch and the novel context of a live-streamed scambait call offer new insights into online interaction within the context of emerging digital genres.
The present study explores the relationship between cybersecurity knowledge, online behavior, and risk perception. To simulate an online shopping experience, we invited participants to access our newly designed website and answer a set of questions to evaluate their level of cybersecurity knowledge. The experiment identifies multiple subsequent stages that enhance different features of the social online shopping literature by offering different tasks. The online activities provided on our website play the role of essential vital enablers to interact with the user such as giving the buyer the chance to earn more credits in exchange for private information, saving the virtual credit card information and selecting a specific shopping scenario. Our outcomes highlight the significance of engaging individuals with cybersecurity and provide an analysis of consumer profiling and practice in an online shopping context. Moreover, our findings lead to two sets of actions: reducing the perceived risk of cybercrime in online activities by increasing the level of knowledge in cybersecurity and evolving user behavior when spotting a high level of privacy concern.
IoT is an emerging technology nowadays, which integrates personal computers (PC), Laptops, smart phones and other electronic gadgets used in our routine life communication. This communication can be for leisure purposes or for any official task. Twitter is the most popular Instant Message (IM) toolkit in today's world. The digital remains left after using twitter can be of great source of evidence when an IoT is involved in a court of law. These evidences can be helpful in finding the culprit. For this purpose, digital forensics of IM can be practiced in order to find the evidences and from those evidences the law and order maintaining officer and the officials responsible for security of information can find some heinous cybercrime syndicates. This research has targeted on the usage of Twitter on the desktop PC under windows 10 operating system for the purpose of presenting supportive digital evidences for information security concerns by collecting and analyzing volatile digital bread crumbs. This analysis is done by using forensic tools such as belkasoft Ramcapturer, Wireshark and ProDiscover basic.
This study discusses whether the concept of societal security is embedded in the Rus- sian formal and informal discourses as well as in the Russian strategic documents on national security and the Baltic Sea region. Particularly, the paper describes four paradigms of international relations (neorealism, neoliberalism, globalism and post -positivism) and theoretical approaches to the concept of societal security formulated in them. On a practical plane, Russia has managed to develop - together with other regional players - a common regional approach to understanding societal securi- ty threats and challenges in the Baltic Sea region. These challenges include uneven regional development, social and gender inequalities, unemployment, poverty, manifestations of intolerance, religious and political extremism, separatism, large-scale migration, climate change, natural and man-made catastrophes, transnational organized crime and cybercrime, international terrorism, so-called hybrid threats, disharmony between education systems, etc. In 2017, Russia and other Baltic countries agreed that the Council of the Baltic Sea States would be the regional institution to implement a common societal security strategy exemplified by the Baltic 2030 Agenda Action Plan.
"Purpose Global evidence suggests that youth offending has reduced; however, this study aims to suggest a more complex picture, with youth crime potentially being displaced to the digital space. Historically, young people and crime have been synonymous with public spaces and being visible. A shift or expansion to online offending requires revision of how the justice and educational systems respond to youth offending. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review explored keywords related to age, digital offence or harm and criminal or harmful nature, using a search, appraisal, synthesis and analysis framework. Findings Three emergent areas of digital youth crime are discussed: digitally assisted crime, digitally dependent crime and digital harm. Practical implications The shift in youth offending requires response adjustment from prevention to detection. Opportunities may exist to disrupt or redirect youth before they offend. Further data specific to digital offending is needed. These findings seek to provide a possible direction for future research. Originality/value The concept of digital displacement of youth offending is progressively emerging. This paper examines types of offending categorised into three areas of interest."
Multimedia content's development and technological evolution have enhanced and even facilitated the application of steganography as a means to introduce hidden messages for cybercrime-related purposes. Artificial intelligence models have been widely implemented as a way to detect the presence of these messages in image content. However, the possibility of applying explainability techniques in order to provide visual representations of the signatures of different steganography algorithms has not been studied yet. This work presents a novel steganalysys methodology, STEG-XAI, not only for detecting steganography in images but also for explaining the machine learning model's findings, and extracting the steganography algorithm's signature. A convolutional neural network with EfficientNet architecture is implemented, along with the explainability algorithms LIME and Grad-CAM. The model is trained with a dataset of images modified by UERD, a steganography method designed for JPEG images, and achieves a weighted AUC of 0.944, displaying a high level of discrimination between original and tampered images. Furthermore, the explanation methods enable visualizing both the image modifications identified by the neural network, and a signature of the UERD algorithm.
Phishing is an increasingly serious cybercrime. Phishers create phishing websites by mimicking legitimate websites to confuse users and steal their personal information. The proliferation of phishing websites and more advanced camouflage techniques are problems faced by most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a features fusion networks (MultiPhish) which is the first study on fusing multi-modal features with neural networks for the phishing detection task. In this end-to-end network, the domain and favicon of the website are represented via deep neural networks, and the representation of the website identity is obtained through multi-modal features fusion. In addition, the variation autoencoder (VAE) is introduced to optimize the representation. In the phishing detection module, we incorporate URL features to improve situations where phishing websites cannot be detected only by estimating whether the website identity is disguised. Based on the latest collected dataset, we have carried out extensive experiments and proved that our model is superior to the relevant methods. In addition, MultiPhish is a completely language-independent strategy, so it can perform phishing detection regardless of the text language.
OVER TWO BILLION users consume social media to build and participate in online social networks (OSNs), uploading and sharing hundreds of billions of data items. 15 OSNs are not only huge in scale, they are predicted to keep growing in the coming years both in the number of users and in the amount of data users upload and share. The vast amount of data in social media is user-generated and personal most of the time, which clearly calls for appropriate privacy preservation mechanisms that allow users to benefit from social media while adequately protecting their personal information. Protecting users' privacy is not only essential to respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but also to serve as a first line of defense to mitigate cybercrime and other illegal activities that leverage the data obtained due to privacy breaches in social media, such as social phishing, identity theft, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying. There have been many efforts devoted to study privacy in social media and how to protect users' personal
Cybercrime has steadily increased over the last years, being nowadays the greatest security concern of most enterprises. Institutions often protect themselves from attacks by employing intrusion detection systems (IDS) that analyze the payload of packets to find matches with rules representing threats. However, the accuracy of these systems is as good as the knowledge they have about the threats. Nowadays, with the continuous flow of novel forms of sophisticated attacks and their variants, it is a challenge to keep an IDS updated. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) could be explored to effectively obtain this knowledge, by retrieving information from diverse sources. This paper proposes a fully automated approach to update the IDS knowledge, covering the full cycle from OSINT data feed collection until the installation of new rules and blacklists. The approach was implemented as the IDSoSint system and was assessed with 49 OSINT feeds and production traffic. It was able to identify in real time various forms of malicious activities, including botnet C&C servers communications, remote access applications, brute-force attacks, and phishing events.
The proposed model of a multi-agent environment for e-learning due to increase in the cybercrime was found to be susceptible to DOS attacks and personification attacks that is dealt by embedding the mitigation mechanism of IP filtering with the proposed model. Developing the e-learning environment in which an algorithm has been implemented to filter the spoofed IPs from the legitimate IPs. The multi-agent environment implemented with all the agents has been fortified along with the IP filtering algorithm which proves to be improving the performance. An e-learning platform usually concentrates on delivering the content to the legitimate users with an emphasis on the content delivery alone wherein the components of the Information Security need to be concentrated more. In this paper, we have proposed a solution that caters the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability without any hindrance to the performance of the system. The implementation of Dynamic Hop Count Filtering in the Multi-agent based e-learning environment is a system that mitigates the IP spoofing based DOS attacks on the system.
The Digital Age has brought great benefits for the human race but also some drawbacks. Nowadays, people from opposite corners of the World can communicate online via instant messaging services. Unfortunately, this has introduced new kinds of crime. Sexual predators have adapted their predatory strategies to these platforms and, usually, the target victims are kids. The authorities cannot manually track all threats because massive amounts of online conversations take place in a daily basis. Automatic methods for alerting about these crimes need to be designed. This is the main motivation of this paper, where we present a Machine Learning approach to identify suspicious subjects in chat-rooms. We propose novel types of features for representing the chatters and we evaluate different classifiers against the largest benchmark available. This empirical validation shows that our approach is promising for the identification of predatory behaviour. Furthermore, we carefully analyse the characteristics of the learnt classifiers. This preliminary analysis is a first step towards profiling the behaviour of the sexual predators when chatting on the Internet.
Technology has become a pivotal point in our society, this dependency is becoming increasingly more critical on a daily basis. This ranges from people to businesses and on a larger scale government organisations who are now increasingly focusing on becomingmore cyber resilient. This paper intends to provide an overview as to why a comprehensive knowledge management framework is necessity for SMEs on tackling cyber and cyber-enabled crimes. The paper explores new sources of data to reliably understand the importance as to why such a framework is required. This type of system can pave the way for SME's to devise their cyber strategy and to be able to respond efficiently to cyber-related incidents. One of the cyber weakness and vulnerabilities for the SME's are through their interactivity and or engagement with their suppliers and customers. Namely the interactions which take place via their respective internet sites, email communications, ports (using external devices, USB, CD drive, SD cards etc..) or the router (The use of their WIFI systems). The benefits of this framework model will be primarily to educate SME's in becoming more cyber resilient and provide them with the knowledge, awareness and techniques to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in their computer networks, devices and internet usage.
The COVID-19 pandemic was a catalyst for many different trends in our daily life worldwide. While there has been an overall rise in cybercrime during this time, there has been relatively little research done about malicious COVID-19 themed AndroidOS applications. With the rise in reports of users falling victim to malicious COVID-19 themed AndroidOS applications, there is a need to learn about the detection of malware for pandemics-themed mobile apps.. In this project, we extracted the permissions requests from 1959 APK files from a dataset containing benign and malware COVID-19 themed apps. We then created and compared eight unique models of four varying classifiers to determine their ability to identify potentially malicious APK files based on the permissions the APK file requests: support vector machine, neural network, decision trees, and categorical naive bayes. These classifiers were then trained using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset due to the lack of samples of malware compared to non-malware APKs. Finally, we evaluated the models using K-Fold Cross-Validation and found the decision tree classifier to be the best performing classifier.
Financial crimes are debilitating problems for economies, especially emerging ones. The scourge of financial crimes includes money laundering, fraud, drug and human trafficking, terrorism financing, bribery, embezzlement, market manipulation, tax evasion, identity theft, forgery and cybercrime. These problems are so intractable and potentially destructive that the collective effort to prevent or contain them has gone global. The imperative of enhanced transparency and financial system integrity, not only in national financial systems but also in the international financial order, has become inevitable. This has resulted in the landmark frameworks of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the G7's Financial Action Task Force. This paper discusses the legal combat of financial crimes in two major African economies: Nigeria and South Africa, with particular emphasis on money laundering and terrorism financing due to their direct negative macro-economic implications for any economy. The focus on the twin problems in those two economies is based on their pre-eminent position in Africa. The paper examines the legal frameworks for the prevention or containment of the scourge in the two countries and interrogates measures that could engender their effective control.
The steady growth of cryptowallets users and the widespread of cryptocurrencies adoption has inadvertently risen the numbers of cybercrime. The decentralized and pseudoanonymous nature of cryptocurrencies impose a unique challenge to the investigators. Unlike investigation on fiat currency where banks can be contacted to freeze account, cryptocurrencies do not have a centralized entity that can be contacted. On top of that, studies have shown that using a generic digital forensics methodology to collect and preserve cryptowallets, which often involves imaging and seizing, are ineffective for cryptocurrencies investigation. This is because criminals can recover his seized cryptowallets into other devices and thus continue to make transactions for illegal activities. This defeats the purpose of halting the criminals from conducting further crimes. Hence in this study we propose a methodology for preserving cryptowallets at crime scene. We then conducted evaluation on the methodology by using real case and simulation exercise on different types of cryptowallets. The result shows that our methodology can be used to properly preserve cryptocurrencies evidence. This study aims to identify gaps in cryptocurrencies investigation and address them by proposing a proper methodology.
This paper presents the first empirical study based on ground-truth data of a major Bullet-Proof Hosting (BPH) provider, a company called MaxiDed. BPH allows miscreants to host criminal activities in support of various cybercrime business models such as phishing, botnets, DDoS, spam, and counterfeit pharmaceutical websites. MaxiDed was legally taken down by law enforcement and its backend servers were seized. We analyze data extracted from its backend databases and connect it to various external data sources to characterize MaxiDed's business model, supply chain, customers and finances. We reason about what the inside view reveals about potential chokepoints for disrupting BPH providers. We demonstrate the BPH landscape to have further shifted from agile resellers towards marketplace platforms with an oversupply of resources originating from hundreds of legitimate upstream hosting providers. We find the BPH provider to have few choke points in the supply chain amendable to intervention, though profit margins are very slim, so even a marginal increase in operating costs might already have repercussions that render the business unsustainable. The other intervention option would be to take down the platform itself.
The last decades have been characterized by unprecedented technological advances, many of them powered by modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The world has become more digitally connected than ever, but we face major challenges. One of the most significant is cybercrime, which has emerged as a global threat to governments, businesses, and civil societies. The pervasiveness of digital technologies combined with a constantly shifting technological foundation has created a complex and powerful playground for cybercriminals, which triggered a surge in demand for intelligent threat detection systems based on machine and deep learning. This paper investigates AI-based cyber threat detection to protect our modern digital ecosystems. The primary focus is on evaluating ML-based classifiers and ensembles for anomaly-based malware detection and network intrusion detection and how to integrate those models in the context of network security, mobile security, and IoT security. The discussion highlights the challenges when deploying and integrating AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions into existing enterprise systems and IT infrastructures, including options to overcome those challenges. Finally, the paper provides future research directions to further increase the security and resilience of our modern digital industries, infrastructures, and ecosystems.
The emergence of digital technologies contributed to the emergence and rapid development of digital commerce, and at the same time, the number of electronic payments, the use of digital and virtual currencies increased. The article presents an analysis of the legal nature of such a financial instrument as cryptocurrency, characterizes the distinctive features, highlights the advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of the work is to consider the regulatory legal position of cryptocurrency in the modern world, to highlight the legal practice in cases of the circulation of cryptocurrency, to study the role of cryptocurrency in transnational offenses, to explore possible options for combating cybercrime, which is carried out using the use of cryptocurrency. The methodology of the work is represented by a set of methods and techniques, operations that are used to study the topic and achieve the set goal, namely: hermeneutic, historical, extrapolation, comparative-legal, comparison and generalization, analysis, synthesis, deduction. Results of the work: in today's reality there is no unified international legal regulation of cryptocurrency, which complicates the prevention and fight against transnational offenses, the means or subject of which are cryptocurrencies and mining.
"Fintech's development has amplified cybercrime, prompting trust and security concerns in banking. While earlier research predominantly viewed Fintech adoption through a tech-centric lens, emphasising its benefits, there is a paucity of studies on cognitive resistance arising from Fintech controversies. This review synthesises previous Fintech literature on behavioural intentions in banking, emphasising the role of trust, security, and other factors, and highlights existing research gaps. Utilising the ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses) framework, a Systematic Literature Review was conducted, analysing 26 articles from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases (2009-2022). Thematic analysis produces five primary themes (UTAUT2 variables; risk; trust; quality; and other), branching into 24 sub-themes. The weight analysis emphasises the best well-utilised predictors like performance expectancy, trust, security, perceived usefulness, and attitude. In addition, the review identifies research gaps and offers recommendations for future studies using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Constructs, and Method) framework. This research provides insights to Fintech companies and regulatory authorities on the preferred attributes of Fintech services that can enhance their adoption within the banking sector."
Fast and accurate malicious domain detection is an essential research theme to prevent cybercrime, and machine learning is an attractive approach for detecting unseen malicious domains in the past decade. In this paper, we present MADMAX (MAchine learning-baseD MAlicious domain eXhauster), a browser-based application leveraging extreme learning machine (ELM) for malicious domain detection. In contrast to the existing work of ELM-based domain detection, MADMAX newly introduces two methods, i.e., selection of optimized features to provide higher accuracy and throughput based on permutation importance and real-time training to retrain a model with an updated malicious dataset for continuous malicious domain detection. We demonstrate that MADMAX fairly outperforms the existing work with respect to accuracy and throughput by virtue of the selection of optimized features. Moreover, we also confirm a model with real-time training stably detects even unseen malicious domains, whereas accuracy of a model without the real-time training decreases due to the unseen domains. The source codes of MADMAX is publicly available via GitHub.
Cyber scam, an on-trend subculture among Nigerian urban youth, has posed a major security and economic threat to the global community. As part of the strategies developed to 'institutionalise' their illicit business and evade the punitive hand(s) of the Nigerian and international law enforcement agencies, cyber scammers in Nigeria have devised various strategies, including the deployment of anti-language and slangy expressions in their transactional and social interaction. Extant studies on cybercrime in the Nigerian context have largely addressed the phenomenon from the sociological, economical and information technological perspectives with little attention paid to it from a linguistic perspective. Therefore, this study, gathering data with the deployment of ethnographic techniques, and drawing from Halliday's (1976) concept of anti-language, investigates the linguistic strategies employed by cyber scammers in Southwestern Nigeria in their social and transactional interaction. Findings reveal slangy coinages and overlexicalisation, and relexicalisation (semantic extension) are anti-language phenomena characterising cyber scammers' language in region. These are achieved through the deployment of linguistic sub-strategies such as reduplication, clipping, blending and acronym (initialism).
A lot of research has been devoted to understanding the technical properties of amplification DDoS attacks and the emergence of the DDoS-as-a-service economy, especially the so-called booters. Much less is known about the consequences for victimization patterns. We profile victims via data from amplification DDoS honeypots. We develop victimization rates and present explanatory models capturing key determinants of these rates. Our analysis demonstrates that the bulk of the attacks are directed at users in access networks, not at hosting, and even less at enterprise networks. We find that victimization in broadband ISPs is highly proportional to the number of ISP subscribers and that certain countries have significantly higher or lower victim rates which are only partially explained by institutional factors such as ICT development. We also find that victimization rate in hosting networks is proportional to the number of hosted domains and number of routed IP addresses and that content popularity has a minor impact on victimization rates. Finally, we reflect on the implications of these findings for the wider trend of commoditization in cybercrime.
Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) is one of the most effective fingerprints used to detect the source camera of an image. Image Anonymization on the other hand, is a task of fooling the source camera identification, in order to protect the user's anonymity in sensitive situations involving whistleblowers, social activists etc. To protect the privacy of users especially over the web, image anonymization is of huge importance. Counter-Forensic attacks on source camera identification try to make an image anonymous by nullifying the detection techniques. For almost every counter-forensic source camera identification attack, anti-counter attacks are being designed and hence there is a need to either strengthen the previous counter-forensic attacks or design a new attack altogether. In this work, we propose a new counter-forensic attack to source camera identification, using the Universal Wavelet Relative Distortion function designed for steganography. The main principle behind UniversalWavelet Relative Distortion is to embed changes in an image in regions such as textures or noisy parts which are crucial to source camera identification. We show through our experiments, when a random bit-string is inserted recursively in an image, the correlation strength of the noise residual based source camera identification gets significantly weak and such methods fail to map the source camera of the image under question. In the proposed method, the visual quality of the modified image is not changed, which makes our method a strong solution to image anonymization.
The online sexual exploitation of children is facilitated by websites that form virtual communities, via hyperlinks, to distribute images, videos, and other material. However, how these communities form, are structured, and evolve over time is unknown. Collected using a custom-designed webcrawler, we begin from known child sexual exploitation (CE) seed websites and follow hyperlinks to connected, related, websites. Using a repeated measure design we analyze 10 networks of 300 + websites each - over 4.8 million unique webpages in total, over a period of 60 weeks. Community detection techniques reveal that CE-related networks were dominated by two large communities hosting varied material not necessarily matching the seed website. Community stability, over 60 weeks, varied across networks. Reciprocity in hyperlinking between community members was substantially higher than within the full network, however, websites were not more likely to connect to homogeneous-content websites.

Biometric and biographic exploits can help criminals avoid detection and thwart identification systems, as well as identify potential targets in social networks for commercial purposes.
Hacks are one of the most damaging types of cryptocurrency related crime, accounting for billions of dollars in stolen funds since 2009. Professional investigators at Chainalysis have traced these stolen funds from the initial breach on an exchange to off-ramps, i.e. services where criminals are able to convert the stolen funds into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. We analyzed six hack subnetworks of bitcoin transactions known to belong to two prominent hacking groups. We analyze each hack according to eight network features, both static and temporal, and successfully classify each hack to its respective hacking group through our newly proposed method. We find that the static features, such as node balance, in degree, and out degree are not as useful in classifying the hacks into hacking groups as temporal features related to how quickly the criminals cash out. We validate our operating hypothesis that the key distinction between the two hacking groups is the acceleration with which the funds exit through terminal nodes in the subnetworks.
Digital Forensics is the branch of science dealing with investigation of evidences recovered from digital devices, to safeguard against rapidly increasing cyber crimes in today's digital world. The Source Camera Identification (SCI) problem is to map an image under question correctly to its source device. Following a Digital Forensic approach, the source of an image is detected by post-priori investigation of traces left behind in the image, by the camera. Such traces are generated due to the post-processing operations an image undergoes inside a digital camera, after being captured. In this paper, we model the SCI problem as a machine learning classification problem and focus on the most crucial component of a learning model, i.e. feature selection. We propose three different techniques for feature selection: Filter based approach, Wrapper based approach using Genetic Algorithm (GA), and also a hybrid approach with both Filter and Wrapper methods combined together. We investigate the source detection accuracy that each technique succeeds to achieve. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed methods produced a much compact feature set, hence considerably improve the source detection accuracy and minimize the training time of the learning model, as compared to the state-of-the-art.
Perceptual hashing is widely used to search or match similar images for digital forensics and cybercrime study. Unfortunately, the robustness of perceptual hashing algorithms is not well understood in these contexts. In this paper, we examine the robustness of perceptual hashing and its dependent security applications both experimentally and empirically. We first develop a series of attack algorithms to subvert perceptual hashing based image search. This is done by generating attack images that effectively enlarge the hash distance to the original image while introducing minimal visual changes. To make the attack practical, we design the attack algorithms under a black-box setting, augmented with novel designs (e.g., grayscale initialization) to improve the attack efficiency and transferability. We then evaluate our attack against the standard pHash as well as its robust variant using three different datasets. After confirming the attack effectiveness experimentally, we then empirically test against real-world reverse image search engines including TinEye, Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yandex. We find that our attack is highly successful on TinEye and Bing, and is moderately successful on Google and Yandex. Based on our findings, we discuss possible countermeasures and recommendations.
Big Data is a term associated with large datasets that come into existence with the volume, velocity and variety of data. An ever increasing human dependence on computers and automated systems has caused data to increase massively. The substantial collection of data is not only helpful for researchers but equally valuable to investigators who intend to carry out forensic analysis of data associated with the criminal cases. The conventional methodologies of performing forensic analysis have changed with the emergence of big data because big data forensic requires more sophisticated tools along with the deployment of efficient frameworks. Up till now several techniques have been devised to help the forensic analysis of small datasets but none of the techniques have been studied by coupling them with big data. Hence in this paper different techniques have been studied by closely analyzing their feasibility in the extraction and the forensic analysis of evidence from large amounts of data. In this paper we discuss various sources of data and how techniques such as the MapReduce framework and phylogenetic trees can help a forensic investigator to visualize large data sets to conduct a forensic analysis. Since audio and video are an attractive source of forensic data therefore this paper also discusses the latest techniques that assist in the extraction of useful sound signals from noise infested audio signals. Similar techniques for forensic analysis of the images have also been presented. Based upon interviews conducted with the forensic professionals, the factors affecting big data forensic techniques along with their severity have been identified so that a scenario specific approach can also be adopted based upon the available investigative resources.
"Deterrence, treatment and legal response to online child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) offenders is enhanced by the joint consideration of technological behaviours and cognitions. CSEM offenders choose an environment based on both psychosexual needs and utility, and in turn that environment shapes future behaviour and reinforces cognitive distortions. This paper introduces lawless space theory, a theory of cyber criminality which posits that offenders will primarily choose and utilize a perceived lawless space that best meets their psychosocial and criminogenic needs in the most frictionless way; habituation and differential association in the lawless space will reduce the perceived risk; normalization will increase comfort in a particular lawless space, increasing friction costs that must be overcome to switch technologies; and additional countermeasures will only be implemented by offenders to reduce perceived risk and lower cognitive dissonance, but not at the expense of utility. The theory is explored through the exemplar of CSEM offences and offers explanatory power for the lifecycle of a lawless space, the use of legacy spaces in the presence of objectively more capable options, the simultaneous use of multiple spaces to meet different psychosexual needs, and the adoption of new technologies by offenders. Additionally, the gateway choice and progression of lawless space usage informs investigations, risk assessments, and deterrence efforts and provides behavioural treatment targets."
In recent years, botnet has become a popular technique for deploying cybercrime because it is hard to be prevented and easily cause devastating loss. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel approach that can automatically generate effective payload-based models purely based on the traffic of actual bot instances instead of signatures hand-tuned by human experts. In the learning phase, we group the packets of the botnet traffic and the benign traffic collected in advance according to their payload size and extract the signatures in the payload in order to generate the payload-based models. We then identify the high quality signatures to reduce the size of models via the information gain ratio and the probability. During the matching phase, the proposed approach uses these payload-based models to check each incoming packet. Moreover, these models can efficiently discriminate the malicious botnet traffic from the benign traffic since it doesn't perform any correlation between different packets. The proposed approach was evaluated with several real-world network traces. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect botnet traffic traces successfully (about 96.4%) with high efficiency and an acceptable low false alarm rate (about 0.9%).
The final type of cybercrime to be considered involves crimes that occur in online virtual worlds. While there is considerable literature available on other cybercrimes, as outlined in the previous chapters of this book, relatively little academic literature has been published concerning crime in online virtual worlds (Wall & Williams, 2007). Nevertheless, several cases have come to light concerning specific crimes in these environments, including both property offences (such as theft) and crimes against the person (such as sexual assault). It should be noted that while the term 'crime' will be used in this chapter to describe these events, they may not necessarily be illegal or criminal events, at least so far as the offline world would consider them to be. This chapter aims to describe these types of virtual crimes, and to determine if they could and should be considered criminal events. The effects of the crimes on the victims will also be considered, and the necessity for policing virtual worlds will be discussed. In addition, the online community needs to consider how to deal with virtual offenders - if their offence has real-world consequences, should they be punished offline, or only in the virtual world?
As cybercrime activity increasingly uses anonymous technologies, the dramatic growth of child sexual exploitations on the dark web has posed a challenge to law enforcement agencies. Data were gathered in 2019 and 2020 through face - to - face interviews with a juvenile in New Taipei City, Taiwan. This paper extends the application of social learning theory to online child sexual abuse behavior. Research testing Akers's social learning theory has been confined to sexual offenses against children on the dark web. A social learning concept of differential association, definitions, imitation, and differential reinforcement is illustrated and supported by online child sexual abuse behavior findings. Before it occurs, preventing child sexual abuse has become a critical issue and necessary effort from all areas of society: family caring, school instruction, community-based treatment, and social values. An innovative social learning strategy to battle online child sexual abuse is proposed to reduce juvenile delinquency on the dark web. Every child, parent, teacher, or social worker who works with children should realize what child sexual abuse is and prevent it.
As an effective tool for penetrating firewalls and bypassing supervision and censorship, Shadowsocks is widely used, and there are also illegal network activists. If there is a traffic identification system that can identify applications over Shadowsocks, it can greatly facilitate the supervision, traceability, and evidence collection of cybercrime activities. In this paper, we propose an application over Shadowsocks's traffic identification system, which adds the sliding window JS divergence feature on the basis of the traditional statistics and distribution based on traffic packet length and timestamp. This feature can effectively reduce the impact on smart phone differences without reducing the accuracy of the same individual device application traffic recognition, while maintaining the characteristics of the application as much as possible, thereby greatly improve our traffic recognition the robustness of the system. Experimental results show that our system can achieve an accuracy of 94.5% on the same smart phone. On the data sets collected by different smart phones, our work has achieved an accuracy of 80.4%, which has certain practicality.
This Innovative Practice Full Paper describes an implementation of a Social Engineering course. Social Engineering (SE), which is the process of obtaining unauthorized access to systems by exploiting humans, has been flagged by the FBI and US Banking Industry as a threat to national security. According to a report by McAfee, the global cost of cybercrime has exceeded $1 trillion since 2018, and an additional $ 145 billion was spent on cybersecurity in 2020. Research has shown that 97% of cybersecurity attacks employ some element of social engineering. This Innovative Practice paper will present an effective and hands-on course designed to introduce students to social engineering penetration testing. The course is based on a social constructivism approach to learning, where students first develop an understanding of the individual and social context of social engineering. It uniquely combines the psychology of human behavior, legal precepts, and computer science to identify how psychological principles are applied in cyberspace to exploit individuals and how the same principles can be applied during SE penetration testing to detect vulnerabilities.
There is worldwide concern over the issues of citizenship and the misuse of information technology such as cybercrime and also environmental damage due to global warming. The main factors that cause these problems are the characteristics of humans themselves, and the weakness of digital and ecological citizenship, which ultimately leads to ignorance of the negative effects of technology abuse and also excessive exploitation of nature and environmental destruction without being able to maintain balance. These problems have a very large impact on the survival of humankind. Therefore, it is imperative that appropriate solutions are found. This paper aims to find a solution that has a programmed and sustainable structure in the face of weak digital and ecological citizenship. A suggested solution is innovative learning in civic education (Civics) as a curricular program in schools to shape digital and ecological citizenship for young citizens. Digital citizenship is formed using a value-based learning model often known as the value clarification technique (VCT) by considering nine elements of digital citizenship. Ecological citizenship is strengthened via eco-literacy using a project-based ecological citizen learning model.
ResearchGate has been regarded as one of the most attractive academic social networking site for scientific community. It has been trying to improve user-centered interfaces to gain more attractiveness to scientists around the world. Display of journal related scietometric measures (such as impact factor, 5-year impact, cited half-life, eigenfactor) is an important feature in ResearchGate. Open access publishing has added more to increased visibility of research work and easy access to information related to research. Moreover, scientific community has been much interested in promoting their work and exhibiting its impact to others through reliable scientometric measures. However, with the growing market of publications and improvements in the field of research, this community has been victimized by the cybercrime in the form of ghost journals, fake publishers and magical impact measures. Particularly, ResearchGate more recently, has been lenient in its policies against this dark side of academic writing. Therefore, this communication aims to discuss concerns associated with leniency in ResearchGate policies and its impact of scientific community.
This research addresses the implementation of digital signature technique for electronic prescription to prevent cybercrime problem such as robbery, modification and unauthorized access. In this research, RSA 2048-bit algorithm will be implemented in Java programming and android based system. Secure Electronic Prescription (SEP) application design is intended to combine given services, such as confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. Cryptography is used to ensure the prescription file and QR-Code for detailed information on the prescription that have been given only for the pharmacist. The QR-Code will be encrypted using an asymmetric algorithm based on NIST Standard. In the application, there are two schemes, namely the protection schemes and verification scheme. This research uses black-box testing, and white-box testing to test input values, code and output without testing the process and design that occurs in the system. We demonstrate the implementation of cryptography in Secure Electronic Prescription (SEP). The implementation of digital signature in this research can prevent archive thievery which is shown on implementation and is proven on the test.
Cybercrime has increased as a result of technology improvements and people's increasing reliance on smartphones and other technologies. SMS enables the dissemination of critical information, which is especially significant for non-digital savvy users who are typically the most isolated. Smishing, often known as SMS phishing, is the practice of sending phony text messages to trick someone into divulging personal information or installing malware. In Kenya, smishing crimes have been noted to escalate at a higher rate. However, there is no comprehensive investigation that has been done involving smishing attacks. There are various proposed solutions for mitigating smishing attacks. However, no existing solution authenticates the sender, filters the smishing content from the message, and informs the user of the potentially harmful content. Therefore, this study presents a novel method to authenticate the sender, filter smishing content from the message, and informs the user in case potentially harmful content exists in the message. Python, MYSQL, and Naive Bayes classifier were used to develop the model. The model will help mobile phone users to identify fraudulent messages sent by smishers quickly and effectively.
As cybercrime activity increasingly uses anonymous technologies, the dramatic growth of child sexual exploitations on the dark web has posed a challenge to law enforcement agencies. Data were gathered in 2019 and 2020 through face - to - face interviews with a juvenile in New Taipei City, Taiwan. This paper extends the application of social learning theory to online child sexual abuse behavior. Research testing Akers's social learning theory has been confined to sexual offenses against children on the dark web. A social learning concept of differential association, definitions, imitation, and differential reinforcement is illustrated and supported by online child sexual abuse behavior findings. Before it occurs, preventing child sexual abuse has become a critical issue and necessary effort from all areas of society: family caring, school instruction, community-based treatment, and social values. An innovative social learning strategy to battle online child sexual abuse is proposed to reduce juvenile delinquency on the dark web. Every child, parent, teacher, or social worker who works with children should realize what child sexual abuse is and prevent it.
Children nowadays are exposed to criminal activities and maltreatment, through the use of internet. The speedy and easy access to internet using smart phones becomes the contributing factors of many criminal activities including cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is a cybercrime that happened among children in Malaysia. Based on 2017 statistic, survey conducted by DIGI Cyber Safe found out that 90% of the children are at risk of being cybeibullied. The Malay Mail dated 27 Oct 2018 reported that Malaysia ranked 6th place in a global cyberbullying survey conducted among 28 countries, and 2nd place among the Asia countries in cyberbullying. Therefore, this study is conducted to examine the scenario of children cyber bullying in Malaysia and to identify the related legal provisions in force. This study employs library research method for data collection. The study analyse statutes, books, journals, reports, conference proceedings, and other periodicals. This study found out that Malaysia is still lacking on the provisions of protection of child in cyberbullying. (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher.
"This paper presents an analysis of the problems associated with effects that family has on a child's behavior. Our focus was on correlation between deviant behavior of young people and inadequate parental attachment. Relevance of this study is based on several fairly important, albeit dramatic, features of today including rapid increase in crime rates aggravated by involvement of young people in the new drug-related crimes and cybercrime, and a reported prevalence of disadvantaged and dysfunctional families in Russia. The purpose of this work is to examine various forms of parental attachment and assess their influence on deviant behavior of children. To these ends, we aimed to specify and clarify the conceptual apparatus; identify most common types of attachment within a family and forms of youth deviant behavior hereby; assess the modes and effects of inadequate parental attachment resulting in deviances and disorders among adolescents. Research of authentic sources allowed for a deep comparative analysis on the reported problem. The results confirmed the importance of a family in the individual system of life values, principles and goals."
Ethereum, as the second generation of blockchain technology, it not only brings many advantages, but also spawns various malicious incidents. Ethereum's anonymity makes it a hotbed of cybercrime, causing huge losses to users and severely disrupting the Ethereum ecosystem. To this end, this paper proposes a method for detecting malicious accounts in Ethereum based on ETH tracking tree (ETH-TT). Firstly, based on the transaction history replay mechanism, an ETH tracking algorithm for tracking the transaction amount of Ethereum is designed to obtain the ETH tracking tree, and extract sequence features from it. Then train the LSTM model to reduce the dimension of the sequence features to obtain the output features. Finally, detection is done by a machine learning classifier, fused with manual features from account transaction history. We uses 5576 malicious accounts and 4968 normal accounts as dataset for experiments. The results show that the ETHTT method can achieve an F1-score of 95.4% with the cooperation of the XGBoost classifier, which is better than the detection method using only manual features.
The popularity of mobile payment services lies in the convenient transactions they offer to users. In the age of growing cybercrime, however, mobile payment transactions carry risks of financial and data losses. It thus becomes critical to understand how risk and convenience have contrasting impacts on users' intention to use mobile payments. To investigate this, we consider various dimensions of perceived risk and perceived convenience to understand the net effect of their negative and positive influences on the intention to use. We also examine the actual use behavior predicted by intention along with the influence of habit. The research model, tested using survey responses from a sample of 215 users along with the descriptive answers from the survey respondents, helps us draw crucial insights. The study contributes to the field in a significant manner by providing insights into the balancing effect of risk and convenience on mobile payment service usage, as well as the development of the multi-dimensional scales for the key variables of risk and convenience.
With ever-increasing amounts of data collected from citizens and businesses in Smart City environments, public administration agencies manifest their position as central data holders. However, this great ownership of data makes them a target of cybercriminals on the hunt for illicit enrichment. The predominantly used type of cybercrime is phishing and increasingly spear phishing, a more personal, target-oriented kind of phishing. Such attacks make use of so-called persuasion techniques to lure their victims. In this study, four persuasion techniques, namely Authority, Urgency, Danger and Benefit, were tested for effectiveness in a two-phased field experiment cooperating with four German municipalities. In total, 3452 fake phishing e-mails were sent to 1276 public officials. Results show that the persuasion technique of Authority has worked best and therefore presumably poses the biggest threat to the information integrity of public sector agencies, followed by Urgency, Benefit and Danger. Additionally, the study provides insight on the potential impact of the effects of constant exposure to phishing and shows that the degree of domain-specificity of attacks impacts the susceptibility of victims.
Unarguably, the physical memory acquisition of contemporary computing devices has been an extremely pivotal and indispensable errand for digital forensics specialists because of its volatility of the embedded data, which was deposited from related computing resources. Nowadays, hundreds of millions of global naive or sophisticated end users exploit LINE application program (AP) as the instant messaging toolkit to conduct real-time communications including sending text messages or video clips. Unfortunately, this cutting-edge innovation has been taken advantage by the cybercrime syndicates, terrorists, or the extremists to fulfill their lucrative purposes. Hence, this research provides generic research methodologies for digital forensics experts to conduct whenever digital artifacts become mandatory in order to disclose some cybercrimes or the noncompliance of computer usage concerning LINE AP especially for the witness experts to testify in a court of law. On the other hand, this research paper pinpoints the volatile raw memory contains valuable and imperceptive digital artifacts that could reflect the interactions when LINE AP was utilized under Mac OS X.

Research SummaryWe found that romance fraud was rising year-on-year across every region in England and Wales, increasing 55% during the 3 years between October 2018 and October 2021. Fifty percent of all the romance fraud victims in the period resided in 17% of the places where romance fraud had occurred. A total of 439 locations (outward postcode areas) were identified as the power few in the first year of the data set. Of these 439 locations, 162 of them recurred in both of the following years, becoming chronic hot spot locations containing more than one in six of all reported romance fraud victims. The demography of victims in repeat locations differed considerably, but hot spots were more frequently predominantly populated by less affluent populations. Policy ImplicationsWe conclude that the current national one-size-fits-all fraud prevention approach may not be the most efficient or effective way to reach those victims who most require crime prevention advice. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, based in the City of London Police, could adopt a tailored approach to providing preventative information to local police forces based on the year-to-year patterns in crime and the associated intelligence provided by sociodemographic data sources such as Acorn.
As organizations accelerate digital transformation with mobile devices, cloud services, social media, and Internet of Things services, cybersecurity has become a key priority in enterprise risk management. While improving cybersecurity leads to higher levels of customer trust and increased revenue opportunities, rapidly evolving data protection and privacy regulations have complicated cybersecurity management. Against the backdrop of rapidly rising cyberbreaches and the emergence of novel cybersecurity technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, this article introduces a cyber risk management framework, discusses a cyber risk assessment process, and illustrates a continuous improvement of cybersecurity performance and cyberinvestment cost analysis with a real-world cybersecurity example.

"Various advantages offered by cloud computing business model has made it one of the most significant of current computing trends like personal, mobile, ubiquitous, cluster, grid, and utility computing models. These advantages have created complex issues for forensic investigators and practitioners for conducting digital forensic investigation in cloud computing environment. In the past few years, many researchers have contributed in identifying the forensic challenges, designing forensic frameworks, data acquisition methods for cloud computing systems. However, to date, there is no unique universally accepted forensic process model for cloud computing environment to acquire and analyze data available therein. This paper contributes in three specific areas to expedite research in this emerging field. First is designing a digital forensic architecture for cloud computing systems; second is evidence source identification, segregation and acquisition; and finally methods for partial analysis of evidence within and outside of a virtual machine (VM)."
Network forensics is an extension of the network security model, which traditionally emphasizes prevention and detection of network attacks. It addresses the need for dedicated investigative capabilities for investigation of malicious behavior in networks. Modern-day attackers tend to use sophisticated multi-stage, multihost attack techniques and anti-forensics tools to cover their attack traces. Due to the current limitations of intrusion detection and forensic analysis tools, reconstructing attack scenarios from evidence left behind by the attackers of an enterprise system is challenging. In particular, reconstructing attack scenarios by using the information from IDS alerts and system logs that have a large number of false positives is a big challenge. Many researchers have proposed to aggregate redundant alerts and correlate them to determine multi-step attacks [1]. This method is non-automated and rather ad-hoc. As an improvement, Wang at el. [7] proposed automating the process by using a fuzzy-rule based hierarchical reasoning framework to correlate alerts using so-called local rules and group them using so-called global rules. However, this approach falls apart when evidence is destroyed, and it does not assess the potential of the evidences admissibility so that the constructed attack scenario presented to a judge or jury has legal standing. In this talk, we will present a model [4] that systematically addresses how to resolve the above problems to reconstruct the attack scenario. These problems include a large amount of data including non-relevant data, missing evidence or evidence destroyed by anti-forensic techniques. Our system is based on a Prolog reasoning system MulVAL [6] using known vulnerability databases and an antiforensics database that we plan to extend to a standardized database like the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In this model, we use different methods, including mapping the evidence to system vulnerabilities, inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning to reconstruct attack scenarios. Besides, for the legal purpose, we codified the federal rules to this tool, aiming to help judge whether the evidence that is used to reconstruct the attack scenarios could be admissible in the court [5]. In addition, in order to help the investigators to quantify the probability of an attack path we use Bayesian Network to calculate the cumulative likelihood of the evidences. The goal of this research is to provide a tool that can reduce the investigators' time and effort in reaching definite conclusion about how an attack occurred. Also, this tool can be used to assist judge/jury or law students to better understand a multi-step, multihost attack towards an enterprise network by using a visual graph and probabilities. Our experimental results indicate that such a reasoning system can be useful for network forensics analysis.
"Identity-related crimes pose a significant problem to both the UK economy and also its citizens because they cause estimated annual losses of around 1.5billion pound. Not only do identity crimes cause considerable public concern, but they also create challenges for policing them; not least, because policing responses, in the broader regulatory sense, are often over-reactive or take the form of dramatic Public Relations gestures rather than coherent policing policy. Yet, the realities of identity-related crimes are quite different from the ways that they are perceived and even more important is that fact that this difference presents many challenges for those whose job is to police' them. This article will look at what identity crimes are and at the very real problems they pose for policing them as non-routine policing activities. The article will, firstly, map out identity crimes and outline the behaviours that we understand as identity crimes and their core characteristics. It will then consider how the characteristics map onto traditional police practice and consider some of the ways that the challenges have been addressed."
At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.
Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) face a challenging problem to detect the tool marks of Skype traffic. Analyzing digital packets is an essential job in digital forensics. This study collects these packets, traces their routings, analyzes the relevant information, and explores the tool mark identification of Skype packets. It uses experimental data on a personal computer, investigates the characteristics of Skype traffic, and provides a tool mark analysis of network traffic. The study can assist the investigator in identifying the suspect using a Skype communication application to commit the crime.
"Given the prevalence of violence in Ukrainian families, measures to prevent parental abusive treatment against children are urgent. It is important to study today's youth awareness about violence within families in order to enhance a culture of engagement with spouses and children in future. The aim of the study is to examine students` reflective experiences and their attitudes towards forms, frequency, causes and effects of parental abusive treatment. During the research the following methods were used step-bystep: theoretical analyses of scientific resources, anonymous questionnaire, quantitative and correlation analyses. According to result of survey 98 students who were interviewed, none of them fell victim of sexual abuse in their families. However, more than a half (51%) of the students surveyed experienced some forms of parental physical punishment. All the interviewed students encountered psychological cases of parental violence. The mostprevalent forms of parental abuse among the interviewees are criticism, negative comparison, emotional detachment, arrogance, intimidation, blackmail and humiliation. The most prevalent consequences of parental abuse among students are anxiety, low self-esteem, insecurity, impatience, suspiciousness, constraint in communication. Students agree that budget limitations, forced labor, criticism, spanking, emotional detachment, ignoring type of communication, reproach, blackmail are acceptable methods of punishment to use when raising their own children. These results clearly demonstrate the problem of the impact of parental abuse on children and its consequences in the future. A virtual dimension of the actualized problem is considered, namely: - virtualization of aggression and cruelty in the postmodern world. - the level of determining the factor of cruelty from the space of virtual culture. - the mirror image of everyday cruelty in the virtual environment; - the phenomenon of video games as a source and context of representation of the factor of cruelty in behavioral realities; - cybercrime as a virtualized result of cruelty in family and everyday realities. - futurological perspectives of virtualization of cruelty in communicative culture in general and in family relations in particular. The postmodern world is fundamentally different from the traditions and culture of the past, primarily due to the development of computer technologies and the virtualization of life in general. So, for example, virtual communities have become, in a certain way, another world, a second reality of life in general. And certain behavioral factors, in particular cruelty in the private environment, became a projection of such a phenomenon as cybercrime. Video games are a unique modern phenomenon, which multipolarly absorb all facets of human potential, communicative tendencies, behavioral and characterological factors, from the warmth of interpersonal relationships to the extreme degree of cruelty."
This study aims to understand communicative activities of an illicit cyber-trade community on an anonymous social platform, Reddit. Based on the communication-as-constitutive of organization (CCO) perspective, the study identifies participants with different levels of engagement, and examines how their discursive engagement collectively reflects the ways in which illicit market users co-orient themselves to respond to a crisis event (i.e., market shutdown). The empirical case for this study is a subreddit channel dedicated to what was once the largest dark web market: r/AlphabayMarket. We examine two month period's posting activities until market was permanently shut down in July 2017. Our analysis comprises three parts. First, a social network analysis was conducted to identify key and non-key players in the community. Second, a structural topic modeling was computed to inductively infer topic clusters. Third, posts were manually reviewed to articulate the process of co-orientation manifest in the results of topic modeling.
"Online child pornography is a repulsive reality which cannot be ignored; the biggest child pornography manufacturing ring in South African history was cracked with the arrest of eight family members. There are more than 116 000 Internet searches daily for child pornography. Pornography is no longer confined to consenting adults, children are not only being exposed to pornographic material but are increasingly being used as victims of child pornography. In South Africa, the Internet and Cell phone Pornography Bill tabled in 2010 aims to make it illegal for Internet and mobile phone service providers to distribute pornography or permit it to be distributed. The objective of the Bill is to protect children from child pornography and women from the indignity of being seen as objects of pornography. This paper takes as its focal point the continuing crisis which centres on the conceptual framework, the existing legislation regulating online child pornography and measures to curb infringement.

"This paper presents several scenarios where digital evidence can be collected from mobile devices, their legal value keeping untouched. The paper describes a robust methodology for mobile forensics developed through on-field experiences directly gained by the authors over the last 10 years and many real court cases. The results show that mobile forensics, digital analysis of smartphone Android or iOS can be obtained in two ways: on the one hand, data extraction must follow the best practice of the repeatability procedure; on the other hand, the extraction of the data must follow the best practice of the non-repeatability procedure. The laboratory study of the two methods for extracting digital data from mobile phones, for use as evidence in court trials, has shown that the same evidence can be obtained even when the procedure of unavailability of file mining activities has been adopted. Indeed, thanks to laboratory tests, the existence of multiple files frequently and continuously subjected to changes generated by the presence of several hashes found at forensic extractions conducted in very short moments of time (sometimes not exceeding 15 min) has been proven. If, on the other hand, the examination of a device is entrusted to a judicial police officer in order to conduct a forensic analysis to acquire data produced and managed by the user (such as images, audio, video, documents, SMS, MMS, chat conversations, address book content, etc.) we have sufficient grounds to believe that such examination can be organized according to the system of repeatable technical assessments."
Outside of criminology, dominant conceptions of postcolonial statehood in the Global South as 'fragile' or 'failed' have long been criticized. In criminology, however, the theoretical outcomes of this critique have been scarce. In this article we therefore ask how ideals and practices of transnational criminal justice are informed by and productive of specific (Global North) conceptions of statehood. Exploring encounters between transnational and local criminal justice in the context of international state-building in Mali and Liberia, we observe frictions in which statehood divergences and global hierarchies become apparent. Through penal aid, we argue, a particular kind of penal statehood is produced wherein the options of how to perform penality are increasingly limited by the embeddedness in global power asymmetries.
"Artificial intelligence (AI; broadly defined to include Machine Learning and Deep Learning) and automation are two current and reciprocal computing disciplines. As such, AI-powered software, programs, operating systems, and devices are developed on a massive scale to automate a wide variety of processes and operations. The principal aims of integrating AI and automation include efficiency, accuracy, and cost-reduction. While there is still an on-going cost associated with automation, the cost is typically many magnitudes smaller than the on-going costs incurred to get the job done manually, which increases the likelihood of generating a high return on investment. One emerging application of AI and automation is digital forensics. For example, US Federal and State Law Enforcement Agencies have started exploring the utility of AI-powered technology to make the job of digital forensics more impactful. This trend can maximize the accuracy of digital forensic investigations, enabling the resolution of more digital investigations. This article is categorized under: Digital and Multimedia Science > Cyber Threat Intelligence Digital and Multimedia Science > Artificial Intelligence Digital and Multimedia Science > Cybercrime Investigation"
The Internet of Things (IoT) connects physical and digital worlds with mobile devices, accompanied by a surge in cybersecurity issues. With the rapid adoption of mobile devices, mobile forensics emerges as a new interdisciplinary field that concerns many forms of sabotage and cybercrime in the context of mobile computing. One of the most common cyberattacks is tampering. Digital watermarking is a tamper-evident technique used to protect data integrity. In this paper, we present an antitamper image watermarking scheme designed for mobile communications with low computational cost. A reference matrix based on cellular network topology is introduced to guide the watermark embedding and extraction processes. This reference matrix serves as a lookup table to reduce computational complexity, thereby enabling efficient implementation on mobile devices. Our scheme is aimed at offering high accuracy in detecting and localizing tampered regions. We also achieve a high watermarking capacity while leaving the visual quality of the carrier images nearly unharmed. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our scheme against various types of simulated forgery including cropping and copy/paste attacks.
Research examining cybercrime and personality is a critical, but understudied topic. From an applied perspective, such research will inform better practice in cyber defense. It will also contribute to our theoretical and practical understanding of trait expression in a relatively unstructured environment. Building on Trait Activation Theory, we predict that the unstructured environment computer attacks will elicit individual differences in decision making that can be attributed (in part) to differences in personality traits. Here we examine the varying approaches that individuals high in different Dark Triad traits and deception strategies take in executing cyberattacks. Using a hypothetical game scenario, Study 1 found that long-term mimicry deception and Machiavellianism were strong predictors of stealthy attacks, whereas narcissism and psychopathy were associated with shorter term or aggressive (i.e., brute force) attacks. Study 2 replicated this general pattern of results in a realistic lab simulation. The findings speak to the differential nature of the Dark Triad in the unstructured environment of cyber-attacks. These findings also contribute to our knowledge of how different attacks may emanate from individuals with different manipulative personality traits.
Today, the volume of evidence collected per case is growing exponentially, to address this problem forensics investigators are looking for investigation process with tools built on new technologies like big data, cloud services and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Consequently, the accuracy of artifacts found also relies on the performance of techniques used, especially DL models. Recently, Deep Neural Nets (DNN) have achieved state of the art performance in the tasks of classification and recognition. In the context of digital forensics, DNN has been applied in the domains of cybercrime investigation such as child abuse investigations, malware classification, steganalysis and image forensics. However, the robustness of DNN models in the context of digital forensics is never studied before. Hence, in this research, we design and implement a domain independent Adversary Testing Framework (ATF) to test security robustness of black-box DNN's. By using ATF, we also methodically test a commercially available DNN service used in forensic investigations and bypass the detection, where published methods fail in control settings.
Introduction. The scale and destructive consequences of the unlawful impact on cyberspace is a key problem of modern geopolitics, and cyber reliability is recognized as one of the most important security priorities by the sub-jects of international relations. Problem Statement. Monitoring of cyber incidents and anomalies in information and communication systems and prompt response to risks determined by cyber threats require the development of a system of indicators and criteria for cybersecurity assessment. Purpose. Summarize the international experience of assessing the cybersecurity, to position countries by their level of development in the global space, to identify strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity management, and to ensure effective protection of cyberspace at the national level. Materials and Methods. Used the component indices of the international rankings characterizing the poten-tial of the digital economy (ICT IDI, NRI, EGDI) and the participation of countries in the field of cybersecurity (GCI and NCSI). Results. It has been argued that cybersecurity ratings play the role of a kind of identifier of the relative ad-vantages and vulnerabilities of the national cyber strategies, and indicate the need for their review in order to strengthen protection against cyber-attacks and improve the cyber risk management system. In countries with a high level of economic development, which is largely based on the contribution of IT tech-nologies to the national production, the cybersecurity potential is significantly higher, regardless of geolocation. The discovered correlation between GCI, information society development indices (IDI, NRI, EGDI) and GDP per capita confirms that the digital transformation of the economy and society acts as a key driver of economic development if the information-and cyber-security are assured only. The best practices are highlighted, and critically weak segments of the national cybersecurity are identified. Conclusions. Using the NCSI indicators, the preparedness of Georgia and Ukraine to prevent the implementa-tion of fundamental cyber threats and to manage cyber incidents and large-scale cyber crises is assessed.
As the technical skills and costs associated with the deployment of phishing attacks decrease, we are witnessing an unprecedented level of scams that push the need for better methods to proactively detect phishing threats. In this work, we explored the use of URLs as input for machine learning models applied for phishing site prediction. In this way, we compared a feature-engineering approach followed by a random forest classifier against a novel method based on recurrent neural networks. We determined that the recurrent neural network approach provides an accuracy rate of 98.7% even without the need of manual feature creation, beating by 5% the random forest method. This means it is a scalable and fast-acting proactive detection system that does not require full content analysis.
Over the last few years, exploit kits (EKs) have become the de facto medium for large-scale spread of malware. Drive-by download is the leading method that is widely used by EK flavors to exploit web-based client-side vulnerabilities. Their principal goal is to infect the victim's system with a malware. In addition, EK families evolve quickly, where they port zero-day exploits for brand new vulnerabilities that were never seen before and for which no patch exists. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for categorizing malware infection incidents conducted through EKs by leveraging the inherent overall URL patterns in the HTTP traffic chain. The proposed approach is based on the key finding that EKs infect victim systems using a specially designed chain, where EKs lead the web browser to download a malicious payload by issuing several HTTP requests to more than one malicious domain addresses. This practice in use enables the development of a system that is capable of clustering the responsible EK instances. The method has been evaluated with a popular and publicly available dataset that contains 240 different real-world infection cases involving over 2250 URLs, the incidents being linked with the 4 major EK flavors that occurred throughout the year 2016. The system achieves up to 93.7% clustering accuracy with the estimators experimented.
The vigorous development of e-commerce breeds cybercrime. Online payment fraud detection, a challenge faced by online service, plays an important role in rapidly evolving e-commerce. Behavior-based methods are recognized as a promising method for online payment fraud detection. However, it is a big challenge to build high-resolution behavioral models by using low-quality behavioral data. In this work, we mainly address this problem from data enhancement for behavioral modeling. We extract fine-grained co-occurrence relationships of transactional attributes by using a knowledge graph. Furthermore, we adopt the heterogeneous network embedding to learn and improve representing comprehensive relationships. Particularly, we explore customized network embedding schemes for different types of behavioral models, such as the population-level models, individual-level models, and generalized-agent-based models. The performance gain of our method is validated by the experiments over the real dataset from a commercial bank. It can help representative behavioral models improve significantly the performance of online banking payment fraud detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to realize data enhancement for diversified behavior models by implementing network embedding algorithms on attribute-level co-occurrence relationships.
The World Wide Web has become the most essential criterion for information communication and knowledge dissemination. It helps to transact information timely, rapidly and easily. Identity theft and identity fraud are referred as two sides of cybercrime in which hackers and malicious users obtain the personal data of existing legitimate users to attempt fraud or deception motivation for financial gain. E-Mails are used as phishing tools in which legitimate looking emails are sent making the genuine users identity with legitimate content with malicious URLs. It helps to steal consumers personal data such as user names, account numbers, passwords and other financial account credentials. Spam E-Mails emerges or transforms as Phishing mails. Spoofed Mails plays a vital role in which the hackers pretends to be a legitimate sender posing to be from a legitimate organization which divulges the user to give his personal credentials.

Computer crime has increased exponentially in recent years as hardware, software, and network resources become more affordable and available to individuals from all walks of life. Software piracy is one prevalent type of cybercrime and has detrimentally affected the economic health of the software industry. Moreover, piracy arguably represents a rend in the moral fabric associated with the respect of intellectual property and reduces the financial incentive of product creation and innovation. Deindividuation theory, originating from the field of social psychology, argues that individuals are extricated from responsibility for their actions simply because they no longer have an acute awareness of the identity of self and of others. That is, external and internal constraints that would typically regulate questionable behavior are rendered less effective via certain anonymizing and disinhibiting conditions of the social and environmental context. This exploratory piece seeks to establish the role of deindividuation in liberating individuals to commit software piracy by testing the hypothesis that persons who prefer the anonymity and pseudonymity associated with interaction on the Internet are more likely to pirate software. Through this research, it is hoped that the empirical identification of such a social psychological determinant will help further illuminate the phenomenon.
Violence against women is a problem worldwide, with economic costs ranging from 1% to 4% of global gross domestic product. During the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdowns, the United Nations coined the term the Shadow Pandemic to describe the increase in global violence against women. Here, using variation in the intensity of government-mandated lockdowns in India, we show that domestic violence complaints increase significantly in districts with the strictest lockdown rules. We find similarly large increases in cybercrime complaints. However, rape and sexual assault complaints decrease in districts with the strictest lockdowns, consistent with decreased female mobility in public spaces, public transport and workplaces where they might be at greater risk for rape and sexual assault. Medium-term analysis shows that increases in domestic violence complaints persist 1 year later, while other complaints related to rape, sexual assault and cybercrimes return to pre-lockdown levels. Lockdowns may help control disease, but also come with potential costs. Domestic violence complaints in India increased in districts with the strictest lockdown rules, and remained higher 1 year later, even after restrictions were loosened.
The Darkweb has become the largest repository of unauthorized information compared to the surface web because of its benefit of anonymity and privacy. With these anonymity and privacy features, the dark web is also becoming a safe place for illegal activities and hence an increase of dark web usage and size of the onion-based URLs. With the increasing use of dark web users, it is the need for cybercrime investigators across the globe to classify dark web data for understanding various illegal activities to control and categorize URLs hosting such illicit activities with feature engineering. In this research, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm is used to understand the algorithm's efficiency for a proposed model to classify dark web data with optimization techniques. Text-based keywords from more than 1800 websites were collected by applying feature engineering techniques and the system's performance was evaluated with the SVM approach. The results are very encouraging as the Precision, Recall, and F-measure values are 0.83, 0.90 & 0.96 achieved with a dataset of 1800 URLs.
Forensic document analysis has become an important aspect of investigation of many different kinds of crimes from money laundering to fraud and from cybercrime to smuggling. The current workflow for analysts includes powerful tools, such as Palantir and Analyst's Notebook, for moving from evidence to actionable intelligence and tools for finding documents among the millions of files on a hard disk, such as Forensic Toolkit (FTK). Analysts often leave the process of sorting through collections of seized documents to filter out noise from actual evidence to highly labor-intensive manual efforts. This paper presents the Redeye Analysis Workbench, a tool to help analysts move from manual sorting of a collection of documents to performing intelligent document triage over a digital library. We will discuss the tools and techniques we build upon in addition to an in-depth discussion of our tool and how it addresses two major use cases we observed analysts performing. Finally, we also include a new layout algorithm for radial graphs that is used to visualize clusters of documents in our system.
The role of citizens in securing their smart homes is critical. We develop a research model, based on health related fear appeal frameworks, to examine the factors that motivate users to take security precautions. Our model synthesizes the protection motivation theory and the extended parallel process model. This synthesis distinguishes between users' danger-control and fear-control coping mechanisms. Further, we draw from the criminology literature to refine fear's compatibility with information threats as opposed to health ones. We also develop and incorporate the Internet of Self into our model to account for smart homes' personal relevance to users. The theoretical foundation, contributions and hypotheses are discussed.
study aimed to determine an efficient framework that caters to the security and consumer satisfaction for digital wallet systems. A quantitative online survey was carried out to test whether the six factors (i.e., transaction speed, authentication, encryption mechanisms, software performance, privacy details, and information provided) positively or negatively impact customer satisfaction. This questionnaire was divided into two sections: the respondents' demographic data and a survey on security factors that influence customer satisfaction. The questionnaires were distributed to the National University of Malaysia's professors and students. A sample of 300 respondents undertook the survey. The survey results suggested that many respondents agreed that the stated security factors influenced their satisfaction when using digital wallets. Previous studies indicated that financial security, privacy, system security, cybercrime, and trust impact online purchase intention. The proposed framework in this research explicitly covers the security factors of the digital wallet. This study may help digital wallet providers understand the customer's perspective on digital wallet security aspects, therefore motivating providers to implement appropriately designed regulations that will attract customers to utilize digital wallet services. Formulating appropriate security regulations will generate long-term value, leading to greater digital wallet adoption rates.
Online anonymity is considered as one of the great gifts of the Internet, but it also brings dangers to society, such as cybercrime, online sexual abuse and bullying, and love scams. Many people are fond of chatting online to make new friends, but how can they be sure that the person sitting behind the other computer is really the person they claim to be? By studying stylometry and keystroke dynamics features from chat data, it is feasible to reveal the actual gender of an online user. In this paper, we examined stylometry and keystroke dynamics features from chat data, and proposed a Random Forest based gender prediction approach by analyzing these features. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a data acquisition was conducted to capture the keystroke dynamics and text information when participants were chatting remotely via Skype. All participants were invited to chat freely on any topic they prefered in order to get to know each other. Based on our experimental result, the proposed approach achieved 72% prediction accuracy by analyzing on this free-text data captured only in 15 minutes.
With the popularity of computer and Internet, a growing number of criminals have been using the Internet to distribute a wide range of illegal materials and false information globally in an anonymous manner, making criminal identity tracing difficult in the cybercrime investigation process. Consequently, automatic authorship attribution of online messages becomes increasingly crucial for forensic investigation. Although researchers have got many achievements, the accuracies of authorship attribution with tens or thousands of candidate are still relatively poor which is generally among 20%similar to 40%, and cannot be used as evidence in forensic investigation. Instead of asserting that a given text was written by a given user, this paper proposes a novel authorship attribution model combining both profile-based and instance-based approaches to reduce the size of the candidate authors to a small number and narrow the scope of investigation with a high level of accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a blog corpus with thousands of candidate authors. The experimental results show that our algorithm can successfully output a small number of candidate authors with high accuracy.
The extraordinary current craze around NFTs reflects their perceived value as a technological development that can bring greater certainty to questions of ownership and authenticity in fields like art and other collectibles. This is, among other things, the promise of crime prevention through technology, as ownership and authenticity are in the art world closely tied to criminal legal matters like theft, handling stolen goods and fraud. The crime prevention promise looks to fall flat though, as the technology seems to be less capable of delivering these benefits than has been assumed by its promoters. Much of the attraction of NFTs is therefore not actually based on effective crime prevention, but rather on hype. This paper explores the hype, and its relationship to the crime prevention promise of NFTs, through the lens of 'the social lives of things'. We argue that as well as social lives, things have criminal lives. Analysis sensitive to the criminal lives of things finds an NFT trading scene heated by emotion: excitement, attraction, temptation, speculative euphoria and acquisitive, possessive sentiment. This creates a sense of object agency more active than the cold traditional vision of material structure presented in standard criminological treatments of things-in-the-world as passive opportunity structures. The hyped NFT market trades in affecting objects that create crime in emotional as well as structural ways. We therefore arrive at a conclusion opposite to starting assumptions: far from preventing crime, NFTs are making it.

Technical Support Scams delivered through malicious webpages and linked advertisements are an endemic problem on the web. To avoid detection, scammers systematically vary the URLs, web page designs, and phone numbers of scam delivery. We describe a web -scale pipeline powered by Cloud AI services that continuously detects and links evidence of such scams. By integrating this evidence in a graph structure and exposing it for forensic analysis in a user interface, we enable investigators and law enforcement partners to track the evolving scope and sophistication of scam operations. This approach automates and scales investigative tradecraft that contributed to major enforcement actions by the FTC in 2016. From 2016-2018, it helped reduce consumer exposure to such scams by 5 percent.
The term biosocial in this study stands for a social variable that can potentially influence violence or cybercrime through a biological mechanism. This study adopted Owen (2014a)'s Genetic-Social and meta-theoretical framework to conceptualize cybercrimes and build a model of cyber violence that could help in predicting aggressive online behavior and the role of the state legislatures to prevent these types of cybercrimes. The study adopted a historical-normative research method which involved documentation search and archive segmentation according to the research variables. In this qualitative study, the data was collected from various sources including cyber law archives, databases and repositories. The data was analyzed with two research methods: system analysis and synthesis of internal and external documentation on the topic under study. The findings of the study revealed that cybercrimes and the related delinquent and criminal behavior are the results of the interaction between the human biological predispositions and social interactions. The study recommends establishing a National Cybersecurity Authority or A national level Cyber Security Guidance bureau to develop, implement, and supervise administrative and legal mechanism and strategies.
This paper gives a loom towards the growing spatial resolution necessary to beat the limitations of the imaging technology in surveillance and security disciplines. It has been observed that metropolis cities worldwide invest huge sum of money in surveillance camera system but few are closely observing the benefits and the costs of those investments and to measure the overall impact of surveillance cameras on crime rates. The low resolution coupled with poor quality optics is not be enough to identify the subject of interest in crowd, from a distance, in bad weather and any other limiting factor. In this paper we have introduced multi-frame super-resolution technique that does not require explicit motion estimation and will be useful for producing imagery evidence that the police might reasonably accept as proof of someone's identity. Mostly the research is done in this area by taking a SR image and then after adding their own noise patterns where as our algorithm are working on actual LR images of surveillance camera and getting a SR image while removing the original blur and noise. Our algorithm requires the training set of Low resolution (LR) images from a still camera to produce High resolution (HR) image data and enhances it using anisotropic Diffusion and De-noising. In the image based representations, this technique of super resolution provides a great step towards resolution independence. The application of this method was successfully demonstrated for the restoration from a short low resolution set of images into a super resolved image. This super resolution algorithm works best when the Diffusion is applied and noise reduction filters are applied.
Text authentication serves a vital role in the defense of digital identity and content against various types of cybercrime. The use of a digital signature is a common cryptographic technique for text authentication. Linguistic steganography can be applied to further conceal a digital signature within the corresponding text to facilitate data management. However, steganographic distortion lurking in the text, albeit almost imperceptible, has the potential to cause automatic computing machinery to make biased decisions. This has led to an interest in the pursuit of reversibility, the ability to reverse a steganographic process and remove distortion. In this article, we propose a reversible steganographic system for natural language text. We use a pre-trained transformer neural network for masked language modeling and embed messages in a reversible manner via predictive word substitution. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive steganographic route by taking account of predictive uncertainty, which is quantified based on a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning. Experimental results show that the proposed steganographic system can attain a proper balance between capacity, imperceptibility, and reversibility with close semantic and sentimental similarities between cover and stego texts.
Any digital device generates information that may become valuable evidence in the event of a cybercrime incident, security incident, or cyber-attack, but often the collection, management and preservation of this information is not done properly. In the legal field, once information has been obtained from the devices, it is very important to maintain it and preserve it from the initial time, through investigation, until the trial or investigation is concluded, and to preserve it for long term use, in order to avoid it to be tainted, damaged, changed or manipulated and so assuring reliability through the whole process. Preservation of digital evidence is an important aspect when deciding its admissibility in a trial in process, or in any future process, reopened by appeal, or as source of historical information. This paper contains a review of the state of the art about digital preservation in institutions dedicated to criminal investigation, analyzing concepts, related projects, tools and legal support in this area. The motivation of this paper is the idea of finding how close we are to having a framework useful to preserve digital evidence, ensuring integrity, hence increasing its admissibility, and supported by long term preservation technique.
Phishing is an attack that deceit online users by means of masquerading as a genuine website to pilfer their classified or personal information. This is one among the recognized cybercrime. Disparate phishing website detection systems were recently developed for the purpose of detecting the phishing websites. However, they fail to attain the desired output and are suffered from countless drawbacks like lower accuracy and higher training time. For trouncing such drawbacks, this paper proposes an effectual Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL)-centric Phishing Detection System (PDS) using the MCS-DNN classifier. At first, pre-processing is done on the input dataset for ameliorating its quality. Subsequently, clustering and feature selection (FS) are performed to lessen the processing time and elevate the accuracy using CoK-means and CM-WOA, respectively. The features which are chosen during FS are fed into the MCS-DNN classifier, which classifies the legitimate websites and phishing websites. Lastly, the K-fold cross-validations (KCV) are employed for effectively predicting the proposed system's accurateness. The outcomes highlight the robustness and predictive ability of the proposed PDS to distinguish the phishing as well as legitimate sites.
Speedy development has been witnessed in communication technologies and the adoption of the Internet across the world. Information dissemination is the primary goal of these technologies. One of the rapidly developing nations in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, where the use of communication technologies, including mobile and Internet, has drastically risen in recent times. These advancements are relatively new to the region when contrasted to developed nations. Thus, offenses arising from the adoption of these technologies may be new to Saudi Arabians. This study examines cyber security awareness among Saudi Arabian citizens in distinct settings. A comparison is made between the cybersecurity policy guidelines adopted in Saudi Arabia and three other nations. This review will explore distinct essential elements and approaches to mitigating cybercrimes in the United States, Singapore, and India. Following an analysis of the current cybersecurity framework in Saudi Arabia, suggestions for improvement are determined from the overall findings. A key objective is enhancing the nationwide focus on efficient safety and security systems. While the participants display a clear knowledge of IT, the surveyed literature shows limited awareness of the risks related to cyber security practices and the role of government in promoting data safety across the Internet. As the findings indicate, proper frameworks regarding cyber security need to be considered to ensure that associated threats are mitigated as Saudi Arabia aspires to become an efficient smart nation.
The computer-controlled nature of contemporary road vehicles has reached a point where the in-vehicle computer control system manages a significant proportion of motor vehicle dynamic operation. In highly automated vehicles the automated driving system (ADS), undertakes the dynamic driving functions and overarching responsibility for the vehicle's journey. Central to Australia's future road transport system is the reliable operation of ADSs. ADS are networked, transmitting, and receiving data. This is a weakness that could be exploited to cause harm to individuals or the transport system. This article examines whether the Commonwealth criminal law is adequate for protecting against, or deterring from, unauthorised interference with ADSs. Three scenarios of interference are investigated. Scenario 1 is the intentional unauthorised interference with an ADS to cause harm. Scenario 2 involves unknowingly uploading of software containing harmful malware to an ADS. Scenario 3 is a third party installing unauthorised spyware on an ADS. This article argues that overall Commonwealth criminal law, specifically the cybercrime offences relating to unauthorised and malicious interference with computer systems, appear able to apply to various forms of interference with ADSs.
Previous empirical work has shown that the inclusion of low self:control in multiple regression models reduces the statistically significant independent effects of gender on general crime and delinquency to non-significant levels, even when controlling for known theoretical predictors of crime. In support of Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) claims, this work has also shown that opportunity interacts with low self-control in explaining deviant behavior. To date though, the relationship between gender, opportunity, and self-control in explaining cybercrime is still relatively unknown. Using a sample of Korean Adolescents (N = 1,091), the current study attempts to fill these gaps in the literature by examining the effects of opportunity and low self-control in relation to gendered disparities in rates of online harassment. Inconsistent with the theory, findings suggest that girls and boys report similar levels of self-control and that LSC interacts with opportunity to negatively predict online harassment. However, consistent with general theory of crime, results show that opportunity and LSC are significant predictors of online harassment in separate gender models while controlling for a host of other theoretical predictors of crime and delinquency.
"Thousands of cyber-attacks (fraudulent online activities to acquire users' sensitive information via email, during online transactions, live video streaming, online gaming and browsing) are launched every day against Internet users across the world. To prevent these attacks, researchers have responded with a number of protection systems. Currently, the methods which cyber-attackers use to conduct attacks is associated with exploiting humans. Such attacks are recorded more frequently than before, and they are more challenging to control. Traditional security countermeasures are unable to prevent breaches targeting the human element. This paper describes the state of the art of cyber security attacks, countermeasures, and protection tools related to everyday online activities. It provides a useful cyber-attack taxonomy and classification which helps to involve in a protection process to identify attacks and measures for cyber security. Existing protection schemes that target the cyber threats and risks are evaluated against three of our criteria for an effective measure: resilience to cyber-attacks' countermeasures; real-time support and needs-based action; and training and educational materials to increase users' awareness of cybercrimes. Potential features of smart solutions to cybercrime are also identified."
Over the past several years there has been a noticeable rise in the number of reported targeted attacks, which are also commonly referred to as advanced persistent threats (APTs). This is seen by security experts as a landscape shift from a world dominated by widespread malware that infect indiscriminately, to a more selectively targeted approach with higher gain. One thing that is clear about targeted attacks is that they are difficult to detect, and not much research has been conducted so far in detecting these attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel system called SPuNge that processes threat information collected on the users' side to detect potential targeted attacks for further investigation. We use a combination of clustering and correlation techniques to identify groups of machines that share a similar behavior with respect to the malicious resources they access and the industry in which they operate (e.g., oil & gas). We evaluated our system against real data collected by an antivirus vendor from over 20 million customers installations worldwide. Our results show that our approach works well in practice and is helpful in assisting security analysts in cybercrime investigations.
Phishing attacks are a type of cybercrime that has grown in recent years. It is part of social engineering attacks where an attacker deceives users by sending fake messages using social media platforms or emails. Phishing attacks steal users' information or download and install malicious software. They are hard to detect because attackers can design a phishing message that looks legitimate to a user. This message may contain a phishing URL so that even an expert can be a victim. This URL leads the victim to a fake website that steals information, such as login information, payment information, etc. Researchers and engineers work to develop methods to detect phishing attacks without the need for the eyes of experts. Even though many papers discuss HTML and URL-based phishing detection methods, there is no comprehensive survey to discuss these methods. Therefore, this paper comprehensively surveys HTML and URL phishing attacks and detection methods. We review the current state-of-art deep learning models to detect URL-based and hybrid-based phishing attacks in detail. We compare each model based on its data preprocessing, feature extraction, model design, and performance.
Recently cognitive radio technology gets attention to enhance the performance of smart grid communication networks. In this paper, we present a cognitive radio enabled smart grid architecture. We then discuss major cyber security challenges in smart grid deployment and additional challenges introduced by cognitive radio technology. Spectrum sensing is one of the important aspect for opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio enabled smart grid networks. Cooperative spectrum sensing can improve the sensing performance in which multiple cognitive radio users cooperate to sense primary user bands. However, cooperative spectrum sensing is vulnerable to incumbent emulation and spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. Thus, we propose a two-stage scheme for defense against SSDF attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed two-stage scheme can identify and exclude the attackers accurately.
Government agencies and standard setters require organizations operating in critical infrastructure sectors to disclose cybersecurity incidents, yet little is known about whether organizations report these incidents to law enforcement. This study examines this issue based on data from the 2017-2021 periods of the Canadian Survey of Cybersecurity and Cybercrime administered to Canadian organizations. We assessed the effects of governance determinants along with cyber incidents and their impacts using partial least squares equation modelling to identify the relationships between these factors and cybersecurity incidents reported to police services. To conceptualize these relationships, we developed a framework based on resource-dependence theory, protection motivation theory, and previous empirical evidence. The overall governance determinants as well as the impacts of the incidents explained 51% of the intention to report cybersecurity incidents to police, and the intensity of the impacts explained 30% of these intentions to signal incidents to law enforcement. The results also revealed that the intensity of cyber incident impacts dictates the attitudes of organizations towards reporting digital attacks. This study makes a significant theoretical contribution to the information security literature and has practical implications for standard setters and government agencies that aim to combat cybersecurity incidents.
Critical infrastructure in South Africa remains highly vulnerable to cybercrime threats due to a poor cyber-crime fighting capacity and a lack of a strong cybersecurity policy. South Africa appears to have fallen behind in securing and protecting cyberspace, considering the country's dependability as well as the interconnectedness to the internet. Globally, the water and wastewater sector were ranked number four in the global security incidents. This study presents the findings of a systematic literature review conducted to assess the cybersecurity knowledge necessary for a general employee in the water sector. The study proposes a framework for determining the minimum knowledge that a general employee in the water sector should have. The frameworks start by defining the eight different types of cybersecurity challenges, then move on to mitigation strategies for dealing with such attacks. Several approaches and strategies were provided for mitigating various cybersecurity challenges. To deal with such risks, mitigations such as cybersecurity knowledge and skills, cybersecurity awareness, and cybersecurity training were proposed. The strategies for developing knowledge to deal with various sorts of dangers were provided at both the individual and organizational levels.
Cybercrime has become a big money business with sensitive data being a hot commodity on the dark web. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a filesystem (DcyFS) capable of curtailing data theft and ensuring file integrity protection by providing subject-specific views of the filesystem. The deceptive filesystem transparently creates multiple levels of stacking to protect the base filesystem and monitor file accesses, hide and redact sensitive files with baits, and inject decoys onto fake system views purveyed to untrusted subjects, all while maintaining a pristine state to legitimate processes. A novel security domain model groups applications into filesystem views and eliminates the need for filesystem merging. Our prototype implementation leverages a kernel hot-patch to seamlessly integrate the new filesystem module into live and existing environments. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through extensive performance benchmarks and use cases on real malware samples, including ransomware, rootkits, binary modifiers, back-doors, and library injectors. Our results show that DcyFS adds no significant performance overhead to the filesystem, preserves the filesystem data, and offers a potent new tool to characterize the impact of malicious activities and expedite forensic investigations.
Email phishing is a serious and potentially catastrophic threat to organisations and individuals. Understanding what factors may influence individual susceptibility to phishing attacks is essential to protecting against cybercrime. We investigated the potential interplay between conscientiousness and cue utilisation in individuals' ability to accurately differentiate between phishing and legitimate emails. University students (N = 255) completed a phishing detection task, the Mini International Personality Item Pool, and the phishing edition of the Expert Intensive Skill Evaluation (2.0) battery. After, they were sent simulated phishing emails to their student email address. A Signal Detection Theory approach revealed that higher cue utilisation was associated with a greater ability to tell whether an e-mail was phishing or not in the detection task. For the simulated phishing emails, participants with lower conscientiousness were more likely to click an embedded link in an unsophisticated phishing email, however cue utilisation had no association with email engagement in a naturalistic setting. The findings provide insight into why some people are more susceptible to phishing scams and reveal important differences in phishing sensitivity as a function of context, which has implications to interventions.
Payload attribution systems (PAS) are one of the most important tools of network forensics for detecting an offender after the occurrence of a cybercrime. A PAS stores the network traffic history in order to detect the source and destination pair of a certain data stream in case a malicious activity occurs on the network. The huge volume of information that is daily transferred in the network means that the data stored by a PAS must be as compact and concise as possible. Moreover, the investigation of this large volume of data for a malicious data stream must be handled within a reasonable time. For this purpose, several techniques based on storing a digest of traffic using Bloom filters have been proposed in the literature. The false positive rate of existing techniques for detecting cybercriminals is unacceptably high, i.e., many source and destination pairs are falsely determined as malicious, making it difficult to detect the true criminal. In order to ameliorate this problem, we have proposed a solution based on compressed bitmap index tables and traffic downsampling. Our analytical evaluation and experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the false positive rate.
Cyberspace operates on a geographically borderless platform, thus often rendering national laws ineffective in regulating the impact of cyber-related activities outside South African borders. Recognising this issue, South Africa adopted the Cybercrimes Act, which permits the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction over trans-national cyber-related offences. The enforcement and effectiveness of extra-territorial jurisdiction and extradition law have, however, proven to be challenging and controversial in the international sphere. Issues such as internet fragmentation, contrasting municipal laws, and uncoordinated regulatory actions across state boundaries have undermined existing provisions regulating trans-national cybercrimes. These issues are furthered by the increased recognition of human rights, such as the right to privacy, which has deterred international cooperation and collaboration as states are subsequently required to subject their own citizens and entities to increased interception and scrutiny. The main thesis of this investigation is aimed at reviewing the practical implications surrounding the enforcement of extra-territorial jurisdiction and extradition law over trans-national cybercrimes. To this end, states are implored to develop both domestic and multilateral cybercrime laws and to improve existing enforcement mechanisms outlined in extradition law and mutual assistance agreements.
Cyberbullying is a critical issue in society worldwide, however in Ecuador is not given necessary importance to mitigate this cybercrime. It has been proposed to develop an exhaustive analysis of the laws that are currently considered to sanction cyberbullying when denouncing this fact. The deductive method and exploratory research were employed to make the analysis of the information consulted from the various sources that are obtained on the network about the topic discussed. The investigation revealed how cyberbullying cases arise, from which it is obtained that only 0.07% have been reported, with this result it can be deduced that the number of reported cases is very low in relation to the total number of cellphones activated in Ecuador and people who may be victims of this cyber-crime. In addition, a Criminal Process Diagram was obtained that determines the sequence of how the judicial process work. The applied method resulted the following: Can be created a law project that battles each type of derived cyberbullying. It was concluded that several institutions in Ecuador work together with organizations to prevent cyberbullying, however, when this happens, the laws are not enough to punish the act.
"The high utilization rate of mobile devices highlights the problem of vulnerability. As a result, new cybercrime techniques are created, in response to which new forensic techniques must be created, so we can deduct the importance of this paper. For some years now, there has been a significant growth in the use of mobile devices in daily life, since they allow to carry personal data in a practical, easy and comfortable way. These data are, in many cases, the target of malicious people, who, taking advantage of the vulnerabilities that these devices present, are capable of illegal actions, usually for unlawful purposes. The current research proposes, using a comparative method to allow us to formulate a forensic analysis to mobile devices with Android operating system; based on the chain of custody guidelines, compliance stages, and phases and to detect findings, nonconformities, locate vulnerabilities. Based on this process we can determine the origin of the leading causes of different types of events or crimes committed from a mobile device. Additionally, using a decision matrix, the best software for performing the forensic analysis is chosen and using Balanced Scorecard, indicators are evaluated."
Real-time prediction of domain names that are generated using the Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) is a challenging cyber security task. Scope to collect the vast amount of data for training favored data-driven techniques and deep learning architectures have the potential to address this challenge. This paper proposes a deep learning framework using long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for prediction of the domain names that are generated using the DGAs. Binary classification had benign and DGA domain names and multiclass classification was performed using 20 different DGAs. For the binary classification, LSTM model gave accuracy of 98.7% and 71.3% on two different test data sets and for the multi-class classification, it gave accuracy of 68.3% and 67.0% respectively. Two diversified data sets were used to analyze the robustness of the LSTM architecture.
With the increasing usage of information technology on the criminal side, the digital forensic analysis, especially multimedia forensics, becomes an emerging technique for cybercrime investigators to improve examination efficiency. The study focuses on the digital triage problem for evidence location during the automatic forensic process. After defining the multi-scale knowledge base for storing digital forensic investigators' prior knowledge, a variable scale case-based reasoning method (VSCBR) is proposed to support investigators predicting evidential areas. The variable-scale clustering algorithm based on the scale transformation strategy (VSC-STS) is also put forward, which could identify highly similar past cases containing candidate evidence in the case reuse and revise phase. A case study is established using a real 15.9 GB bidding case dataset, which contains both text bidding documents and image technical drawings. Numerical experimental results show that the validation of the proposed VSC-STS is significantly improved compared with the traditional single-scale clustering algorithm, and it is insensitive to the initial parameter threshold. Moreover, the proposed method VSCBR is able to help investigators locate suspicious rule-violating evidences in practice. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
"For nearly a decade, security researchers have highlighted the grave risk presented by Internet-connected Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Predictions of targeted and indiscriminate attacks have yet to materialise despite continued growth of a vulnerable population of devices. We investigate the missing attacks against ICS, focusing on large-scale attacks enabled by Internet-connected populations. We fingerprint and track more than 10 000 devices over four years to confirm that the population is growing, continuously-connected, and unpatched. We also track 150 000 botnet hosts, monitor 120 global ICS honeypots, and sift 70 million underground forum posts to show that the cybercrime community has little competence or interest in the ICS domain. Attackers may be dissuaded by the high cost of entry, the fragmented ICS population, and limited onboard resources; however, this justification is incomplete. We use a series of case studies to develop a security economics model for large-scale attacks against Internet-connected populations in general, and use it to explain both the current lack of interest in ICS and the features of Industry 4.0 that will make the domain more accessible and attractive to attackers."
Cyber-safety behaviors are important in preventing the loss of an individual's digital assets and ensuring the safety of important daily online activities. Individuals' cyber-safety is also critical for national cybersecurity. The issue is highly relevant for Israel, a country that relies on the digital capabilities of its workers for its major technology industries and is also often a target of cyberwarfare and cybercrime attacks. The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of cyber-safety behavior. We investigate the role of age, gender and education in the use of safety-related digital skills and antivirus software. Using a 2014 survey of a national sample of Internet users in Israel (N=1850), we found that age, gender, education and quality of access are associated with the level of users' digital security skills. In addition, these skills and the frequency of conducting financial activities online are the main determinants of antivirus behaviors. Our results expand the understanding of cyber-safety by showing that social and digital disparities are reproduced in the use of measures to prevent online threats, putting the digitally disadvantaged at greater risk of becoming victims of online threats.
Phishing is an illegal cybercrime, wherein a target gets victimized for sacrificing their personal and corporate information. It is one of the most straightforward forms of cyber-attack for hackers, as well as one of the simplest for victims to fall for. It can also provide hackers with the required information that are needed to access their targets' personal and corporate accounts. For the past decade, machine-learning techniques have become consistent standards for classifying phishing and legitimate URLs. But deep learning algorithms have the advantage of automatic extraction of complex features and characterization of handling massive data. Considering the above-listed advantages, this work provides state-of-the-art accuracy in the detection of malicious URLs using recurrent neural networks (RNN). Unlike previous studies, which looked at online content, URLs, and traffic numbers, this work aims to focus only on the text in the URL which makes it quicker, and thereby zero-day assaults could be caught at the earliest. The RNN has been optimized so that it might be utilized on tiny devices like Mobiles, and Raspberry Pi without sacrificing the inference time.
The COVID19 pandemic situation has opened a wide range of opportunities for cyber-criminals, who take advantage of the anxiety generated and the time spent on the Internet, to undertake massive phishing campaigns. Although companies are adopting protective measures, the psychological traits of the victims are still considered from a very generic perspective. In particular, current literature determines that the model proposed in the Big-Five personality traits (i.e., Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) might play an important role in human behaviour to counter cybercrime. However, results do not provide unanimity regarding the correlation between phishing susceptibility and neuroticism. With the aim to understand this lack of consensus, this article provides a comprehensive literature review of papers extracted from relevant databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science). Our results show that there is not a well-established psychological theory explaining the role of neuroticism in the phishing context. We sustain that non-representative samples and the lack of homogeneity amongst the studies might be the culprits behind this lack of consensus on the role of neuroticism on phishing susceptibility.
Visualizing digital evidence in an easy and constructive manner is a major problem because of the advanced techniques for hiding, wiping, encrypting and deleting digital data developed during the last few years. To tackle this problem, a system for visualizing digital data in 3-Dimensional (3D) mode has been developed. XML was used as a common language to allow fine-grained management of digital data with flexibility and ease. The extensibility of the implementation makes it particularly suitable as a research and development platform in the sector of open source computer forensics tools for the future. This article examines real-life problems that benefit from using this tool in a congenial and constructive manner to validate its key underlining concept. The design decisions that have been taken in producing the system architecture, and the features it supports are elaborated upon. To determine the effectiveness of the tool, an actual case study is presented which examines the results of the tool and why it is necessary to go for an open source model as a standard. The paper concludes with performance measurements of the tool and suggests possible extensions to make the tool even smarter. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.
Steganography is a promising technique for covert communications. However, illegal usage of this technique would facilitate cybercrime activities and thereby pose a great threat to information security. Therefore, it is crucial to study its countermeasure, namely, steganalysis. In this paper, we aim to present an efficient steganalysis method for detecting adaptive-codebook based steganography in adaptive multi-rate (AMR) speech streams. To achieve this goal, we first design a new low-dimensional feature set for steganalysis, including an improved calibrated Markov transition probability matrix for the second-order difference of pitch delay values (IC-MSDPD) and the probability distribution of the odevity for pitch delay values (PDOEPD). The dimension of the proposed feature set is 14, far smaller than the feature set in the state-of-the-art steganalysis method. Employing the new feature set, we further present a steganalysis scheme for AMR speech based on support vector machines. The presented scheme is evaluated with a large number of AMR-encoded speech samples, and compared with the state-of-the-art one. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective, and outperforms the state-of-the-art one in both detection accuracy and computational overhead.
"Authorship Attribution, (AA) is a process of determining a particular document is written by which author among a list of suspected authors. Authorship attribution has been the problem from last six decades; when there were handwritten documents needed to be identified for the genuine author. Due to the technology advancement and increase in cybercrime and unlawful activities, this problem of AA becomes forth most important to trace out the author behind online messages. Over the past, many years research has been conducted to attribute the authorship of an author on the basis of their writing style as all authors possess different distinctiveness while writing a piece of document. This paper presents a comparative study of various machine learning approaches on different feature sets for authorship attribution on short text. The Twitter dataset has been used for comparison with varying sample size of a dataset of 10 prolific authors with various combinations of feature sets. The significance and impact of combinations of features while inferring different stylometric features has been reflected. The results of different approaches are compared based on their accuracy and precision values."
Web applications are one of the mostly attacked platforms today, and because of that new ways to break into the web applications are being invented almost on a daily basis, allowing attackers to steal user's personal data, credit card numbers, and conduct many other frauds related to data and applications hosted on the Internet servers and databases. Some of the reasons that web applications are constantly attacked is 24/7 availability, mix of technologies used to provide needed functionality, interesting data in the backend databases and easy way to avoid punishment for crimes committed against web sites and website users/owners. There is also an aspect related to cybercrime and cyber warfare that is marching throughout the planet in the last few years, exposing more and more personal data in highly sophisticated and targeted attacks. This paper will try to summarize few different ways that web application could be written in order to identify, isolate and track the hacker during the attack process. The concept presented in this paper is so called honeytoken - a value the application is using in databases, files, parameters, etc., which should never be changed or touched by the application in normal application lifecycle.
Today, phishing attacks represent one of the biggest security threats targeting users of the digital world. They consist of an attempt to steal sensitive information, such as a user?s identity or credit and debit card details, using various methods that include fake emails, fake websites, and fake social media messages. Protecting the user?s security and privacy therefore becomes complex, especially when those users are children. Currently, children are participating in Internet activity more frequently than ever before. This activity includes, for example, online gaming, communication, and schoolwork. However, children tend to have a less well-developed knowledge of privacy and security concepts, compared to adults. Consequently, they often become victims of cybercrime. In this paper, the effects of security awareness on users who are children are investigated, looking at their ability to detect phishing attacks in social media. In this approach, two Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of security awareness on WhatsApp application users in their daily communication. The results of the Experiments revealed that phishing awareness training has a significant positive effect on the ability of children using WhatsApp to identify phishing messages and thereby avoid attacks.
Network attacks have been around since the beginning of the Internet and they are still relevant due to the numerous attempts of independent hackers, cybercrime organizations and state-sponsored hacking squads to intrude into others computer networks. Similarly, the industry and academia have been providing constantly evolving solutions to try to thwart the ever-sophisticated network attack techniques. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning have shown promising results for detecting and preventing network attacks. In this paper, we investigate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network attack detection. Our goal is to find the optimal values for network attack detection by fine-tuning different LSTM hyper-parameters: optimizers, loss functions, learning rates and activation functions, and by comparing their performance by using the CICIDS2017 labeled dataset. Our results show that LSTM can effectively detect the network attacks with high accuracy and reasonable detection rates. With the optimized hyper-parameter values, the proposed LSTM model can detect DoS attacks with an effective detection accuracy of 99.08% and a detection rate of 0.93. We achieved BoT, DDoS, and port scan attacks detection accuracy of 99.54% and detection rate of 0.84.
In today's online forums and marketplaces cybercrime activity can often be found lurking in plain sight behind legitimate posts. Most popular criminology techniques are either manually intensive, and so do not scale well, or focus on statistical summaries across websites and can miss infrequent behaviour patterns. We present an inter-disciplinary (computer science, criminology and conservation science) socio-technical artificial intelligence (AI) approach to information extraction from the long tail of online forums around internet-facilitated illegal trades of endangered species. Our methodology is highly iterative, taking entities of interest (e.g. endangered plant species, suspects, locations) identified by a criminologist and using them to direct computer science tools including crawling, searching and information extraction over many steps until an acceptable resulting intelligence package is achieved. We evaluate our approach using two case study experiments, each based on a one-week duration criminology investigation (aided by conservation science experts) and evaluate both named entity (NE) directed graph visualization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling. NE directed graph visualization consistently outperforms topic modelling for discovering connected entities in the long tail of online forums and marketplaces.
Online notepad services allow users to upload and share free text anonymously. Reviewing Pastebin, one of the most popular online notepad services websites, it is possible to find textual content that could be related to illegal activities, such as leaks of personal information or hyperlinks to multimedia files containing child sexual abuse images or videos. An automatic approach to monitor and to detect these activities in such an active and a dynamic environment could be useful for Law Enforcement Agencies to fight against cybercrime. In this work, we present Pastes Content Classification 17K (PasteCC 17K), a dataset of 17640 textual samples crawled from Pastebin, which are classified in 15 categories, being 6 of them suspicious to be related to illegal ones. We used PasteCC 17K to evaluated two well-known text representation techniques, ensembled with three different supervised approaches to classify the pastes of the Pastebin website. We found that the best performance is achieved ensembling TF-IDF encoding with Logistic Regression obtaining an accuracy of 98.63%. The proposed model could assist the authorities in the detection of suspicious content shared in Pastebin.
Given the increasing financial impact of cybercrime, it has become critical for companies to manage information security risk. The practitioner literature has long argued that the internal audit function (IAF) can play an important role both in providing assurance with respect to information security and in generating insights about how to improve the organization's information security. Nevertheless, there is scant empirical evidence to support this belief. Using a unique data set, this study examines how the quality of the relationship between the internal audit and the information security functions affects objective measures of the overall effectiveness of an organization's information security efforts. The quality of this relationship has a positive effect on the number of reported internal control weaknesses and incidents of noncompliance, as well as on the numbers of security incidents detected, both before and after they caused material harm to the organization. In addition, we find that higher levels of management support for information security and having the chief information security officer (CISO) report independently of the IT function have a positive effect on the quality of the relationship between the internal audit and information security functions.

Botnets, although technically based on long lasting well established attacking models, currently represent an increasing threat, moving huge amounts of capitals from legal system to criminals. This is mainly due to its adaptability, based on Crime-as-a-Service model, where different, transnational, actors are located in the different rings of the crime supply chain. Moreover, botnet success has been enabled by two main factors: the weak countermeasures adoption, reinforced by the well-known dominance of software attacker versus defender and the revenue model, which considers the target of the attack out of the victim (ICT users) control. Finally, the losses are typically in charge of silent financial/insurance organizations. These botnet pillars are available for renting at low-cost by criminal organizations, exploiting the dark side of the success factor of the Internet business players, the network externality, where targets, e.g. Internet two sided markets, can be easily predicted but not yet adequately protected. In this paper, the authors will describe, by Zeus and other botnet examples, the revenue model and its related costs as cybercrime, focusing on the concerning evolution of this threat and proposing some strategies to cope with it.
"With the functioning of the global Internet, the geopolitical struggle between the states has intensified significantly in the information sphere. Transformations of the security space in modern conditions are leading to extraordinary events in cyberspace in Europe and other countries, which are becoming more frequent and large-scale. This situation requires intensification of international cooperation in the field of information space protection. A significant part of the risks in the information sphere arises due to the lag of legal regulation from scientific and technological progress. This has led to problems of protection of personal data of citizens and ensuring the sustainable operation of information and telecommunications systems of critical infrastructure. One of the main ways to overcome the lag is timely and proper regulation of these processes. Effective international cooperation to protect the information space will be facilitated by: improving coordination of actions and cooperation within international organizations in order to strengthen cyber resilience; purposeful fight against cybercrime in Ukraine and the world; development of cybersecurity dialogue at the national and international levels; close public-private partnership in the institutional provision of information and cybersecurity management."
The objective of this research was to identify aspects of warnings that will reduce online disclosure of personal information, specifically aspects that people do not consider sensitive. The vast majority of online commercial websites collect personal data, and many consumers report cybercrime events, such that identity theft is a significant risk. Most people can be uniquely identified by the combination of their birth date, age, and gender. This is problematic, since people do not believe these identity elements to be important to safeguard. Participants were asked to provide personal information to receive an online insurance quote. Participants in experimental conditions were warned not to disclose their date of birth. The experimental manipulations were (a) the vividness of the warnings and (b) whether an alternative to disclosure was recommended. Analyses indicated that providing an alternative to disclosure proved to be an effective strategy to reduce disclosure. Personal information disclosure can be reduced through warnings, but warnings need to be carefully designed and tested. Clear recommendations for alternative behavior may be especially effective. Designers of warnings and alerts can use the principles identified in this research to make their messages more effective.
Malicious domain names are useful for cybercrime, but can be easily blocked by blacklists. To avoid a single point of failure, cybercriminals use domain generation algorithm to generate a large number of malicious domains. Once the victim's machine is infected with malware, the malware tends to connect to malicious domain names to commit cybercrimes, such as waiting for remote control commands or sending malware feedback. Therefore, how to detect these malicious connections has been a hot research topic in information security. In this paper, a new method of tracking malicious domain and victim machine by scalability system named CC-Tracker (Cyber Criminal Tracker) based on HTTP is presented. CC-Tracker extracts 12 features from HTTP traffic using MapReduce framework based Interaction Profiling Bipartite Graph mining. Experimental results show that CC-Tracker can reach 99% AUC in the evaluation benchmark. In addition in the deployment environment found new malicious domain of network traffic, and dig out the hidden in the enterprise, the victims of the machine these malicious domain are a threat to other online reputation system can't identify. The scalability and applicability of CC-Tracker are demonstrated by experiments on the real-world environment.
"As individuals increasingly engage with the digital landscape, they face a multitude of risks associated with their online activities and the security of their personal information. Individuals seek guidance in balancing the benefits and risks of the digital transformation. To effectively mitigate these risks, it is essential to establish a comprehensive Digital Risk Assessment Framework tailored to individual users. In this research, an a interpretive study have been carried out to propose a novel Digital Security Management Framework. The main contribution of this study is providing a novel approach by examining the recent recorded threats against individuals, quantifying these threats, and proposing a novel digital risk framework detailing the list of threats and the corresponding risk treatment options tailored for individuals. The scenario of the case study is a family that use personal computers to access banking and investment accounts online, engage in online shopping and also frequently use social media to share artwork and opinions. 17 types of digital risks were identified and the probability of loss and impact of each risk have been quantified using Bernoulli distribution f(L;p). The quantified values were used to prioritise mitigation measures. According to the results, and the proposed framework, suitable treatment option(s) was recommended for each risk. The results show that online scams present the biggest financial risk to individuals, that security incidents present a moderate risk, and that communication-based harms (e.g. bullying and radicalization) are difficult to quantify."
The rapid growth and usefulness of Internet of Things (IoT) has seen it being deployed in critical and strategic infrastructure sectors like healthcare, transport, agriculture, home automation, and smart industries among many others. The benefits of comfort and reliability of IoT technologies to human beings have brought with them security concerns. This is due to its large-scale connectivity and over reliance on the internet for communication making it susceptible to cyberattacks. Digital forensics experts face a daunting task of handling these cyberattacks because of the unique and complex challenges posed by IoT. Recently, researchers have been drawn to finding solutions to these challenges, however, this is still in its infancy. This paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the current research advancements in IoT forensics. We define key IoT fundamentals, IoT applications, the need for IoT forensics, identify the key factors affecting IoT forensics, and review the practicality of the available IoT forensics frameworks, models, and methodologies. The SLR reveals research gaps indicating that most of the current research is more theoretical than practical. There is a need for more practical approaches to tackle the unique IoT forensics challenges. Finally, for future research directions from the SLR, we have highlighted and discussed the open challenges and requirements for IoT forensics. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
As we now see digital evidence play a role in many investigative scenarios, it is imperative that those seeking to rely upon it as part of criminal justice processes can do so, absent any concern regarding its validity. Interpreting the meaning of digital data and its potential value to a criminal inquiry as part of a digital forensic examination is a complex and multifaceted process requiring the practitioner to possess the relevant knowledge, experience, and insight needed to determine the case-significance of a given data trace accurately. Erroneously interpreted data that is communicated to a client and subsequently relied upon can have far-reaching consequences for all those involved in the investigative process. This work discusses the process of forming investigative opinions in digital forensic science examinations, what this means in practice, and the ways in which it can be achieved. Focus will be given to the process of forming an investigative opinion when underpinned through the reconstruction and testing of a suspect system/setup, with a formal three-stage methodology for doing this outlined. This article is categorized under: Digital and Multimedia Science > Cybercrime Investigation
Cyberbullying has been defined as the process of using the internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person. The word cyberbullying is often used interchangeably with cyber stalking and in fact the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act 2015 of Nigeria, uses the word cyber stalking which it defines as any course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. By the provisions of the Act, the transmission of any communication through the means of a computer to bully, threaten or harass another person where such communication places another person in fear of death, violence or bodily harm amounts to cyber stalking. Cyberbullying is becoming a common phenomenon in Nigeria as more people engage in it especially on social media platforms. This is carried out in various ways and a common trend is posting indecent imagery of persons online such as naked pictures or videos of persons in order to humiliate them. When posted by a person, the communication is shared by others thereby causing circulation on social media. This act amounts to cyber stalking where the intention consists of those elements stated under the Cybercrimes Act. In other situations where it is shared without the aim of humiliating the victim, such act can still be incriminated under some other laws in Nigeria such as the Criminal Code Act and the Penal Code Act which for instance both criminalise obscene publications. It is worthy of note there have been reported cases where victims of cyberbullying have committed suicide as a result of fear or shame. A major observation is that cyberbullying has gained normalcy and many internet users engaged in it do not seem to be aware of the criminal connotation of their actions. This paper examines the effectiveness of legal responses to cyberbullying in Nigeria. It discusses the forms of cyberbullying commonly perpetrated in Nigeria by citing some real life instances that have happened in the past. The paper notes that most forms of cyberbullying can be prosecuted under the Cybercrimes Act, however, there has not been any notable enforcement of the law in terms of prosecution of cyberbullying cases. It appears that the lack of prosecution of offenders has fostered the act of cyberbullying especially under the present circumstances where there is widespread ignorance among internet users. The paper also notes that the absence of image rights is a precursor in many respects to some forms of cyberbullying especially when photographs and videos of victims are involved. The paper advocates the implementation and enforcement of the Cybercrimes Act as well as other laws relating to cyberbullying in Nigeria. The paper also posits that the protection of image rights will go a long way to assist in curbing the act of cyberbullying in Nigeria.
Child Pornography is an increasingly visible rising cybercrime in the world today. Over the past decade, with rapid growth in smart phone usage, readily available free Cloud Computing storage, and various mobile communication apps, child pornographers have found a convenient and reliable mobile platform for instantly sharing pictures or videos of children being sexually abused. Within this new paradigm, law enforcement officers are finding that detecting, gathering, and processing evidence for the prosecution of child pornographers is becoming increasingly challenging. Deep learning is a machine learning method that models high-level abstractions in data and extracts hierarchical representations of data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers. This paper presents a conceptual model of deep learning approach for detecting child pornography within the new paradigm by using log analysis, file name analysis and cell site analysis which investigate text logs of events that have happened in the smart phone at the scene of the crime using physical and logical acquisition to assists law enforcement officers in gathering and processing child pornography evidence for prosecution. In addition, this paper shows an illustrative example of logical and physical acquisition on smart phones using forensics tools.
The vulnerabilities in a software can be exploited and can result in damaging important resources. To prevent such exploitations, anti-virus companies introduces new virus signatures in their databases. The approach requires network system to be analyzed constantly to discover harmful traffic. The harmful traffic can consist of single or multiple threats that can use vulnerability in one or another way. To discover vulnerability at earlier stage, is important because it can give time to remove the weaknesses from the system thus closing the way for intruders to exploit it. In this paper, we propose a Honeynet Vulnerabilities Detector system (HVD) to detect unknown vulnerabilities in software. To mitigate the risk of detection of HVD (fingerprint identification), we provide the attackers unlimited outbound connections. The increased number of connections can give rise to security threat for protection networks (non-Honeynet systems) and to prevent such threats, we propose a method to protect such systems The HVD will be able to detect the unknown vulnerabilities in software. The detection of unknown vulnerabilities will result in providing opportunities to software developers to fix/remove them.
Purpose: This paper explores the concept of criminal expertise within the context of online pedophile community and applies rational choice theory to understand the decision-making processes of offenders. Specifically, this study aims to explore the cybersecurity concerns of dark web pedophile forum users known to be a hard-to-reach offender population.Methods: Sequential generalized linear model and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to examine cybersecurity themes predicting both the lifespan and survival of 290 cybersecurity-related threads extracted from three pedophile forums identified on the dark web.Results: Results showed that that risk factors for law enforcement identification-related topics were the most predictive of threads' lifespan and survival. Moreover, topics related to proactive protection strategies were more predictive than those related to reactive ones. Finally, threads with a superior skill level were more likely to survive than other types of content.Conclusion: This study builds upon both criminal expertise and cybercrime literature, particularly on the appli-cability of the criminal expertise framework to dark web pedophile forum users and provide a better under-standing of the enculturation process among pedophile community.
Today mobile phones provide a wide range of applications that make our daily life easy. With popularity, smartphones have become a target for cybercrime where malicious apps are developed to acquire sensitive information or corrupt data. To mitigate this issue and to improve the security in mobile devices, different techniques have been used. These techniques can be broadly classified as static, dynamic and hybrid approaches. In this paper, a static-based model MalDuoNet is proposed to detect Android malwares, which uses a DualNet framework to analyze the features from the API calls. In the MalDuoNet model, one sub-network is focused to learn the features relevant to malicious behavior and the other sub-network is focused to learn the features in general. Thus it enables the model to learn complementary features which in turn helps get richer features for analysis. Then the features from the two sub-networks are combined in the final fused classifier for the final classification. In addition, each of the feature extractors has a separate classifier so that each sub-network can optimize its performance separately. The experimental results demonstrate that the MalDuoNet model outperforms the two baseline models with single network.
New information technologies are beneficial for ship operations in terms of safety and utilisation of company resources. However, new cybercrime threats have emergedaffecting, both ship safety and security that need to be assessed and evaluated. At the moment, actions of the maritime industry to keep pace dealing with such threats are slow when compared with other business sectors. As a high concern, maritime pirates could take advantage of cybersecurity breaches to monitor ship activity and gain information for potential protective failures. In 2021 companies and seafarers should be able to demonstrate knowledge and safeguard policies of their companies. Nevertheless, there is limited discussion on how companies will educate seafarers for existing threats. Therefore, in this study, a risk-based methodology is proposed for evaluation of cybersecurity threats in the context of a piracy attack. STPA-SafeSec's analysis is used to identify security threats, and FAHP is utilised for evaluating the severity of each security constraint. Audits on 15 ships with 315 seafarers indicated that there are significant security gaps mainly due to lack of awareness from operators and seafarers. However, physical security and network protection that already apply to ships are significant security strengths.
In recent years, many human activities have made cyberspace their preferred environment. This study focuses on the betting environment, specifically on fixed-match informing websites (FMIWs). These sites claim to be capable of selling tips about fixed sports events. They essentially act as vendors of confidential sources, allowing punters to place 100% sure bets. We hypothesize that cyber places for match-fixing tips facilitate deviant behaviors. Through systematic observation, we describe and quantify a set of 15 environmental features they share, which do not always belong to regulated online betting platforms. Findings from 78 FMIWs corroborate our hypothesis, as they support the relevance of Environmental Criminology theories applied to cybercrime. Additional exploration through hyperlink network analysis shows that FMIWs are highly homogeneous and have similar characteristics to the Tor network but differ from other illicit online environments such as sexual child exploitation networks or white supremacist communities. The characteristics of the network suggest that the business is more similar to a fraud scheme than an illicit market. Finally, the practical implications of the results for crime prevention and the directions for future research are outlined.
Performing cyber maneuvers in an operational environment is not easy. We need a cyber-situational awareness framework to perform its maneuvers to protect the cyberspace and to cope with its attacks. The battlefield provided has essential information for detecting cybercrime events. The present study resolved the challenges of implementing these maneuvers through dynamic simulation of the cyber battlefield. The cyber battlefield contains detailed information on cyberspace elements, including the vulnerability knowledge repository, the tangible and intangible components of the cyberspace allowing maneuvering, penetration testing, injection attacks, tracking attacks, visualization, evaluation of the impact of cyberattacks, and risk evaluation. By injecting attacks and using the proposed algorithms, an impact assessment of each attack step on each of the elements of the environment has been done to identify potential threats. Using the proposed algorithms, an impact assessment has been performed on each of the environmental elements in order to identify potential threats. A dynamic updating simulator engine has been designed to update the vulnerability knowledge base automatically and change the topology and features of elements, accesses, services, hosts, and users. Modeling and simulation were evaluated using a qualitative research method and creating a focus group.
The volume and frequency of new cyber attacks have exploded in recent years. Such events have very complicated workflows and involve multiple criminal actors and organizations. However, current practices for threat analysis and intelligence discovery are still performed piecemeal in an ad-hoc manner. For example, a modern malware analysis system can dissect a piece of malicious code by itself. But, it cannot automatically identify the criminals who developed it or relate other cyber attack events with it. Consequently, it is imperative to automatically assemble the jigsaw puzzles of cybercrime events by performing threat intelligence fusion on data collected from heterogeneous sources, such as malware, underground social networks, cryptocurrency transaction records, etc. In this paper, we propose an Automated Threat Intelligence fuSion framework (ATIS) that is able to take all sorts of threat sources into account and discover new intelligence by connecting the dots of apparently isolated cyber events. To this end, ATIS consists of 5 planes, namely analysis, collection, controller, data and application planes. We discuss the design choices we made in the function of each plane and the interfaces between two adjacent planes. In addition, we develop two applications on top of ATIS to demonstrate its effectiveness.
This study examines how the COVID-19 emergency has impacted crime across different locations in Nigeria. Data were collected from a sample of residents from across Nigeria and analysed using mean ratings, percentages and chi-square. Based on the residents' perceptions, certain crime types have decreased (e.g. home break-ins and assaults), some remain unchanged (e.g. stealing and pilfering) and others have increased (e.g. cybercrime and domestic violence). The findings show concentrations of crime in urban centres, states on total lockdown and geographical areas with poor economic indicators. The times that most crimes are perpetrated remain unchanged, except for the night time, where there has been a significant increase. Generally, individual responses to crime remain unchanged, although the use of security guards and special security door locks has changed significantly. Conversely, neighbourhood-level responses have changed significantly, particularly with the use of vigilante groups, police and military patrols as well as restrictions of human and vehicular movement. Although some of the causes of this crime change existed before COVID-19, new crime opportunities are also acknowledged. The findings suggest that Nigerian cities may face a severe battle to recover from crime even after the COVID-19 emergency has passed. Policy and further research implications are discussed.
This paper investigates the economic perspective analysis of protecting security and privacy of big data. Traditionally, the pressing cyberthreats appear from emailed attachments. Recently, cyberattacks increasingly stealing or compromising data and are the potentials for physical damage to critical infrastructure. The risks of the data breach or compromised data collection are often favored by potential financial benefits (e.g., blackmail, fraud, false information, intellectual property thefts, business competition). That is, an important factor for current and future economical investments is due to the motivation of cybercrime activities. In this paper, we first analyze a question about our effort on security and privacy in terms of economic perspectives. That is, do we need to protect big data in a secure, private, and most effective manner, while the growing amount of security threats, attacks, and data breaches together with the increasing market for security products arises? Secondly, we perform the investigation from several perspectives: the economic perspective of big data security and privacy, investment decisions, fighting cybercrimes through big data, and cyberinsurance for big data. Our objective is to provide economic justification of technical decisions taken to protect the big data and the amount of costs that organizations often spend for it. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One of the problems often associated with online anonymity is that it hinders social accountability, as substantiated by the high levels of cybercrime. Although identity cues are scarce in cyberspace, individuals often leave behind textual identity traces. In this study we proposed the use of stylometric analysis techniques to help identify individuals based on writing style. We incorporated a rich set of stylistic features, including lexical, syntactic, structural, content-specific, and idiosyncratic attributes. We also developed the Writeprints technique for identification and similarity detection of anonymous identities. Writeprints is a Karhunen-Loeve transforms-based technique that uses a sliding window and pattern disruption algorithm with individual author-level feature sets. The Writeprints,technique and extended feature set were evaluated on a testbed encompassing four online datasets spanning different domains: email, instant messaging, feedback comments, and program code. Writeprints outperformed benchmark techniques, including SVM, Ensemble SVM, PCA, and standard Karhunen-Loeve transforms, on the identification and similarity detection tasks with accuracy as high as 94% when differentiating between 100 authors. The extended feature set also significantly outperformed a baseline set of features commonly used in previous research. Furthermore, individual-author-level feature sets generally outperformed use of a single group of attributes.
Due to the widespread use of multimedia data over the internet, it has become important to protect the data from unauthorized access and make the information secure. Digital watermarking is the solution to prevent unauthorized access and to protect the copyright. In this paper, a naive watermarking scheme has been proposed. The authors for the first time have introduced Ranklets which is a new domain for watermarking along with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). To achieve better robustness and imperceptibility, the proposed scheme makes use of the Ranklets to select the mid -rank coefficients for watermark embedding. The wilxon statistics have been used for dispersion in Rank transform. Extensive experiments have been carried out to prove the claim of better robustness and imperceptibility.
"Revenge pornography is the online distribution of sexually uncensored images or videos of another person without consent and to cause embarrassment or torment. Victims of revenge pornography suffer significant harm, including losing jobs and, in extreme cases, committing suicide. The public blames the victim for the role they played. Rather than victim-blaming, victims deserve a takedown order and criminal liability for uploaders of such images. This study adopts a doctrinal approach; it examines key statutes and their interpretation by Nigerian courts while juxtaposing it with the law and practice in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom was undertaken as a case study because it has a developed jurisprudence which can provide lessons for Nigeria. This study found that the current state of laws in Nigeria is ill-equipped to tackle the menace of revenge pornography. The objective of this study is to offer insights on the prevalence of revenge pornography in Nigeria and suggest legal solutions to address this phenomenon. It canvasses for a non-consensual pornography provision that would criminalise the act of revenge pornography in Nigeria. It also makes a case for cyber-censorship of contents by internet service providers and the need for third-party liability."
The methods and tools used by the European Union to counter hybrid threats are identified: from the fight against terrorism to measures aimed at combating economic competitors and political opponents (mainly, to squeeze Russia and China out of European markets). It is concluded that it is not by chance that neither EU institutions nor the research community have worked out a comprehensive definition of operations to combat hybrid threats. A broad understanding of hybrid threats as practically any (depending on the political situation) actions of the opponent serves to justify the application of any counteraction tool. In the fight against global threats such as terrorism, cybercrime, and the spread of false medical data, the EU takes a systemic approach, which makes it possible to assess the level and degree of the convergence of threats to critical infrastructure and the infosphere, as well as the possibilities of counteraction. At the same time, attempts to use economic, legislative, political, and informational tools to achieve one-sided economic, political, and military advantages do not reduce the degree of tension in the EU's relations with Russia, China, and some other countries, only increasing the number and strength of hybrid threats. This reduces the EU's ability to achieve strategic autonomy.
Since the 1980s, the digital revolution has been both a negative and positive force. Within a few weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak, lockdown accelerated the adoption of digital solutions at an unprecedented pace, creating unforeseen opportunities for scaling up alternative approaches to social and economic life. But it also brought digital risks and threats that placed new demands on policymakers. This article assembles evidence from different areas of social science expertise about the impacts of Covid-19 in digitised societies and policy responses. The authors show how the pandemic supported changes in data collection techniques and dissemination practices for official statistics, and how seemingly insuperable obstacles to the implementation of e-health treatments were largely overcome. They demonstrate how the ethics of artificial intelligence became a primary concern for government legislation at national and international levels, and how the features enabling smart cities to act as drivers of productivity did not necessarily give them an advantage during the pandemic. At the micro-level, families are shown to have become 'digital by default', as children were exposed to online risks and opportunities. Globally, the spread of the pandemic provided a fertile ground for cybercrime, while digital disinformation and influencing risked becoming normalised and domesticated.
There has been a lot of research in developing technologies and strategies to make Smart Grid a practical reality. Research has focussed on a wide range of domains like communication technologies and protocols, infrastructure reliability and availability, designing of intelligent applications and distribution automation. However, to make Smart Grid to be widely accepted and adopted by the community, security at all levels of the smart grid will have to be ensured. Although, existing security approaches could be applied to control cybercrime on the smart grid, the limited latency tolerance of communications within certain levels of the smart grid make it challenging. With an aim to address this problem, the paper makes three important contributions. First, it introduces a classification of devices used in the smart grid based on their computational capabilities. Second, it highlights the challenges faced in addressing the high performance computational requirements of cybersecurity in the smart grid. Third, it proposes a few practical solutions from research in advanced processor and accelerators architectures and parallel computing paradigms commonly used in the field of High Performance Computing in addressing them. Overall, a strong case is presented to revisit the standards that specify the minimum processor requirements of devices connected to the smart grid at all levels to increase cybersecurity on the smart grid.
In this paper we exploit market features proper of a leading Russian cybercrime market for user impersonation at scale to evaluate attacker preferences when purchasing stolen user profiles, and the overall economic activity of the market. We run our data collection over a period of 161 days and collect data on a sample of 1'193 sold user profiles out of 11'357 advertised products in that period and their characteristics. We estimate a market trade volume of up to approximately 700 profiles per day, corresponding to estimated daily sales of up to 4'000 USD and an overall market revenue within the observation period between 540k and 715k USD. We find profile provision to be rather stable over time and mainly focused on European profiles, whereas actual profile acquisition varies significantly depending on other profile characteristics. Attackers' interests focus disproportionally on profiles of certain types, including those originating in North America and featuring Crypto resources. We model and evaluate the relative importance of different profile characteristics in the final decision of an attacker to purchase a profile, and discuss implications for defenses and risk evaluation.
With the increased proliferation of internet-enabled mobile devices and large internet use, cybercrime incidents have grown exponentially, often leading to huge financial losses. Most cybercrimes are launched through malware attacks, phishing attacks, denial/distributed denial of attacks, looting people's money, stealing credential information for unauthorized use, personal identity thefts, etc. Timely detection of malware can avoid such damage. However, it requires an efficient and effective approach to detecting such attacks. This study attempts to devise a malware detection approach using transfer learning and machine learning algorithms. A hybrid approach has been adopted where pre-trained models VVG-16 and ResNet-50 extract hybrid feature sets from the data to be used with the machine learning algorithms. In doing so, this study contrives the Bi-model architecture where the same models are combined sequentially in the stacked form to obtain higher performance as the output of the first model is used to train the second model. With the Bi-model structure, 100% accuracy is obtained for a 25 classes problem. Performance comparison with state-of-the-art models and T-test proves the superior performance of the proposed approach. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Social media is an important platform for accessing information and connecting with friends and family, yet in 2016, only 34% of Americans over the age of 64 had ever used online networking sites. Older people face significant barriers to usage of social media and are particularly vulnerable to internet-based scams, yet risk suffering from loneliness and isolation while they go through major life changes associated with aging. Research suggests that social media could be an important tool to reduce this isolation, and help people stay connected and supported while they age. This essay discusses the heightened relevance of this topic in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, how older people most often interact with social media, the digital divide and how it disproportionately affects seniors, and some important upsides and downsides of older people being active on social media. Upsides include the capacity of social media to reduce isolation among vulnerable populations and improve various health outcomes, as well as being a chance to stay current with family members' lives. The most pressing downside is the dangers faced by older users who may not know how to protect themselves against internet-based fraud and identity theft. For those who wish to encourage older people to use social media to connect, there is therefore a strong need for digital literacy programs to help them learn to do so safely. Librarians can and will play a huge role in the future of this issue.
Phishing attacks against financial institutions constitutes a major concern and forces them to invest thousands of dollars annually in prevention, detection and takedown of these kinds of attacks. This operation is so massive and time critical that there is usually no time to perform analysis to look for patterns and correlations between attacks. In this work we summarize our findings after applying data analysis and clustering analysis to the record of attacks registered for a major financial institution in the US. We use HTML structure and content analysis, as well as domain registration records and DNS RRSets information of the sites, in order to look for patterns and correlations between phishing attacks. It is shown that by understanding and clustering the different types of phishing sites, we are able to identify different strategies used by criminal organizations. Furthermore, the findings of this study provide us valuable insight into who is targeting the institution and their modus operandi, which gives us a solid foundation for the construction of more and better tools for detection and takedown, and eventually for forensic analysts who will be able to correlate cases and perform focused searches that speed up their investigations.
Tor traffic tracking is valuable for combating cybercrime as it provides insights into the traffic active on the Tor network. Tor-based application traffic classification is one of the tracking methods, which can effectively classify Tor application services. However, it is not effective in classifying specific applications due to more complicated traffic patterns in the spatial and temporal dimensions. As a solution, the authors propose FlowMFD, a novel Tor-based application traffic classification approach using amount-frequency-direction (MFD) chromatographic features and spatial-temporal modelling. Expressly, FlowMFD mines the interaction pattern between Tor applications and servers by analysing the time series features (TSFs) of different size packets. Then MFD chromatographic features (MFDCF) are designed to represent the pattern. Those features integrate multiple low-dimensional TSFs into a single plane and retain most pattern information. In addition, FlowMFD utilises a cascaded model with a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit to capture spatial-temporal dependencies between MFDCF. The authors evaluate FlowMFD under the public ISCXTor2016 dataset and the self-collected dataset, where we achieve an accuracy of 92.1% (4.2%up arrow) and 88.3% (4.5%up arrow), respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art comparison methods.
"The rate and diversity of cybercrime is growing rapidly. It has become more commonplace, more sophisticated, and more damaging, costing the world's economy billions of euro in losses every year. To counteract this rising menace, organisations are continuously increasing their investment in information security and cybersecurity, including ethical hacking or penetration testing services. Traditionally, ethical hackers have always used expensive computationally powerful hardware to run special security-oriented Linux distributions. However, the advent of single board computers in the last decade, has offered new possibilities for ethical hacking. This research aims to explore, in a practical manner, the actual feasibility of performing ethical hacking duties in a non-traditional way, i.e., following a novel approach that still uses the same Linux security distributions, but installing them on these low-cost, highly portable small boards instead. The outcome is a comprehensive study that contributes to the body of work in the literature. We conducted extensive performance tests on 4 devices (3 boards and 1 laptop); results are varied and show that the small boards are capable of performing many jobs, albeit with a larger execution time than a laptop, but in general they are limited in terms of running heavy GUIs."
Online Grooming is a growing phenomenon within online environments. One of the major problems encountered in qualitative internet research of chat communication is the issue of anonymity which is being exploited and greatly enjoyed by chatters. An important question that has been asked in the literature is 'How can a researcher be sure to analyse the communication of children and adolescents and not the chat communication of adults who pretend to be under 18?'. Our reply to this question would be the field of Authorship Analysis. Authorship Analysis offers a way to unmask the anonymity of cyber predators. Stylometry, as used in this chat log analysis, is a type of Authorship Analysis that is not based on an author's handwriting but includes contextual clues from the content of their writings. This research paper will analyse the application of different authorship attribution techniques to chat log from a forensic perspective.
Cybersecurity is a major issue today. It is predicted that cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021. It is important to make logins secure as well as to make advances in security in order to catch cybercriminals. This paper will design and create a device that will use Fuzzy logic to identify a person by the rhythm and frequency of their typing. The device will take data from a user from a normal password entry session. This data will be used to make a Fuzzy system that will be able to identify the user by their typing speed. An application of this project could be used to make a more secure log-in system for a user. The log-in system would not only check that the correct password was entered but also that the rhythm of how the password was typed matched the user. Another application of this system could be used to help catch cybercriminals. A cybercriminal may have a certain rhythm at which they type at and this could be used like a fingerprint to help officials locate cybercriminals.
The botnet, a group of computers infected with malicious software and remotely controlled without their owners' knowledge, is a ubiquitous tool of cybercrime. Law enforcement can take over botnets, typically by seizing their central command and control servers. They can then manipulate the malware installed on private computers to shut the botnet down. This Note examines the Fourth Amendment implications of the government's use of remote control of malware on private computers to neutralize botnets. It finds that the government could take more intrusive action on infected computers than it has previously done without performing a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Most significantly, remotely finding and removing malware on infected computers does not necessarily trigger Fourth Amendment protections. Computer owners have no possessory interest in malware, so modifying or removing it does not constitute a seizure. Additionally, even if the government's efforts cause some harm to private computers, this will rarely produce a seizure under the Fourth Amendment because any interference with the computer will be unintentional. Remotely executing commands on infected computers does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment unless information is returned to law enforcement.
Malware, a lethal weapon of cyber attackers, is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with rapid deployment and self-propagation. In addition, modern malware is one of the most devastating forms of cybercrime, as it can avoid detection, make digital forensics investigation in near real-time impossible, and the impact of advanced evasion strategies can be severe and far-reaching. This makes it necessary to detect it in a timely and autonomous manner for effective analysis. This work proposes a new systematic approach to identifying modern malware using dynamic deep learning-based methods combined with heuristic approaches to classify and detect five modern malware families: adware, Radware, rootkit, SMS malware, and ransomware. Our symmetry investigation in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity analytics will enhance malware detection, analysis, and mitigation abilities to provide resilient cyber systems against cyber threats. We validated our approach using a dataset that specifically contains recent malicious software to demonstrate that the model achieves its goals and responds to real-world requirements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the combination of behavior-based deep learning and heuristic-based approaches for malware detection and classification outperforms the use of static deep learning methods.
One Time Password (OTP) and Text Password are becoming less important in the current age of cybercrime because of the rapid development of new security systems. A user authentication system that is easy, robust, scalable, and cost-effective is a must. For both security and surveillance purposes, keystroke biometrics is a viable option. Behavior biometrics, of which keystroke biometrics is a subset, is used to identify individuals based on the way they type. Typing habits are not set in stone and are subject to change depending on the scenario, the device being used, and the user's emotional state. As a result, the performance of a keystroke biometrics-based user authentication system is influenced by how well the retrieved information from typing and classification algorithms is processed. Using a keyboard with an array of pressure sensors, this research presents a unique way to keystroke dynamics-based authentication. The goal of this study is to develop user profiles that are unique and different in order to improve the suggested system's efficiency. A real-world dataset is used to test the suggested method. The outcome is achieved with a 97% success rate in experiments.
This paper studies the behaviour analysis of distinct operating systems for the purpose of forensics investigation in the IPv6 network and ensures the detection as well as identification of the network host. The network forensics parameters help to capture, filter, analyse, and information reporting about the computer-based incidents and activities of cybercrime. IPv6 supports tackling the complication of traffic in a network environment, such as dual-stack, tunnel, and translation. This research sheds light on the IPv6 network, assesses the automatic and manual transition in order to characterise network behaviour. This paper proposes a flexible and automated method architecture to analyse operating systems behaviour by observing the system function calls, performing network investigation by using PCAP file analysis to help detect and identify the host, sessions, and open ports in the virtual environment. Through the experimental result on the network traffic, PCAP files dataset of the University of New Haven, the proposed model can archive identify network host in IPv6 network with high accuracy rate, the result shows the robustness of the NetworkMiner in terms of behaviour analysis with efficacy as compared to other state-of-the-art schemes.
Cloud computing is a revolutionary technology that provide computing and storage resources as a service accessible via network connections. Cloud computing has two foremost models which are services and deployment. One of the significant deployment models is a private cloud which is used by large organizations for building a corporate cloud inside their internal departments to provide computing services such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). They adopted the internal private cloud to reduce cost and save time. In last decades, number of severe attacks and threats against the private cloud is increasing which make it facing complex challenges in the security province so that a forensic approach for cybercrime investigation should be systematized. Therefore, this paper presents a digital forensic approach for investigation of cybercrimes in a private cloud environment. Here, focus on using virtualization technology solutions from VMware for building experimental environment. From the experiment analysis, the proposed approach can help digital investigators and practitioners in acquisition and collection of digital evidence from the private cloud infrastructures especially virtual machine which is considered the core element of virtualized cloud systems.
The pace of development of the digital economy is growing rapidly from year to year. Internet, related digital technologies, as well as automation processes are widespread and change the entire system of economic activity. In the new conditions, it is necessary to assess the effects of digitalization, their impact on human life and business activities. In the event of risks and threats to economic security, the state should act as a regulator and include compensatory protection mechanisms. The article reveals the nature of the interaction of the digital economy, institutional changes and economic security. It is proved that the root causes of risks and threats to economic security, such as an increase in costs for each group of subjects due to excessive load and the institutional manifestation of regulatory arbitrage, the change in the labor market and the release of labor resources, intensive development of cybercrime are inadequate institutional structure of society, the imbalance of formal and informal institutions, their low efficiency. The analysis of positive (technological, economic and social) effects of digitalization is made, and also the risks and threats which are manifestation of negative effects of digital development are systematized.
Today, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) can be considered as the new big target for cyber attacks, while the cybercrime prevention is often neglected within their environment. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of cybersecurity threats in the Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) ecosystem of a Smart-Home/Office environment being constituted by SMEs that contains various smart -devices and IoT equipment, smart-grid components, employees'workstations and medium sized networking equipment. As the Cyber-security in such an ecosystem is greatly demanding and challenging because of the various communication layers and the different supported IoT devices, we introduce a more robust, resilient and effective cybersecurity solution that can be effortlessly tailored to each individual enterprise's evolving needs and can also speedily adapt/respond to the changing cyber threat landscape. Thus, this Cyber-security framework will be evaluated through three major types of Smart-Home/Office datasets and will be supported from SME/ICT clusters under the framework of the Secure and Private Smart Grid (SPEAR) H2020 project. The first promising results of our work indicate the potential of implementing strong defence mechanisms for SMEs' environments within DIHs.
PurposeThe purpose of the study is to show that divergent perceptions among regulators, the regulated and the associated regulatory bodies across multiple jurisdictions regarding the nature and functionality of cryptocurrencies hamper the development of a more comprehensive and coherent regulatory framework in curbing crimes and other related risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Design/methodology/approachThe study has used a descriptive doctrinal legal research method to investigate and understand the insights of existing laws and regulations in four selected jurisdictions concerning cryptocurrencies and how these laws could be further improved and developed to reduce crypto-related crimes. Furthermore, the study has also used a comparative research method to conceptualize the contours of the new legal discourse emerging from cryptocurrencies to adopt and implement a sound regulatory framework. FindingsThe study illustrated that divergent regulatory treatment among different jurisdictions might suffocate novel digital innovations such as cryptocurrency. These fragmented regulatory approaches by various jurisdictions question the sustainability of the present national legislation adopted to regulate cryptocurrencies. Looking into other jurisdictional developments in regulating cryptocurrencies, it is apparent that a concerted regulatory approach is needed to minimize the abuse of this innovation. Research limitations/implicationsThe study has implications for regulators and policymakers to review the current regulatory framework for regulating cryptocurrencies to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The divergent legislative measures concerning cryptocurrency among different jurisdictions question the sustainability of these legislative initiatives, considering the evolving and borderless nature of cryptocurrency. Therefore, this paper will help regulators to consider the present legislative gaps in establishing a common global regulatory approach in the crypto sphere. Originality/valueThe study contributes to the existing body of literature by examining the regulatory frameworks of four jurisdictions, namely, the USA, Canada, China and the EU, related to cryptocurrencies, with a discussion on the development of cryptocurrencies-related laws among these four jurisdictions and their sustainability in curbing crimes in the Darknet.
Network flow monitoring has been a part of network security for the last dozen years. It is constantly evolving to keep pace with changes in network operation and innovative network attacks. The thesis contributes to the continuous efforts by exploring the possibilities unlocked by extending the flow data with application-specific information. We show how the construction of flows is affected by processing of application data, present the benefits to traffic analysis, and assess the inevitable performance loss caused by additional data processing. To compensate for the lost performance, several novel optimisation techniques are proposed for the flow monitoring process. Recognising that the increasing deployment of encryption is going to limit the benefits of application flow monitoring, we perform a survey of methods for measurement of encrypted traffic. The thesis is concluded by an outlook towards future possibilities for flow monitoring advancement.
Cybercrime is growing at a rapid pace, and its techniques are becoming more sophisticated. In order to actively cope with such threats, new approaches based on machine learning and requiring less administrator intervention have been proposed, but there are still many technical difficulties in detecting security attacks in real time. To solve this problem, we propose a new machine learning-based real-time intrusion detection algorithm. Unlike the existing approaches, the one proposed can detect the presence of an attack every time a packet is received, enabling real-time detection. In addition, our algorithm effectively reduces the system load, which may significantly increase from real-time detection, compared to non-real-time detection. In the algorithm, the increase in the number of memory accesses can be minimized (to below 30 %) compared to conventional methods. Since the proposed method is pure software-based approach, it has excellent scalability and flexibility against various attacks. Therefore, the proposed method cannot support the high classification performance of the hardware-based method but also the high flexibility of the software-based method simultaneously, it can effectively detect and prevent various cyber-attacks.
With the progressive increase of network application and electronic devices (computer, mobile phones, android, etc),attack and intrusion detection is becoming a very challenging task in cybercrime detection area. in this context, most of existing approaches of attack detection rely mainly on a finite set of attacks. However, these solutions are vulnerable, that is, they fail in detecting some attacks when sources of informations are ambiguous or imperfect. But, few approaches started investigating toward this direction. Following this trends, this paper investigates the role of machine learning approach (ANN, SVM)in detecting TCP connection traffic as normal or suspicious one. But, using ANN and SVM is an expensive technique individually. In this paper,combining two classifiers has been proposed, where artificial neural network (ANN) classifier and support vector machine (SVM) were employed. Additionally, our proposed solution allows to visualize obtained classification results. Accuracy of the proposed solution has been compared with other classifier results. Experiments have been conducted with different network connection selected from NSL-KDD DARPA dataset. Empirical results show that combining ANN and SVM techniques for attack detection is a promising direction.
The non-consensual dissemination of sexually explicit images or videos for no legitimate purpose represents a serious sexual violation by means of breaching an individual's ability to control their own sexual identity. This article argues that the only adequate legal response to this behaviour is targeted criminal regulation, and that action on a regional level is within the European Union's competence by virtue of Article 83(1) TFEU. The approaches of EU Member States to the phenomenon through targeted criminal law are examined in order to extract positive and negative elements of the respective regulatory systems. Drawing on the experiences of these States, as well as on existing EU criminal directives, a draft directive is included to illustrate what form a European regional system of criminal regulation may take.

Botnets play an important role in malware distribution and they are widely used for spreading malicious activities in the Internet. The study of the literature shows that a large subset of botnets use DNS poisoning to spread out malicious activities and that there are various methods for their detection using DNS queries. However, since botnets generate domain names quite frequently, the resolution of domain names can be very time consuming. Hence, the detection of botnets can be extremely difficult. This chapter propose a novel deep learning framework to detect malicious domains generated by malicious Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA). The proposed DGA detection method, named, Deep Bot Detect (DBD) is able to evaluate data from large scale networks without reverse engineering or performing Non-Existent Domain (NXDomain) inspection. The framework analyzes domain names and categorizes them using statistical features, which are extracted implicitly through deep learning architectures. The framework is tested and deployed in our lab environment. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and shows that the proposed method has high accuracy and low false-positive rates. The proposed framework is a simple architecture that contains fewer learnable parameters compared to other character-based, short text classification models. Therefore, the proposed framework is faster to train and is less prone to over-fitting. The framework provides an early detection mechanism for the identification of Domain-Flux botnets propagating in a network and it helps keep the Internet clean from related malicious activities.
The deployment of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in place of traditional communication facilities has helped in huge reduction in operating costs, as well as enabled adoption of next generation communication services-based IP. At the same time, cyber criminals have also started intercepting environment and creating challenges for law enforcement system in any Country. At this instant, we propose a framework for the forensic analysis of the VoIP traffic over the network. This includes identifying and analyzing of network patterns of VoIP-SIP which is used for the setting up a session for the communication, and VoIP-RTP which is used for sending the data. Our network forensic investigation framework also focus on developing an efficient packet reordering and reconstruction algorithm for tracing the malicious users involved in conversation. The proposed framework is based on network forensics which can be used for content level observation of VoIP and regenerate original malicious content or session between malicious users for their prosecution in the court.
Controlling the flow of sensitive data has been widely acknowledged as a critical aspect for securing web information systems. A common limitation of previous approaches for the implementation of the information flow control is their proposal of new scripting languages. This makes them infeasible to be applied to existing systems written in traditional programming languages as these systems need to be redeveloped in the proposed scripting language. This paper proposes a methodology that offers a common interlinqua through the use of Semantic Web technologies for securing web information systems independently of their programming language.
Information can be considered as an invaluable commodity for all business entities, and has brought about the development of various security architectures devoted to its protection. Corporations have tended to react to the exploitation of information security (InfoSec) vulnerabilities through the implementation of technological measures. Indeed, most security policies and procedures are highly technologically inclined, making use of hardware and software to protect and safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Unfortunately, these tactics have achieved limited success because of inattention to the opportunistic aspects of crime commission. Situational crime prevention can address the importance of these aspects by concentrating on the circumstances associated with a crime, and how the setting, conditions and context can be modified to preclude its manifestation. Its specific application to cyber and InfoSec in a corporate setting is advantageous in developing competent proactive strategies to reduce the presence and attractiveness of criminal possibilities for would-be offenders.
This article introduces the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a criminological audience. After a general review of the phenomenon (including brief explanations of important cognate fields such as 'machine learning', 'deep learning', and 'reinforcement learning'), the paper then turns to the potential application of AI by criminals, including what we term here 'crimeswithAI', 'crimesagainstAI', and 'crimesbyAI'. In these sections, our aim is to highlight AI's potential as a criminogenic phenomenon, both in terms of scaling up existing crimes and facilitating new digital transgressions. In the third part of the article, we turn our attention to the main ways the AI paradigm is transforming policing, surveillance, and criminal justice practices via diffuse monitoring modalities based on prediction and prevention. Throughout the paper, we deploy an array of programmatic examples which, collectively, we hope will serve as a useful AI primer for criminologists interested in the 'tech-crime nexus'.
"This paper presents a study of the Nigeria's presence in Cyberspace. The Cyberspace (Internet) is now critical to every nation's socio-economic, cultural and political activities. When it is disrupted or fails, can grind a nation to a standstill. On the contrary, its correct functioning and pliability is transforming modern society with exceptional pecuniary and social benefits. With nearly all traditional activities increasingly moving to the Internet, Cyberspace has become a new stage for innovations, enterprises, social networking, criminality and war. For this study, the United Nations (UN) e-governance framework was used, the highlights of the United Nations E-Government Survey report of 2014 was analyzed to show the ranking of the world leaders, West African countries and where Nigeria stands. The Internet penetration growth and evolving Internet infrastructure provisioning in Nigeria were reviewed and a critical assessment of Nigeria's presence on the Cyberspace was carried out using the UN online presence index methodology between the months of August and September 2015. The web content, interactivity, the currency of information, downloadable documents, etc. were used to compare various sectors of the Nigerian economy; all tiers of government, academia, and the organized private sector. The study revealed that the organized private sector and private educational institutions are doing better than government educational institutions and ministries. Based on international best practices, a list of recommended actions for increasing cyberspace presence and achieving e-governance for improved services and productivity in Nigeria and similar developing countries is proffered."
Visualizing digital evidence in an easy and constructive manner is a major problem because of the advanced techniques for hiding, wiping, encrypting and deleting digital data developed during the last few years. Oo tackle this problem, a system for visualizing digital data in 3dimensional (3D) mode has been developed. XML was used as a common language to allow fine-grained management of digital data with flexibility and ease. The extensibility of the implementation makes it particularly suitable as a research and development platform in the sector of open source computer forensics tools for the future. This article examines real-life problems that benefit from using this tool in a congenial and constructive manner to validate its key underlining concept. The design decisions that have been taken in producing the system architecture, and the features it supports are elaborated upon. To determine the effectiveness of the tool, an actual case study is presented which examines the results of the tool and why it is necessary to go for an open source model as a standard. The paper concludes with performance measurements of the tool and suggests possible extensions to make the tool even smarter. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V, All rights reserved.
"Phishing is the most prevalent method of cybercrime that convinces people to provide sensitive information; for instance, account IDs, passwords, and bank details. Emails, instant messages, and phone calls are widely used to launch such cyber-attacks. Despite constant updating of the methods of avoiding such cyber-attacks, the ultimate outcome is currently inadequate. On the other hand, phishing emails have increased exponentially in recent years, which suggests a need for more effective and advanced methods to counter them. Numerous methods have been established to filter phishing emails, but the problem still needs a complete solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect phishing emails. This study provides an analysis of the numerous state-of-the-art NLP strategies currently in use to identify phishing emails at various stages of the attack, with an emphasis on ML strategies. These approaches are subjected to a comparative assessment and analysis. This gives a sense of the problem, its immediate solution space, and the expected future research directions.

Identity theft is the most recurrent twenty-first century cybercrime. Thus, authentication is of utmost significance as the number of hackers who seek to intrigue into legitimate user's account to obtain sensitive information is increasing. Identity based authentication operates to corroborate the identity of the user so that only the legitimate user gets access to the service. This paper proposes a quantum identity based authentication and key agreement scheme for cloud server architecture. Quantum cryptography based on the laws of quantum physics is a vital technology for securing privacy and confidentiality in the field of network security. A formal security analysis has been performed using AVISPA tool that confirms the security of the proposed scheme. The security analysis of the proposed protocol proves that it is robust against all security attacks. To confirm applicability of quantum key distribution in cloud computing, a practical long-distance entanglement-based QKD experiment has been proposed. This experiment confirms successful generation of shifted keys over distance of 100 km of optical fiber with a key rate of 4.11 bit/s and an error rate of 9.21 %.
"Most communications in the new era are dependent on Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In addition, infrastructure is becoming increasingly interconnected. This not only makes lives easier, but also leaves technology users more vulnerable. Cybercrime, digital espionage and other cyber disturbances dictate the news reports on a daily basis. In general, cyber-attacks are no longer confined to small-scale rogue hackers. Cyber-attacks are now a part of organised crime and the underground economy, posing a real threat to critical infrastructure; possibly with state actors driving these actions. The responsibility to protect ICT stretches beyond individual companies, sectors and even beyond nations. The authors of this paper propose a Cybersecurity Centre Of Innovation (CCOI) as a central point for the South African government, business and academia to create a secure cyber space for the country: a cyber space without crime that is resilient and resistant to disruptions; a cyber space that promotes innovation, helps the economy and enhances national security. The key driver of the proposed CCOI is collaboration; solutions to cyber risks require a combined approach. This paper describes the organisational structure, functions, activities and benefits of a CCOI."
Fraud detection procedures for national and international economies have become quite an important task. Ensuring the security of transactions carried out by banks and other financial institutions is one of the major factors affecting the reputation and profitability of such organizations. However, since people who perform fraudulent transactions change their methods constantly in order not to get caught up, it gets more difficult to identify and detect this type of transactions. Detecting this type of transactions makes the support of technology compulsory, considering high volume and intensity of transactions. In this paper, we explore practicality of using location data to aid finding better business rules where they can easily be deployed with a rule-based fraud detection and prevention system for retail banking. In order to study the importance of location data, we first compiled a set of anonymized automated teller machine (ATM) usage data from a mid-size bank in Turkey. Depending on how much mobile the card owners are, we can easily devise business rules to detect the anomalies. Such anomalies can be directed to appropriate business units to be analyzed further or account owners may be required additional authorizations for banking activities (such as internet money transfers and payments). We have shown in this paper that a significant bulk of ATM users does not leave the vicinity of their living place. We also give some brief use cases and hints regarding what types of business rules can be extracted from location data.
The shared concern expressed in the two quotes below is that modern technologies provide criminals with a capability to evade investigation. This comment piece examines some of the policy and legal options available to governments and law enforcement agencies to try to address this concern. While accepting the claim that this phenomenon represents a real challenge to law enforcement agencies, we currently have insufficient evidence to show the true extent of the problem. What this piece does not accept is the implication contained in the quotes, and often made explicit by others, that the use of encryption represents a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power between criminals and their investigators from what previously prevailed. Such claims tend to lack historical perspective, which is one of the themes of this 200th issue of Computer Law and Security Review. (C) 2018 Ian Walden. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The growth of internet in Pakistan is exceptional; it reached to the heights of popularity for an ever changing medium of information and communication in a major conservative society. This brings freedom of expression, communication and information across the country which struggled to provide free speech and information access to its people. The internet penetration is increasing very rapidly; it is very important to observe the impact of it on the society; especially when the government is constantly trying to formulate the regulation for controlling the cyber space. A well regulated cyber space leads to the expansion of information technology services speedily. This paper focuses on the prevailing development of governance policies for cyber space and defies among the agencies and information technology venders. Moreover, the case study of national bank of Pakistan and other cyber crime survey shows that a lot of law making is needed in order to reduce the chances of cyber crime."
The complexity, multifacetedness, and interdisciplinary status of ensuring the collection of evidence leads to the need to study it in the coordinate system set by different levels of scientific methodology. With this in mind, we consider it necessary to analyze the current issues of study methodology in ensuring evidence collection on the basis of cybercrimes. The purpose of the work is studying the criminal-legal, criminal-procedural, and forensic aspects of the methodological foundations of research in securing evidence on the example of cybercrimes. The research methodology includes such methods as the general system-structural method, the dialectical method, the historical method, the system method, the comparative-legal method, logical methods (deduction, induction, analogy, analysis, synthesis), the structural-logical method, and the modeling method. As a conclusion of the conducted research, the regulatory and legal factors that constitute the legal basis of the organizational and technical principles of the investigation of crimes in the field of cybercrime were considered, and the problematic issues of the research methodology were identified. It was concluded that the methodological support of the research of evidence collection is a complex, multifaceted task of scientific research, it can be solved only on the basis of a systematic approach to this problem.
"Online harassment, particularly cyberbullying and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, is a widespread phenomenon among adolescents and young adults. Descriptive research was carried out to investigate any differences among Italian school classes in the perception of cybercrime through a real-case scenario. Following the Italian school system, the final sample of 1777 adolescents (Mage = 15.37, SD = 1.65; Male = 52%) was divided into three groups based on the school class attended: middle school (N = 562; Mage = 13.37, SD = 0.48); high school biennium (N = 728; Mage = 15.55, SD = 0.50), and triennium (N = 487, Mage = 17.40, SD = 0.71). Participants completed a self-report questionnaire investigating the use of the Internet and the perception of a real case scenario involving the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and cyberbullying received by the National Centre for Combating Child Pornography Online (NCPO). Results showed differences among the three groups' perceptions of the event's features, motivations underlying the offense, victim-blaming and harassment justification (e.g., cyberbullying, in particular non-consensual sharing of intimate images, is recognized as a crime as age increases). The findings provide significant insights for future research and age-specific factors to consider when developing prevention programs for online risks."
From the viewpoint of cybercrime, young people represent a particularly vulnerable category of Internet users: children, adolescents and students. Young people are, undoubtedly, the most common and the most gullible users of social networks. Due to lack of education related to dangers they are exposed to on social networks, inexperienced users recklessly post information and multimedia contents on their profiles which can be misused by differently motivated Internet users. Apart from being exposed to the risk from the violation of personal privacy and misuse of personal data, young people are exposed to the risk from political or ideological manipulation. Various studies on social networks and secondary school students have been conducted in the Republic of Serbia. However, no study in this field which would look at university students has yet been conducted. The purpose of this study was to discover the extent to which students use social networking sites, but also the sources and ways students perceive online security risks associated with social networking. Study results show that the media has a dominant role in educating young people on the risks associated with social networking and that the impact of the media is greater than the impact of other educational factors such as family, school or university.
The contribution of new technology is synonym with developed nations when compares to the developing countries that commonly adopt the new technology. This paper attempts to empirically investigate the link between technology adoption and the economic growth of twelve selected developing Asian countries. The sources of technology adoption are from Mobile Cellular Subscription, Passenger Car in Use, Secure of internet Server and Fixed Telephone Line that could help in promoting economic growth of the nations. First, this study will apply three competing econometric models known as the Pooled OLS, the Random Effects Model and Fixed Effects Model to identify the suitable model that best explained the data of these nations. Next, from the model we could determine the significant sources which have effect on the economic growth of the nations. The empirical results indicate that Secure of Internet Server is the only source showing a positive significant impact on the Gross Domestic Product of these nations. Despite being the critical factor of technology adoption that would promote growth through e-commerce activities, countries are worry with the rapid increase of cybercrime threats. Hence, the movement toward sovereign control has become necessary for some countries to protect themselves from malicious cyber-attacks.
Sha Zhu Pan ((sic)), or Pig-Butchering scam, is a new online romance scam that mainly targets Chinese-speaking individuals to gain emotional trust and persuade victims to invest in a fictitious website controlled by the scammer group. The substantial economic loss forced the Chinese government to launch a series of judicial campaigns against this crime. Regardless, Sha Zhu Pan has not been significantly curbed but intensified and spread from mainland China to Southeast Asia, North America, and other regions. When procuring answers to this conundrum, no empirical studies have attempted to explore judicial aspects among Sha Zhu Pan cases in China. The purpose of this paper is to utilize focal concern theory, a conceptual framework generally applies to explain sentencing disparity, to explore whether the sentencing of Sha Zhu Pan offenders is guided by legal factors outlined in Chinese sentencing guidelines. To answer this question, this study quantitatively analyzes 172 legal cases collected from China Judgments Online. Although few inconsistent findings exist, the empirical evidence reveals that the judgments in Sha Zhu Pan cases are primarily driven by the three legal elements of the focal concern theory. The outcomes expand the focal concern theory to cybercrime sentencing in a cross-cultural context while offering insights to guide future research.
"Saudi Arabia has witnessed an exponential growth in smartphone adoption and penetration. This increase has been accompanied with an upward trend in cyber and mobile crimes. This calls to efforts that focus on enhancing the awareness of the public to security-related risks. In this study, we replicated the study performed by Albayram et al. published in SOUPS 2017; however, our study targetted participants in Saudi Arabia. We also investigated different fear appeal video designs that were more suited for this population (customized video, Arabic dubbed, and captions for the original video). The results from the original study, conducted in the United States, showed that 50% of participants in the treatment group and 21% in the control group enabled screen lock. The reason for replicating the original paper was to increase Saudis' awareness regarding the importance of sensitive data, especially with the increasing level of cybercrime. Our results showed that the Saudi-customized video was extremely effective in changing our participants' locking behavior (72.5% of participants enabled the screen lock), based on customized applications and Saudi culture. The dubbed video was the second-most effective (62.5%) locking behavior. Finally, we have illustrated our data comparison analysis in detail."
The unprecedented growth of the Internet has given rise to the Dark Web, the problematic facet of the Web associated with cybercrime, hate, and extremism. Despite the need for tools to collect and analyze Dark Web forums, the covert nature of this part of the Internet makes traditional Web crawling techniques insufficient for capturing such content. In this study, we propose a novel crawling system designed to collect Dark Web forum content. The system uses a human-assisted accessibility approach to gain access to Dark Web forums. Several URL ordering features and techniques enable efficient extraction of forum postings. The system also includes an incremental crawler coupled with a recall-improvement mechanism intended to facilitate enhanced retrieval and updating of collected content. Experiments conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the human-assisted accessibility approach and the recall-improvement-based, incremental-update procedure yielded favorable results. The human-assisted approach significantly improved access to Dark Web forums while the incremental crawler with recall improvement also outperformed standard periodic- and incremental-update approaches. Using the system, we were able to collect over 100 Dark Web forums from three regions. A case study encompassing link and content analysis of collected forums was used to illustrate the value and importance of gathering and analyzing content from such online communities.
Phishing is a cybercrime that deceives online users and steals their confidential information by impersonating a legitimate website or URL. Several machine learning-based strategies have been proposed to detect phishing websites. These techniques utilize a set of features extracted from website samples, the structure and syntax of URLs, the content of the pages, and querying external resources. In this work, we use a dataset of 11,430 samples with 87 extracted features that are designed to be used as a benchmark for machine learning-based phishing detection systems. Our classification is based on an ensemble learning technique, which is further optimized using grid search. The experiments provide a detailed description of tuning the model's hyperparameters and its optimization. We evaluate the model using well-known evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. The findings indicate that our optimized ensemble model classifies legitimate and phishing URLs with an accuracy of 95.36%, a precision of 96.29%, a recall of 94.24%, an F1 score of 95.26%, and the area under the ROC curve of 0.9876.
Investments in Indian Medical Tourism (MT) have been growing at a greater rate than the global standards. However, unfortunately, Indian legislations have not managed to keep pace with this phenomenal growth, and have thereby been lacking in forming specific amendments, coupled with both preventive and compensative decrees. Moreover, safety and security have emerged as an aggregated inter-web of complex multi-dimensional components, encompassing aspects such as public and personal data safety, legal protection of tourists, consumers protection, and so on. The internet has affected data integration, storage, exchange exposing thereby the possibilities of security breaches. All of these, in amalgamation, call for elevating the overall hygiene of India's growing medical tourism industry. Based upon this backdrop, this study looks into the theories of security, privacy, and consumerism, and the need for preventive cybercrime laws in India's medical tourism sector, especially considering several technical vulnerabilities that do exist. In this endeavor, I reviewed and analyzed journals and government policies, and have looked to identify some of the fallacies and gaps. Additionally, I also attempted to identify some of the needs that exist in MT's cybersecurity space, both within the Indian and international contexts.
The growing digitization of healthcare institutions and its increasing dependence on Internet infrastructure has boosted the concerns related to data privacy and confidentiality. These institutions have been challenged with specific issues, namely the sensitivity of data, the specificity of networked equipment, the heterogeneity of healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, administrative staff and other) and the IT skills they have. In this paper we present the results obtained with a study made with healthcare professionals on evaluating their awareness level with the information security, namely by assessing their attitudes and behaviours in cybersecurity. The methodology consisted in translating, adjusting and applying two previously validated and already published Likert-type response scales, in a healthcare institution in Portugal, namely Centro Hospitalar Barreiro Montijo (CHBM). The scales used were cybersecurity risky behaviour (RScB) and cybersecurity and cybercrime in business attitudes (ATC-IB). Although there were no significant statistical differences between the sociodemographic factors and the scores obtained on both scales, the results showed a relationship between acquired behaviours and the attitudes of involvement with work and organizational commitment, establishing a bridge for the quantification in awareness.(C) 2021 The Authors.

The digital economy has revolutionised financial service provision and compelled financial services institutions to adopt technologies that help deliver quality service at a minimal cost. Due to the recent disturbance in the financial sector in the country, there is an urgent need for financial service providers to adopt relevant technologies to help reduce operational inefficiencies and maintain service quality. This article analyses the implications of the digital economy for enhancing the efficiency of financial markets. Drawing the existing literature, it concludes that the financial institutions in the country have quite embraced and integrated digitisation into their activities. Given the perceived high level of digital illiteracy among the populace, it was surprising to discover the number of people who have signed on unto such financial products. It was recommended financial institutions integrate their operations with the necessary digital technologies as it helps reduce operational costs. Furthermore, they need to invest in digital infrastructure and skills of their staff to embrace technology in service delivery. It is also suggested that policymakers strengthen the laws, policies, and regulations such as data protection and cybercrime to enable the players of the market to operate freely and confidently.
The extreme growth of Internet resources leads to several kinds of attacks. Cybercrime is one of the dominant threats apart from data defence mechanism, which enhances the economy, resource management, and service quality. Among them, HTTP flooding attacks in the cloud are one of the most prevalent threats as it depletes the cloud resources and services. It is difficult to distinguish the anomalous traffic by extracting the actual payload since most of the payload could not be accessed as they are encrypted and varies dynamically based on the user input. Hence, the proposed method uses web server logs that can be easily accessed to detect the attacks. This study highlights the detection methods by extracting the features from the web server logs and also deals with the reduction in the dimensionality of the features using diffusion map. The anomalies are detected by affinity propagation clustering technique and also by monitoring the status of the virtual machine. Furthermore, the Dempster-Shafer theory focuses on the identification of the suspicious user. It is inferred from the experimental results that the proposed method enhances the detection performance with very few false alarms than existing methods.
The past few years have witnessed millions of credit/debit cards flowing through the underground economy and ultimately causing significant financial loss. Examining key underground economy sellers has both practical and academic significance for cybercrime forensics and criminology research. Drawing on social media analytics, we have developed the AZSecure text mining system for identifying and profiling key sellers. The system identifies sellers using sentiment analysis of customer reviews and profiles sellers using topic modeling of advertisements. We evaluated the AZSecure system on eight international underground economy forums. The system significantly outperformed all benchmark machine-learning methods on identifying advertisement threads, classifying customer review sentiments, and profiling seller characteristics, with an average F-measure of about 80 percent to 90 percent. In our case study, we identified the famous carder, Rescator, who was affiliated with the Target breach, and captured important seller characteristics in terms of product type, payment options, and contact channels. Our research leverages social media analytics to probe into the underground economy in order to help law enforcement target key sellers and prevent future fraud. It also contributes to our understanding of the use of information technology in detecting deception in online systems.
In the past five years cybercrime has grown to become one of the most significant threats to the safety of the nation and its economy. The government's call to arms has been eagerly accepted by business enterprises and academia. But training cyber security professionals raises a unique set of challenges. Cost, space, time and scalability are among the issues identified and possible solutions proposed. As a cyber-security professionals, we have realized the importance of practical experience which can be hard to deliver in a lecture based environment. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate and recommend a platform for Virtual handson Labs which may be used to provide a secure environment for cyber security students to evaluate and receive hands-on experience on possible threats and countermeasures. There are similar labs setup in different universities across the world but we have not been able to find any studies evaluating the virtualization platforms for their merit in order to run a virtual lab. Hence we study three of the most popular virtualization platforms and recommendations are provided to guide anyone who desires to setup such a lab.
Cybersecurity finds widespread applications across diverse domains, encompassing intelligent industrial systems, residential environments, personal gadgets, and automobiles. This has spurred groundbreaking advancements while concurrently posing persistent challenges in addressing security concerns tied to IoT devices. IoT intrusion detection involves using sophisticated techniques, including deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and anomaly detection algorithms, to identify unauthorized or malicious activities within IoT ecosystems. These systems continuously monitor and analyze network traffic and device behavior, seeking patterns that deviate from established norms. When anomalies are detected, security measures are triggered to thwart potential threats. IoT intrusion detection is vital for safeguarding data integrity, ensuring users' privacy, and maintaining critical systems' reliability and safety. As the IoT landscape evolves, effective intrusion detection mechanisms become increasingly essential to mitigate the ever-growing spectrum of cyber threats. Practical security approaches, notably deep learning-based intrusion detection, have been introduced to tackle these issues. This study utilizes deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRUs), while introducing an ensemble deep learning architectural framework that integrates a voting policy within the model's structure, thereby facilitating the computation and learning of hierarchical patterns. In our analysis, we compared the performance of ensemble deep learning classifiers with traditional deep learning techniques. The standout models were CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU, achieving impressive accuracies of 99.7% and 99.6%, along with exceptional F1-scores of 0.998 and 0.997, respectively.
Although it is generally acknowledged that the development of the Internet created new criminal opportunities, the ways this is experienced by the general population has received limited attention. The current study seeks to explore the degrees to which people report fear of online crime, its correlates, and how online fear is related to protective and avoidance behaviour. We focus on online financial crimes. Results based on a large, representative, survey indicate an intermediate level of fear of online crime among the general Dutch population. Various sociodemographic characteristics and victimization experiences are shown to predict fear of online financial crime. We also find online fear to be a strong predictor of avoidance behaviour, given negative relationships with online purchasing and banking, thereby impeding individuals' perceived online freedom and opportunities. Finally, the results found no indications that fear may stimulate protective behaviour of one's computer.
"Cyberattacks are committed by one or more people using a computer equipped with many viruses. The damage can be physical or moral. Cyberattacks are also often attacks on the information system with the purpose of changing, adding, or falsifying data, causing the disruption of a computer, or destroying information programs, whether economic, commercial, or military. This paper aimed to identify the international responsibility in incidents of cyberattacks in the light of contemporary international law. The study used a thematic content analysis research design to identify a few constructs namely legal adaptations of cyber-attacks, technological development; jurisprudence and international responsibility. The data was collected through juridical and descriptive methods from documentation and other legal sources. The study found that countries lack cyber legislation, there are significant legal gaps it is very difficult to place cyberattacks within the existing international legal framework. The study recommends that nations should work to achieve cyber security and preserve the rights resulting from the legitimate use of computers and information networks. It is also necessary to address the legislative gaps in fighting cybercrime and the necessity of enacting legislation that covers this gap to reach safe cyberspace."
"The preparation of a graduate level cyber security and forensics course in a computer science department that addresses theory, policy, and application for a multidisciplinary student audience can be daunting when the majority of students in the class do not have a computer science background. The course takes a holistic approach to broaden knowledge and deepen understanding of the domain of cyber security using cross disciplinary teams to gain understanding and experience taking theory to practice and practice to theory. A framework of understanding is built through the examination of the body of scholarly conceptual and technical works and hands on experience with hardware and software platforms and networks. Computer Science provides the theoretical underpinnings and technical details, methods, and tools to examine security concepts; Forensic Science provides the approach to critical analysis of digital evidence; and Behavioral Analysis provided a way to synthesize knowledge and scientific method to gain some understanding of criminal behavior as well as the breadth and economic impact of cybercrime. This approach resulted in students who gained technical proficiency and perspective and experience working with people with divergent backgrounds, abilities and knowledge sets."
The modern digital internet economy and billions of dollars of trade are made possible by the internet security which is provided by operating system and web browser developers. This paper provides a survey of how this security is implemented through the use of digital certificates and the Public Key Infrastructure. Documented cases of the abuse of these digital certificates are given. It is shown that these problems arise from a combination of commercial pressures and a failure of the designers of internet security to consider the fundamental security principal of least privilege. Measures which are used to mitigate these problems are noted and new PKI architectural components which are designed to correct existing problems are examined.
The prevalence and rapid growth of cybercrime are largely attributed to hacker communities on the dark web, where cybercriminals extensively exchange hacking resources, share hacking knowledge, and organize cyberattacks. Such streams of hacker-generated content constitute an invaluable data source for developing threat intelligence that can inform organizations of cybersecurity risks and facilitate proactive cyber defense. Drawing upon the design science paradigm, we propose a novel nonparametric emerging topic detection (NPETD) framework for detecting emerging topics in streams of hacker -generated content. Our framework extends the state-of-the-art nonparametric topic model to inductively model topics without having to specify the number of topics a priori. Moreover, our framework features an efficient algorithm to jointly infer topics and detect topic emergence. We conducted experiments to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in comparison with the state-of-the-art baseline methods. Our framework outperformed the baseline methods in detecting the listings of emerging threats in darknet marketplaces on recall, F-measure, topic coherence, and processor time. The practical utility of our framework is further demonstrated in a major hacker forum, where we identified several notable emerging topics with important implications for victim companies and law enforcement. The proposed framework contributes to cybersecurity, topic detection and tracking, and design science.
School systems may pay attention to the fact that individuals and companies using smart devices are increasingly at risk of becoming victims of cybercrime. The literature on how effective students in developed countries such as the Netherlands are taught about cyber security skills during their school career is scarce. Although curriculum materials are available, scaling up computer science education is behind. Therefore, this study explores to what extent Dutch students develop cyber secure behavior at elementary and high school. A questionnaire was used for self-assessment of cyber security behavior. After the questionnaire was completed, two group interviews were conducted to improve the interpretation of the questionnaire results. The study findings revealed that the Dutch school curriculum hardly pays attention to this topic and that students acquire their online behavior mainly through experience, instructions on the internet, through parents, and through siblings. In addition, many students developed more reckless behavior over time. We recommend that cyber security education should start at elementary school as soon as children begin to use online equipment. A subject that deserves special attention is recognizing phishing emails and phishing websites. The learners should be convinced that risky behavior on the internet may turn against them and against the organization to which they belong.
Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have influenced almost every field including computer science, robotics, social engineering, psychology, criminology and so on. Although AI has solved various challenges, potential security threats of AI algorithms and training data have been stressed by AI researchers. As AI system inherits security threats of traditional computer system, the concern about novel cyberattack enhanced by AI is also growing. In addition, AI is deeply connected to physical space (e.g. autonomous vehicle, intelligent virtual assistant), so AI-related crime can harm people physically, beyond the cyberspace. In this context, we represent a literature review of security threats and AI-related crime. Based on the literature review, this article defines the term AI crime and classifies AI crime into 2 categories: AI as tool crime and AI as target crime, inspired by a taxonomy of cybercrime: Computer as tool crime and Computer as tool crime. Through the proposed taxonomy, foreseeable AI crimes are systematically studied and related forensic techniques are also addressed. We also analyze the characteristics of the AI crimes and present challenges that are difficult to be solved with the traditional forensic techniques. Finally, open issues are presented, with emphasis on the need to establish novel strategies for AI forensics.
The digitalization of our society is only possible in secure software systems governing ongoing critical processes. The understanding of mutual interdependencies of events and processes is crucial for cybersecurity. One of the promising ways to tackle these challenges is process mining, which is a set of techniques that aim to mine knowledge from processes. However, it is unclear how process mining can be practically used in the context of cybersecurity. In this work, we investigate the potential of applying process mining in cybersecurity and support research efforts in this area via collecting existing applications, discussing current trends, and providing promising research directions. To this end, we have conducted a systematic literature review covering all relevant works between 2014 and 2020.
Cybersecurity research relies on relevant datasets providing researchers a snapshot of network traffic generated by current users and modern applications and services. The lack of datasets coming from a realistic network environment leads to inefficiency of newly designed methods that are not useful in practice. This data article provides network traffic flows and event logs (Linux and Windows) from a two-day cyber defense exercise involving attackers, defenders, and fictitious users operating in a virtual exercise network . The data are stored as structured JSON, including data schemes and data dictionaries, ready for direct processing. Network topology of the exercise network in NetJSON format is also provided.

This article aims to provide more insight into pedophilic attraction and risk and protective factors for offending in nonclinical pedophiles. Fifteen participants were interviewed about sexuality, coping, and sexual self-regulation. Many participants struggled with acknowledging pedophilic interest in early puberty and experienced psychological difficulties as a result. Furthermore, many committed sex offenses during adolescence when they were still discovering their feelings. Early recognition of risk factors and early start of interventions seem vital in preventing offending. Moreover, results suggest that risk for offending can be diminished by creating more openness about pedophilia and by providing pedophiles with social support and control.
With the increase in reliance upon technology in our everyday lives, users are more vulnerable than ever to cybercrime and data security breaches. Whilst it is important, and valued, to develop technology-based interventions to mitigate this risk, it is also important to consider the impact of human error on cyber safety, and how this can be measured. Data collected from a diverse sample of 189 participants using an alternative measurement scale to more traditional Likert scales, the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), was adopted for previously researched measures of individual differences (age, gender, education level, personality, decision-making style, risk-taking preferences, acceptance of the internet, and related Theory of Planned Behavior and Protection-Motivation Theory concepts) to expand understanding of the relationships between individual differences and user-end cybersecurity behaviors, and explore the significance of this alternative measure in the field of Cyber Psychology. Findings demonstrate the use of VAS can be a reliable and valid method capable of identifying a variety of potential human vulnerabilities and strengths on an individual level. These findings highlight the importance of considering a human-centered approach to cyber-security, and future research should consider then importance of these individual differences in tailoring practical interventions.
The article discusses the main trends in information security, reflected in the judicial practice of the Russian Federation in the last period. The authors made a conclusion that modern judicial practice today considers various aspects of cases related to information security. These are cases related to violation of confidentiality of information, disclosure of personal data, falsification of electronic documents, unauthorized access to computer information, distribution of malicious computer programs, violation of information protection rules, illegal activities in the field of information protection, disclosure of information with limited access, violation of order posting information, etc. Every year the number of such cases pending before the courts is growing. This confirms the relevance of the considered problem and indicates the need to return to its consideration in the near future.
Authorship analysis has been used successfully to analyse the provenance of source code files in previous studies. The source code for Zeus, one of the most damaging and effective botnets to date, was leaked in 2011. In this research, we analyse the source code from the lens of authorship clustering, aiming to estimate how many people wrote this malware, and what their roles are. The research provides insight into the structure the went into creating Zeus and its evolution over time. The work has potential to be used to link the malware with other malware written by the same authors, helping investigations, classification, deterrence and detection.
Image reconstruction is particularly difficult when the type of image degradations are unknown. This may be the case if the acquisition device is unknown or the images stem from an uncontrolled environment like the internet. Yet, it may be important to reconstruct a specific piece of information from the image, such as digits from signs or vehicle license plates. Existing works incorporate such prior information with a sequential super-resolution and classification pipeline. However, this approach is prone to error propagation. In this work, we propose a new approach of connecting classification and super-resolution in parallel within a multi-task network. We show that this architecture is able to preserve structures and to remove noisy pixels although the network itself has never been trained on noisy data. We also show that this design allows to transparently trade classification and super-resolution quality. On upsampling by factor 4, we outperform sequential approaches in terms of SSIM by 10% and improve classification by 69%.
Abusers increasingly use spyware apps, account compromise, and social engineering to surveil their intimate partners, causing substantial harms that can culminate in violence. This form of privacy violation, termed intimate partner surveillance (IPS), is a profoundly challenging problem to address due to the physical access and trust present in the relationship between the target and attacker. While previous research has examined IPS from the perspectives of survivors, we present the first measurement study of online forums in which (potential) attackers discuss IPS strategies and techniques. In domains such as cybercrime, child abuse, and human trafficking, studying the online behaviors of perpetrators has led to better threat intelligence and techniques to combat attacks. We aim to provide similar insights in the context of IPS. We identified five online forums containing discussion of monitoring cellphones and other means of surveilling an intimate partner, including three within the context of investigating relationship infidelity. We perform a mixed-methods analysis of these forums, surfacing the tools and tactics that attackers use to perform surveillance. Via qualitative analysis of forum content, we present a taxonomy of IPS strategies used and recommended by attackers, and synthesize lessons for technologists seeking to curb the spread of IPS.
Phishing attack is a cybercrime that can lead to severe financial losses for Internet users and entrepreneurs. Typically, phishers are fond of using fuzzy techniques during the creation of a website. They confuse the victim by imitating the appearance and content of a legitimate website. In addition, many websites are vulnerable to phishing attacks, including financial institutions, social networks, e-commerce, and airline websites. This paper is an extension of our previous work that leverages the favicon with Google image search to reveal the identity of a website. Our identity retrieval technique involves an effective mathematical model that can be used to assist in retrieving the right identity from the many entries of the search results. In this paper, we introduced an enhanced version of the favicon-based phishing attack detection with the introduction of the Domain Name Amplification feature and incorporation of addition features. Additional features are very useful when the website being examined does not have a favicon. We have collected a total of 5,000 phishing websites from PhishTank and 5,000 legitimate websites from Alexa to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. From the experimental results, we achieved a 96.93% true positive rate with only a 4.13% false positive rate.
Cybersecurity controls are deployed to manage risks posed by malicious behaviours or systems. What is not often considered or articulated is how cybersecurity controls may impact legitimate users (often those whose use of a managed system needs to be protected, and preserved). This oversight characterises the 'blunt' nature of many cybersecurity controls. Here we present a framework produced from consideration of concerns across methods from cybercrime opportunity reduction and behaviour change, and existing risk management guidelines. We illustrate the framework and its principles with a range of examples and potential applications, including management of suspicious emails in organizations, and social media controls. The framework describes a capacity to improve the precision of cybersecurity controls by examining shared determinants of negative and positive behaviours in a system. This identifies opportunities for risk owners to better protect legitimate users while simultaneously acting to prevent malicious activity in a managed system. We describe capabilities for a novel approach to managing sociotechnical cyber risk which can be integrated alongside elements of typical risk management processes. This includes consideration of user activities as a system asset to protect, and a consideration of how to engage with other stakeholders in the identification of behaviours to preserve in a system.
Prevention of cybercrime is one of the missions of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) aiming to protect and guarantee sovereignty in the cyberspace. In this regard, online sex crimes are among the principal ones to prevent, especially those where a child is abused. The paper at hand proposes C3-Sex, a smart chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with suspects in order to profile their interest regarding online child sexual abuse. This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation. The ACE is designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies that constitute the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and calculate a set of 25 features that describes the suspect's behavior. After 50 days of experiments, the chatbot generated a dataset with 7199 profiling vectors with the features associated to each suspect. Afterward, we applied an unsupervised method to describe the results that differentiate three groups, which we categorize as indifferent, interested, and pervert. Exhaustive analysis is conducted to validate the applicability and advantages of our solution.
Today, the Internet covers worldwide. All over the world, people prefer an E-commerce platform to buy or sell their products. Therefore, cybercrime has become the center of attraction for cyber attackers in cyberspace. Phishing is one such technique where the unidentified structure of the Internet has been used by attackers/criminals that intend to deceive users with the use of the illusory website and emails for obtaining their credentials (like account numbers, passwords, and PINs). Consequently, the identification of a phishing or legitimate web page is a challenging issue due to its semantic structure. In this paper, a phishing detection system is implemented using deep learning techniques to prevent such attacks. The system works on URLs by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the phishing webpage. In paper vertical bar 19 vertical bar the proposed model has achieved 97.98% accuracy whereas our proposed system achieved accuracy of 98.00% which is better than earlier model. This system doesn't require any feature engineering as the CNN extract features from the URLs automatically through its hidden layers. This is other advantage of the proposed system over earlier reported in vertical bar 19 vertical bar as the feature engineering is a very time-consuming task.
In our current society, the role of IT&C has become and is becoming increasingly prevalent in all activity fields: medicine, pharmacy, industry, finance - banking, public administration, education, research, aeronautics, national security. The transfer of a substantial volume of the daily activity in the IT&C field inherently imposed the transfer of an equivalent volume of information in the same informatics environment, which has led to the emergence and expansion of the IT&C criminal phenomenon. Due to the immense negative impact they have in terms of the degree of expansion, of the amount of damages, of the difficulty of investigating offences belonging to the cybercrime field, of the difficulty of locating and identifying the offenders, as well as due to the transnational character of these activities, offences pertaining to the informatics criminality are regarded in the new criminal legislation as being on the same level of gravity as genocide against humanity and war crimes, offences against national security, against the fighting capacity of the armed forces, offences relating to the Romanian state border, offences relating civil aeronautics activities and those that may endanger the safety of flights and aviation security, offences against the financial interests of the European Union [1].
Biometrics-based authentication systems are presented as an alternative solution to the traditional authentication techniques, these systems have more security advantages compared to a password as biometric data cannot be forgotten or wasted. However, the protection of biometric systems against different types of attacks is not yet guaranteed. While many studies are proposed in order to increase the security of biometric systems, several attacks are developed in order to exploit the weaknesses of these systems. In this paper, we present a new alteration attack on biometric authentication systems. We suppose that the impostor has altered image of the real user and he presents it as request in order to gain unlawful access to the system. Altered image can be recuperated from a fingerprint trace in case of fingerprint based systems or user photograph for attacking face based authentication systems. Next, we study the impact of alteration level on the matching score for fingerprint and face based biometric systems. Our analysis shows that both systems are vulnerable to the proposed attack and the alteration level has serious impact on the security of biometric systems. The impostor can have a matching score greater than 90% for the tested fingerprint based biometric system and 190/194 associations are matched for the tested face based biometric authentication system.
In the context of contemporary data, the processing of information is crucial. This paper proposes an extension to the traditional database relational algebra, which enriches the data model and provides additional complex-data operations. Specifically, we focus on analytical operators from the areas of data mining and similarity search, such as frequent pattern mining or similarity search queries. The proposed approach can be easily extended by additional algebraic operators. To demonstrate the capabilities of our analytical algebra, we show three practical use cases with different levels of the expression complexity.
With the increasing adoption of microservice architecture and popularity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud, software architecture design is in many domains leaning towards composition of loosely interconnected services hosted in the PaaS cloud, which in comparison to traditional multitier applications introduces new design challenges that software architects need to face when aiming at high scalability and resilience. In this paper, we study the key design decisions made during microservice architecture design and deployment in PaaS cloud. We identify major challenges of microservice architecture design in the context of the PaaS cloud, and examine the effects of architectural tactics and design patterns in addressing them. We apply selected tactics on a sample e-commerce application, constituting of microservices operated by Azure Service Fabric and utilizing other supportive PaaS cloud services within Microsoft Azure. The impact of the examined design decisions on the throughput, response time and scalability of the analyzed application is evaluated and discussed.
The purpose of email spam is to advertise to sell, phishing attacks, DDOS attacks and many more. Many solutions of various kinds such as blacklisting, whitelisting, grey-listing, content filtering have been proposed at the sender and receiver levels. There has been some level of success but the email spam still hits the inbox and more so the problem is false positives and false negatives. The current filtering solutions used are mostly a combination of few of the available techniques, the most common being a combination of listing and content filtering techniques. Apart from any attacks, email spam causes a great loss in resources and productivity of the user. Apart from this, this problem of false negatives exists as there is non-existence of filters to address user's preferences and behaviors, timing of the day and year. The filters at the mail servers are trained with spam and ham training data that is generic in nature. Hence, there is need to address this problem. This paper aims to address all of the above i.e. an email that hits a particular users inbox by escaping the mail server spam filtering solutions. To do this, this paper describes the problem of spam, followed by the filtering mechanisms, techniques, learning email filter model and then proposes a model to fine tune the filter to increase the efficiency.
With the growing use of IoT devices in the private domain, people's homes become increasingly connected to and reachable via the Internet. This is convenient, but also makes homes vulnerable and introduces security risks that go beyond classical IT issues. Cyber threats evolve to cyberphysical ones, opening new pathways for cybercriminals. In practice, most cybercrime attacks happen because of the failure to recognize and deal with (technical as well as human) security gaps and operating errors. There is no lack of technological means and advice to ensure secure operation of systems, but it is usually people with technical background who define these concepts only/mainly based on technical reasoning. The actual users are rarely figured in, which increases the probability that security measures are not practical. This paper reports on a multidisciplinary study on the use of smart devices as well as perception of and experience with Internet security in Austrian households. Contrary to usual engineering approaches, the study was designed to be quantitative and representative according to social science research principles. It revealed that the use of smart devices in private homes is still relatively low and that security incidents are less frequent than might be suspected, but that users also have an ambivalent perception of (in)security.
The security of information is among the greatest challenges facing organizations and institutions. Cybercrime has risen in frequency and magnitude in recent years, with new ways to steal, change and destroy information or disable information systems appearing every day. Among the types of penetration into the information systems where confidential information is processed is malware. An attacker injects malware into a computer system, after which he has full or partial access to critical information in the information system. This paper proposes an ensemble classification-based methodology for malware detection. The first-stage classification is performed by a stacked ensemble of dense (fully connected) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), while the final stage classification is performed by a meta-learner. For a meta-learner, we explore and compare 14 classifiers. For a baseline comparison, 13 machine learning methods are used: K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Radial basis function (RBF) SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, ExtraTrees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic, Neural Net, Passive Classifier, Ridge Classifier and Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier. We present the results of experiments performed on the Classification of Malware with PE headers (ClaMP) dataset. The best performance is achieved by an ensemble of five dense and CNN neural networks, and the ExtraTrees classifier as a meta-learner.
In this new era of life, where technology covers our life from the early morning to late night, cybercrime is becoming more developed and challenging for the systems designers. The reason is reflected in the increased number of ways used by criminals. Cloud computing systems are natural goals due to their complexity and increasing popularity. The Cloud system provides an environment with a big number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that available to many users accessing this system via the Internet. This way of access makes cloud systems weaker than physical networks. In order to reduce the number of attacks and secure data storage, any malicious behaviour should be discovered and halted if possible. In this paper, we focus on discovery of malicious behaviour via determining unwanted symptoms rather than via targeting particular malicious behaviour of the system directly. The main motivation for our approach is that malicious behaviour (e.g., a new form of threat) is very often hard to specify directly, but it can be characterized by a set of undesired symptoms. The main contribution of this paper refers to several new mechanisms for monitoring Virtual Machines and further experimental work targeting efficient ways of visiting VMs in order to discover malicious symptoms.
This study is analyzing the relationship between traditional money laundry scheme and the electronic payments development and also the contribution of the Internet development in promoting illegal transactions originated from domestic or foreign markets. The links between terrorism financing, money laundering, cybercrime and traditional criminal activity seems to be clear. In this context, the paper is focusing on the potential money laundering and terrorist financing implications of payment innovations that gave customers the opportunity to carry out payments directly through technical devices such as personal computers, mobile phones or data storage cards. In many cases these payments could be carried out without Me customer needing an individual bank account. The research tries to identify money laundering typologies and red flags indicators that may occur in electronic payments system in order to create behaviour maps, models and suspicious activity rule bases for each of them. Moreover, the study tried to create a link between the theoretical issues and the practical schemes of electronic money laundry. Organized crime, arms smuggling, tax evasion and fraud in its many varieties entail significant laundering of funds. It remains difficult to assess the scale of the money laundering problem, but there is general agreement that it amounts of two to five percent of global GDP would probably be a consensus range.
The proliferations of the mobile intelligent terminal have brought them to the spotlight of the attackers for the sensitive information they carried. However, the current security schemes on the mobile intelligent terminal are fragile. This paper proposed a new transparent authentication and encryption measure to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data on the mobile intelligent terminal. Our method is user-friendly as no interaction is needed during the process. Also, the result can be applied as evidence to identify who have used the phone.
In an era in which social media platforms are proliferating and becoming primary communication channels, the identification of evidence for crimes from such platforms is crucial for digital forensics and legal proceedings. This paper presents a novel approach for systematically structuring and categorising digital attributes that are interlinked across social media platforms using digital ontologies, as well as a method for user profiling using domain-specific digital artefacts. The ontology models consist of classes with subclass distinctions for text, image, and video types of evidence. These models are flexible and can be expanded to include various social media platforms and evidence categories. Simultaneously, the user profiling method employs mathematical formulas and visual representations to develop comprehensive profiles of individuals based on extracted social media data. This methodology evaluates the relevance of a set of digital artefacts and related attributes, such as interests, location, and activities, using their weights. Additionally, the research addresses the legal and ethical considerations pertinent to the collection of data from social media. Despite the approaches' immense potential for expediting evidence collection and developing insightful profiles, obstacles such as scalability, legal complexities, and data noise are identified. This work makes a substantial contribution to the development of digital forensics and cybercrime investigations involving social media platforms.
The emergence of the Internet and web technologies has magnified the occurrence of disinformation events and the dissemination of online fake news items. Fake news is a phenomenon where fake news stories are created and propagated online. Such events occur with ever increasing frequency, they reach a wide audience, and they can have serious real-life consequences. As a result, disinformation events are raising critical public interest concerns as in many cases online news stories of fake and disturbing events have been perceived as being truthful. However, even at a conceptual level, there is not a comprehensive approach to what constitutes fake news with regard to the further classification of individual occurrences and the detection/mitigation of actions. This work identifies the emergent properties and entities involved in fake news incidents and constructs a disinformation blueprint (DCAM-DB) based on cybercrime incident architecture. To construct the DCAM-DB in an articulate manner, the authors present an overview of the properties and entities involved in fake news and disinformation events based on the relevant literature and identify the most prevalent challenges. This work aspires to enable system implementations towards the detection, classification, assessment, and mitigation of disinformation events and to provide a foundation for further quantitative and longitudinal research on detection strategies.
The advent of the Android system has brought smartphone technology to the doorsteps of the masses. The latest technologies have made it affordable for every section of the society. However, the emergence of the Android platform has also escalated the growth of cybercrime through the mobile platform. Its open source operating system has made it a center of attraction for the attackers. This article provides a comprehensive study of the state of the Android Security domain. This article classifies the attacks on the Android system in four categories (i) hardware-based attacks, (ii) kernel-based attacks, (iii) hardware abstraction layer-based attacks, and (iv) application-based attacks. The study deals with various threats and security measures relating to these categories and presents an in-depth analysis of the underlying problems in the Android security domain. The article also stresses the role of Android application developers in realizing a more secure Android environment. This article attempts to provide a comparative analysis of various malware detection techniques concerning their methods and limitations. The study can help researchers gain knowledge of the Android security domain from various aspects and build a more comprehensive, robust, and efficient solution to the threats that Android is facing.
Phishing is a cybercrime in which, attackers try to fraudulently retrieve users' credentials by mimicking trusted communication channels. The problem with phishing is that attackers still able to bypass anti-phishing automated systems through the human factor. It is not enough, therefore, to only add new technologies, aware users might play the key role in stopping phishing attacks. Based on that, phishing problem requires defense solutions that to be applied at both of the technical (automated systems) and non-technical (human) aspects. Phishing attacks, in general, are initiated through simulated emails with a false claim of being sent from trusted parties. The work in this paper is dedicated to fighting phishing threats at email's level in order to kill this type of attacks in the cradle. Users, therefore, are protected at a level which is prior of browsing phishing web pages. This paper proposes an anti-phishing model that designed based on the general taxonomy of the technical and non-technical aspects of phishing detection approaches. This paper, in addition, presents the general structure of the proposed anti-phishing system that developed based on the herein proposed model. The novelty of this model is the approach of combining both of the automated procedures with users' anti-phishing training method to detect phishing emails.
The anti-forensics (AF) technology has become a new field of cybercrime. The problems of existing forensic technologies should be considered from criminals' perspective, so as to make improvement to existing AF technologies. There are two types of AF methods, namely, data hiding and destruction, where most AF tools are primarily based on data hiding. If the data can be intercepted by investigators during the AF process, the remaining data may be destroyed by the criminal, which would make investigators obtain nothing about data information. To address this issue, this paper proposes an AF scheme with multi-device storage based on Reed-Solomon codes by combining data hiding and data destruction. The data is divided into multiple out-of-order data blocks and parity blocks, where these blocks are stored separately in different devices. This method can reduce the storage cost and protect the privacy of data. Even if the data is destroyed, it allows AF investigators to recover the data. Security analysis showed that this AF method can prevent malicious, erroneous or invalid files while acquired and ensure data security in data stolen. Theoretical analysis indicated that this method was difficult for investigators but easy for AFer in files recovery. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and has practical efficiency.
"In this study we report our research on learning an accurate and easily interpretable classifier model for authorship classification of typewritten digital texts. For this purpose we use Ant Colony Optimization; a meta-heuristic based on swarm intelligence. Unlike black box type classifiers, the decision making rules produced by the proposed method are understandable by people familiar to the domain and can be easily enhanced with the addition of domain knowledge. Our experimental results show that the method is feasible and more accurate than decision trees."
Machine learning (ML) is currently a crucial tool in the field of cyber security. Through the identification of patterns, the mapping of cybercrime in real time, and the execution of in-depth penetration tests, ML is able to counter cyber threats and strengthen security infrastructure. Security in any organization depends on monitoring and analyzing user actions and behaviors. Due to the fact that it frequently avoids security precautions and does not trigger any alerts or flags, it is much more challenging to detect than traditional malicious network activity. ML is an important and rapidly developing anomaly detection field in order to protect user security and privacy, a wide range of applications, including various social media platforms, have incorporated cutting-edge techniques to detect anomalies. A social network is a platform where various social groups can interact, express themselves, and share pertinent content. By spreading propaganda, unwelcome messages, false information, fake news, and rumours, as well as by posting harmful links, this social network also encourages deviant behavior. In this research, we introduce Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Triple DES, a hybrid approach to anomaly detection in unbalanced classification. The results show that the DBN-TDES model can typically detect anomalous user behaviors that other models in anomaly detection cannot.
The world of Internet as such is open and insecure by nature. Companies and organizations exploit enormous possibilities that internet offers to build computer systems to enable communication and data sharing capabilities within their corporate platforms. In doing so, they continuously strive towards providing a fast, efficient and at the same time secure working environment by protecting their organizational assets. Enterprises build their network infrastructure with intention to find reliable solutions to protect themselves from untrusted and cybercrime activities. In this sense, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are primarily concerned about Data privacy. VPNs represent an extension of a private network made through added features like encapsulating the data packets with a header on both ends, along the lines of the communication as well as throughout setting communication tunnels using composite suite of protocols available. This paper offers a set of simulated secure data communication tunnels together with a comparison of results of the speed variables measured against the security through different encryption protocols between remote LAN's. These encryption protocols are ran onto distributed queries using various database functions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cybercrime has been the focus of public attention during the last decade. However, within the criminological field, no prior research initiatives have been launched in an effort to better understand this phenomenon using computer network data. Addressing this challenge, we employ the classical routine-activities and lifestyle perspective to raise hypotheses regarding the trends and origin of computer-focused crime incidents (i.e. computer exploits, port scans, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks) against a large university computer network. We first propose that computer-focused crimes against a university network are determined by the university users' daily activity patterns. In addition, we hypothesize that the social composition of the network users determines the origin of computer attacks against the university network. We use data recorded between the years 2007 and 2009 by an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to test these claims. Consistently with our theoretical expectations, two important findings emerge. First, computer attacks are more likely to occur during university official business hours. Second, an increase in the number of foreign network users substantially increases the number of computer-focused crimes originating from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses linked with these users' countries of origin. Future directions for subsequent studies are discussed.
This research proves the failure to address theoretically fundamental issues of robots' legal capacity and cyber security and as a result crudity of issues concerning criminal liability of robots for their actions. The proposals of a number of Spanish scientists on the possibility of non-proliferation of the sphere of criminal law on robots in connection with the existing possibility of criminal prosecution of legal entities in Spain have been worked out. In retrospect, the Spanish concepts of criminal responsibility of artificial intelligence were studied: their novels, shortcomings and problems of application in modern conditions were revealed.
Email is an essential communication tool for modern people and offers a variety of functions. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the importance of emails enhanced further as non-face-to-face work increased. However, with the spread and dissemination of emails, cybercrime that abused emails has also increased. The number of cases of stealing or damaging email users by impersonating public institutions such as the National Police Agency, the Prosecutor's Office, or the WHO. This study proposes an advanced algorithm of email classification using an SMTP response code to strengthen the level of email security. The proposed system is located on the side of the recipient's email server and operates upon receipt of the email. When an email is received, it automatically verifies whether the domain of the email sender is normally registered in DNS. Thereafter, MX, SPF, and PTR records are extracted and combined to determine the state of the sending server. When additional verification is required, a proposed algorithm automatically connects the communication session to the sender to request the SMTP response code. The proposed algorithm was applied to two organizations and succeeded in classifying received emails into various categories. This study contributes to the literature on email classification by presenting new ideas in the process of sender verification.
With the emergence of blockchain-based multi-party trading scenarios, such as finance, government work, and supply chain management. Information on the blockchain poses a serious threat to users' privacy, and anonymous transactions become the most urgent need. At present, solutions to the realization of anonymous transactions can only achieve a certain degree of trader identity privacy and transaction content privacy, so we introduce zero knowledge proof to achieve complete privacy. At the same time, unconditional privacy provides conditions for cybercrime. Due to the great application potential of the blockchain in many fields, supporting privacy protection and supervision simultaneously in the blockchain is a bottleneck, and existing works can not solve the problem of coexistence of privacy protection and supervision. This paper takes the lead in studying the privacy and supervision in multi-party anonymous transactions, and proposes a distributed anonymous payment scheme with supervision (DAPS) based on zk-SNARK, signature, commitment and elliptic curve cryptography, which enables users to be anonymous under supervision in transactions. The advantages of DAPS are twofold: enhanced privacy and additional supervision. We formally discussed the security of the whole system framework provided by the zero-knowledge proof, and verified its feasibility and practicability in the open source blockchain framework BCOS.
"To controlling the information flows between the competing companies (CC) in the cloud computing (Multi-tenancy) or in the social network, the Chinese wall security policy (CWSP) is very interesting solution. Its rule is the building of the walls between the CC. The CWSPs idea, is the building of impenetrable wall among subject, and this to controlling the information flow between the CC, caused by the subjects. However, the preview proposed models [1-6]; they have a set of errors and they can't fix the composite information flows (CIF) problem between the CC (a malicious Trojan horses problem). In this article; we will propose a new approach based on the access query type of the subject to the objects and the philosophy of the CWSP. In our model we have two types walls placement, the first are built around the subject, and the second around the object; which, we can't find inside each once wall two competing objects data."
Cryptocurrency abuse has become a critical problem. Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, criminals commonly adopt cryptocurrency for trading drugs and deceiving people without revealing their identities. Despite its significance and severity, only few works have studied how cryptocurrency has been abused in the real world, and they only provide some limited measurement results. Thus, to provide a more in-depth understanding on the cryptocurrency abuse cases, we present a large-scale analysis on various Bitcoin abuse types using 200,507 realworld reports collected by victims from 214 countries. We scrutinize observable abuse trends, which are closely related to real-world incidents, to understand the causality of the abuses. Furthermore, we investigate the semantics of various cryptocurrency abuse types to show that several abuse types overlap in meaning and to provide valuable insight into the public dataset. In addition, we delve into abuse channels to identify which widely-known platforms can be maliciously deployed by abusers following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Consequently, we demonstrate the polarization property of Bitcoin addresses practically utilized on transactions, and confirm the possible usage of public report data for providing clues to track cyber threats. We expect that this research on Bitcoin abuse can empirically reach victims more effectively than cybercrime, which is subject to professional investigation.
Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Twitter and Facebook have become a significant testing ground for Artificial Intelligence developers who build programs, known as socialbots, that imitate actual users by automating their social-network activities such as forming social links and posting content. Particularly, Twitter users have shown difficulties in distinguishing these socialbots from the human users in their social graphs. Frequently, legitimate users engage in conversations with socialbots. More impressively, socialbots are effective in acquiring human users as followers and exercising influence within them. While the success of socialbots is certainly a remarkable achievement for AI practitioners, their proliferation in the Twitter-sphere opens many possibilities for cybercrime. The proliferation of socialbots in the Twitter-sphere motivates us to assess the characteristics or strategies that make socialbots most likely to succeed. In this direction, we created 120 socialbot accounts in Twitter, which have a profile, follow other users, and generate tweets either by reposting messages that others have posted or by creating their own synthetic tweets. Then, we employ a 2 k factorial design experiment in order to quantify the infiltration effectiveness of different socialbot strategies. Our analysis is the first of a kind, and reveals what strategies make socialbots successful in the Twitter-sphere.
Internet of Things (IoT) is envisaged as a transformative approach that provides any service over the Internet by enabling communications through the interconnection of heterogeneous devices. The potential threats and possible attacks against IoT devices have grown drastically and the cybercrime statistics from the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) shows that South Africans lose in excess of R2.2 billion due to the security vulnerabilities annually. Unfortunately, the security requirements are not yet well addressed as it is still in its infant stage. Therefore, before there is a widespread adoption of IoT, there needs to be stringent security and reliability in the IoT space. The proposed research aims to close this gap through the implementation of a user-centric and automated IoT testbed in context with a setting that is close to the real-world South African environment to address the specific IoT vulnerabilities in the country. Because of the limited amount of work performed so far in this field of study, this research will not only contribute in filling the missing gap in the area of IoT security vulnerabilities, but will also contribute towards a better understanding of the subject matter and uptake of the IoT technology.
The metric space model of similarity has become a standard formal paradigm of generic similarity search engine implementations. However, the constraints of identity and symmetry prevent from expressing the subjectivity and dependence on the context perceived by humans. In this paper, we study the suitability of the Distance density model of similarity for searching. First, we use the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to estimate a data density in search collections and evaluate plenty of queries using the standard geometric model and its extension respecting the densities. We let 200 people assess the search effectiveness of the two alternatives using the web interface. Encouraged by the positive effects of the Distance density model, we propose an alternative way to estimate the data densities to avoid the quadratic LOF computation complexity with respect to the dataset size. The sketches with unbalanced bits are clarified to be in correlation with LOFs, which opens a possibility for an efficient implementation of large-scale similarity search systems based on the Distance density model.
Understanding the processes in education, such as the student learning behavior within a specific course, is a key to continuous course improvement. In online learning systems, students' learning can be tracked and examined based on data collected by the systems themselves. However, it is non-trivial to decide how to extract the desired students' behavior from the limited data in traditional classroom courses. Software development courses are a domain where student behavior analysis would be especially useful, as continuous teaching improvement in this fast progressing domain is necessary. In this paper, we propose to use process mining for improvement-motivated process analysis of a software development course (web development in particular). To this end, we analyze Git logs of students' projects to understand their development processes. Process mining has been chosen as it can help us to find a descriptive model of this process. The main contribution of this paper is the detailed methodology of process mining usage for students' project development analysis, considering various commit characteristics, which are crucial in understanding student coding-behavior patterns. The process mining analysis proved to be very useful, indicating multiple directions for the course improvement, which we also include in this work as a secondary contribution. The third contribution of this work is the summary and discussion of the process mining advantages and current gaps in process mining research for this task. The data we used are made publicly available to other researchers.
In this paper, we describe a system for the continuous collection of data for the needs of network security management. When a cybersecurity incident occurs in the network, the contextual information on the involved assets facilitates estimating the severity and impact of the incident and selecting an appropriate incident response. We propose a system based on the combination of active and passive network measurements and the correlation of the data with third-party systems. The system enumerates devices and services in the network and their vulnerabilities via fingerprinting of operating systems and applications. Further, the system pairs the hosts in the network with contacts on responsible administrators and highlights critical infrastructure and its dependencies. The system concentrates all the information required for common incident handling procedures and aims to speed up incident response, reduce the time spent on the manual investigation, and prevent errors caused by negligence or lack of information.
Motion capture technologies digitize human movements by tracking 3D positions of specific skeleton joints in time. Such spatio-temporal data have an enormous application potential in many fields, ranging from computer animation, through security and sports to medicine, but their computerized processing is a difficult problem. The recorded data can be imprecise, voluminous, and the same movement action can be performed by various subjects in a number of alternatives that can vary in speed, timing or a position in space. This requires employing completely different data-processing paradigms compared to the traditional domains such as attributes, text or images. The objective of this tutorial is to explain fundamental principles and technologies designed for similarity comparison, searching, subsequence matching, classification and action detection in the motion capture data. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of similarity needed to express the degree of accordance between pairs of motion sequences and also discuss the machine-learning approaches able to automatically acquire content-descriptive movement features. We explain how the concept of similarity together with the learned features can be employed for searching similar occurrences of interested actions within a long motion sequence. Assuming a user-provided categorization of example motions, we discuss techniques able to recognize types of specific movement actions and detect such kinds of actions within continuous motion sequences. Selected operations will be demonstrated by on-line web applications.
"Mining opinion on social media microblogs presents opportunities to extract meaningful insight from the public from trending issues like the yahoo-yahoo which in Nigeria, is synonymous to cybercrime. In this study, content analysis of selected historical tweets from yahoo-yahoo hashtag was conducted for sentiment and topic modelling. A corpus of 5500 tweets was obtained and pre-processed using a pre-trained tweet tokenizer while Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), Liu Hu method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) graphs were used for sentiment analysis, topic modelling and topic visualization. Results showed the corpus had 173 unique tweet clusters, 5327 duplicates tweets and a frequency of 9555 for yahoo. Further validation using the mean sentiment scores of ten volunteers returned R and R2 of 0.8038 and 0.6402; 0.5994 and 0.3463; 0.5999 and 0.3586 for Human and VADER; Human and Liu Hu; Liu Hu and VADER sentiment scores, respectively. While VADER outperforms Liu Hu in sentiment analysis, LDA and LSI returned similar results in the topic modelling. The study confirms VADER's performance on unstructured social media data containing non-English slangs, conjunctions, emoticons, etc. and proved that emojis are more representative of sentiments in tweets than the texts."
"Only recently have scholars of criminology begun to examine a wider spectrum of the effects of digital technologies beyond 'cybercrime' to include human rights, privacy, data extractivism and surveillance. Such accounts, however, remain anthropocentric and capitalocentric. They do not fully consider the environmental impacts caused by the manufacture, consumption, use and disposal of digital technologies under conditions of ecologically unequal exchange. The worst impacts of extractivism and pollution are borne by societies and ecosystems in the world's economic periphery and contribute to an acceleration of planetary ecocide. Three examples illustrate our argument: (1) deep-sea mining of metals and minerals; (2) the planned obsolescence of digital devices while limiting the right to repair; and (3) the disposal of e-waste. Acknowledging the urgent need to reorient the trajectory of technology innovation towards more-than-human futures, we advance some ideas from the field of design research-that is, the field of scholarly inquiry into design practices-on how to decouple technological progress from neoliberal economic growth. We venture outside criminology and offer a glimpse into how design researchers have recently begun a similar reflective engagement with post-anthropocentric critiques, which can inspire new directions for research across digital and green criminology."
At recent time, cybercrime has increased significantly in the world and also in Bangladesh due to consequence of massive digitalization efforts in every sector. These types of offense require systematic probing in order to be revealed properly at the court of law. This research work proposed a comprehensive digital forensics framework to facilitate forensically ready common standard digital forensics to the investigators. The framework recommended proactive and reactive forensics to enable live and post forensics issues. The purpose of the proposed framework is to allow systematic postmortem of digital forensics. Moreover, it allows further investigations suggested during examination or analysis phase. An expert system is introduced into the framework to improve efficiency through inference engine. This assistive system included digital forensics case database as a history keeper to store all documentations and results of the accomplished forensics examination. The inference engine is expected to generate a priority list from the historical data by a proposed algorithm. In addition, the expert system is expected to guide examiners during forensics. Furthermore, dissemination of forensics outcomes anticipated automatically to the authorized investigators by this system. However, the proposed framework is based on theoretical approach which is expected to be evaluated and implemented using assistive expert system in the future.
In recent years, understanding the people behind cybercrime from a hacker-centric perspective has drawn increased attention. Preliminary exploration in online hacker social dynamics has found that hackers extensively exchange information with others in online communities, including vulnerabilities, stolen data, etc. However, there is a lack of research that explores automated identification and characterization of expert hackers within online communities. In this research, we identify expert hackers and characterize their specialties by devising a scalable and generalizable framework leveraging two categories of features to analyze hacker forum content. The framework encompasses text analytics for key hacker identification and analysis. In the Text Analytics module, we employ an interaction coherence analysis (ICA) framework, to extract interactions among the users in hacker communities as topological feature. In Expert Identification & Analysis, we characterize each hacker with content features extracted with lexicon matching and structural features from the ICA component. Results reveal an interaction network and content-based clustering of key actors within the studied hacker community. Our project contributes to both social media analytics and cybersecurity research as we provide a complete analytical framework to analyze the key hackers from both an interaction network perspective and discussion content perspective. This framework can benefit cybersecurity researchers and practitioners by offering an inclusive angle for analyzing hacker social dynamics.
Incident handling, a fundamental activity of a cybersecurity incident response team, is a complex discipline that consumes a significant amount of personnel's time and costs. There are continuous efforts to facilitate incident handling and response in terms of providing procedural or decision support and processing relevant data. In this paper, we survey the approaches towards (semi-)automated incident handling and response backed by recommender systems that are successful in other domains. We discuss which phases and tiers of incident handling can be automated and to what level while evaluating the maturity of proposed approaches and tools. While we did not find a full-scale recommender system that would guide the user through incident handling and suggest which steps to take, many of them aim at particular problems. The discussed issues are not resolved yet but seem to get the attention of researchers and will likely be investigated in the future.
The current study provides an empirical testing of the victim-offender overlap in online platforms due to the scarcity of studies examining this overlapping victim-offending dynamic. Two types of cyber-interpersonal violence are examined: Cyber-harassment (including cyber-sexual harassment) and cyber-impersonation. Using Choi's (2008) integrated theory of Cyber-Routine Activities Theory, a sample of 272 college students at a Massachusetts university are examined. Three major findings are revealed: (1) Respondents who engage in risky online leisure activities are more likely to experience interpersonal violence in cyberspace, (2) poor online security management can contribute to the likelihood of being victimized by interpersonal violence on social networking sites (SNS), and (3) respondents who engage in risky social networking site activities are likely to commit cyber-interpersonal violence. For the two types of cyber-interpersonal violence examined in this study, it could also be predicted that females are more likely to have higher levels of victimization. Cybersecurity management and sex had no significant effects on cyber-interpersonal violence offending. The hope is that education on the potential hazards of the Internet and of cyber-interpersonal violence will induce more responsible online activity and engagement. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
"Law develops along with technological developments; hence both cannot be separated. In the current era, technology is developing very fast and often humans need to be protected from its uncontrollable use. This is where the law emerges to provide oversight and protection against violations created by technology. One of such technologies that violate legislation is deep fake technology. It is widely used in the creative industry which is fast emerging in Indonesia, and is closely related to the use of copyrights, which are facing a great threat from deepfake in the form of copyright violations. This study used normative juridical research methods to examine criminal acts in deepfakes. Several laws and legal studies were analyzed to identify factors regarding violations that occur when using deepfake technology in cyberspace. It was evident in the findings that deepfake is responsible for violation of the intellectual property rights, mainly the copyrights of the creator of works of art, and thus categorized as cybercrimes. The study treated deepfake as intellectual property violations, and also a cybercrime as there was the use of internet and computer technology and artificial intelligence to commit these crimes. The study implies that intellectual property rights are also like moral rights and economic rights."
"Mainstream media tend to frame media content from the perspectives of locals and seldom in the interest of diasporic communities. However, the emergence of social media has supported the existence of online diasporic communities. Deploying insights from the concepts of alternative media, digital counter public sphere and hidden transcript, this study explores the use of Facebook groups by Zimbabwean diaspora to form transnational online communities and connect with the homeland. This is a netnographic study of selected Facebook groups of Zimbabweans residing abroad. The study shows that since mainstream media in both home and host countries tend to exclude and marginalise interests of diasporic communities, Facebook has become an alternative counter public sphere for diasporic communities. Due to the affordances of social media, networking sites can be expedient platforms for creating diasporic networks, facilitating information circulation and enabling unrestricted and wide-ranging public debate; however, they can be volatile and susceptible to cybercrime and cyberbullying. The study demonstrates conundrums of online-based communities with regard to issues of trust, legitimacy, accountability and regulation.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is permeating our daily lives, blurring the boundaries between the cyber world and the physical world. With an increased number of identified sources, obtaining potential digital evidence has become a significant aspect of investigations and incident responses. However, multi-level interconnections are bringing new challenges to identifying connected things in IoT ecosystems. This study focuses on IoT services that can connect or be connected to various things to reveal their connected relationship by examining forensic artifacts under six interconnected scenarios. We found that not all services retain traces of interconnection. Based on our findings from scenario-based experiments and existing IoT forensic frameworks, we propose an improved IoT forensic model to identify interconnectivity between things. This framework suggests additional phases for identifying the interconnectivity of things. The proposed framework is designed to investigate IoT-related cases by identifying all the connected things, ensuring relevant data collection, narrowing down areas of investigation, and integrating the data. Our proposed model discovers pieces of connected things, which helps reveal the whole interconnected IoT ecosystems where users are involved in. This approach can also be applied for a thorough understanding of events relating to things and services around a suspect in cybercrime response.
In the Republic of Croatia, electronic signature is subject to the regulation of a statute which regulate the implementation of European legislation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. The goal of the paper is to identify and estimate the new EU legislative framework for electronic identification and a new system of regulation and supervision for electronic service providers in the EU, which should stimulate electronic commerce and cross-border digital public services. This regulation places particular emphasis on the recognition of electronic identification means between Member States for cross-border authentication, personal data security and the supervision of qualified providers of trust services. Using the normative and institutional analysis of national legal source, as research method in the paper, has helped to identify the typical problems that arise in regulating electronic signature. We find that the results imply that, despite the optimism that using electronic signatures can have a significant impact on e-finance, cybercrime is a growing threat. Commercial operators only become aware that the electronic signature methods they use must be adequate and that certain criminals can even,break the two-degree authentication process. Professional users and consumers needs continuous education to keep pace with the fraudsters.
In a globally interconnected cyber space, an appropriate level of information security (IS) is one of the business requirements for the successful operation of business systems, particularly in the fields of high-tech and finance. These two fields are also the most exposed to abuse and different types of cybercrime. The development of information security policies (ISP) is one of the basic measures for providing adequate levels of IS. These must be appropriately promoted within organisations, which ought to provide relevant training courses for employees in order to raise their awareness and make them understand that they are contributing to safe and secure working processes and thus to the general success of the organisation by complying with prescribed procedures and implementing prescribed working methods consistently. The present research study, which focuses on IS and employees' compliance with ISP, aims to determine the state-of-affairs with respect to IS in Slovene insurance undertakings, the types of in-house actions that are or could be implemented to improve the aforementioned issues, the types of measures that are used to decrease the long-term costs of insurance undertakings' operations. It presents analysed data in the field of insurance, measures for improving the level of IS with the best cost-benefit ratio and individual improvements.
Many criminals exploit the convenience of anonymity in the cyber world to conduct illegal activities. E-mail is the most commonly used medium for such activities. Extracting knowledge and information from e-mail text has become an important step for cybercrime investigation and evidence collection. Yet, it is one of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks due to special characteristics of e-mail dataset. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mining the writing styles from a collection of e-mails written by multiple anonymous authors. The general idea is to first cluster the anonymous e-mail by the stylometric features and then extract the writeprint, i.e., the unique writing style, from each cluster. We emphasize that the presented problem together with our proposed solution is different from the traditional problem of authorship identification, which assumes training data is available for building a classifier. Our proposed method is particularly useful in the initial stage of investigation, in which the investigator usually have very little information of the case and the true authors of suspicious e-mail collection. Experiments on a real-life dataset suggest that clustering by writing style is a promising approach for grouping e-mails written by the same author. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Recently, hackers intend to reproduce malicious links utilizing several ways to mislead users. They try to control victims' machines or get their data remotely by gaining access to private information they use via cyberspace. QR codes are twodimensional barcodes with the capacity to encode various data types and can be viewed by digital devices, such as smartphones. However, there is no approved protocol in QR code generation; therefore, QR codes might be exposed to several questionable attacks. QR code attacks might be perpetrated using barcodes, and there are some security countermeasures. Some of these solutions are restricted to malicious link detection techniques with knowledge of cryptographic methods. Therefore, this study aims to detect malicious links embedded in 1D (linear) and 2D (QR) codes. A cybercrime attack was proposed based on barcode counterfeiting that can be used to perform online attacks. A dataset of 100000 malicious and benign URLs was created via several resources, and their lexical features were obtained. Analyses were conducted to illustrate how different features and users deal with online barcode content. Several artificial intelligence models were implemented. A decision tree classifier was identified as the most suitable model for identifying malicious URLs. Our outcomes suggested that a secure artificial intelligence barcode scanner (BarAI) is recommended to detect malicious barcode links with an accuracy of 90.243%."
Crisis and disruption are often unpredictable and can create opportunities for crime. During such times, policing may also need to meet additional challenges to handle the disruption. The use of social media by officials can be essential for crisis mitigation and crime reduction. In this paper, we study the use of Twitter for crime mitigation and reduction by UK police (and associated) agencies in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that whilst most of the tweets from our sample concerned issues that were not specifically about crime, especially during the first stages of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in tweets about fraud, cybercrime and domestic abuse. There was also an increase in retweeting activity as opposed to the creation of original messages. Moreover, in terms of the impact of tweets, as measured by the rate at which they are retweeted, followers were more likely to 'spread the word' when the tweet was content-rich (discussed a crime specific matter and contained media), and account holders were themselves more active on Twitter. Considering the changing world we live in, criminal opportunity is likely to evolve. To help mitigate this, policy makers and researchers should consider more systematic approaches to developing social media communication strategies for the purpose of crime mitigation and reduction during disruption and change more generally. We suggest a framework for so doing.
Information systems accelerate the advancement of society. However, malicious manipulation of information would bring great harm. Recently, criminal groups are increasingly involved in cybercrime, especially in the Local Area Network (LAN). Several methods are being used to analyze network traffic in LAN such as extracting the transition patterns in traffic flows, however, research on visualization of network traffic, thus detecting and classifying various abnormal events, is insufficient. In this research, we propose visual analytics for generating feature maps of network events based on protocol information. We extract protocol information of ARP, TCP, and UDP from network traffic and generate each type of feature maps. Then for each event, we merge these three types into one image by putting them into different channels, to represent features. We simulate and visualize eight types of network events in LAN which are the normal, arp scan, tcp scan, scan of tcp port 23, scan of tcp port 80, udp scan, scan of udp port 137 and scan of udp port 1900. Then for this multiclass classification problem, we adopt a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between these network events, with these eight types as labels and generated feature maps as inputs. We evaluated the scheme using precision, recall, and F-measure in two LANs, at last, achieving an average F-measure of 0.76.
File type identification (FTI) has become a major discipline for anti-virus developers, firewall designers and for forensic cybercrime investigators. Over the past few years, research has seen the introduction of several classifiers and features. One of these advances is the so-called n-grams analysis, which is an interpretation of statistical counting in classified fragments. Recently, n-grams based approaches were already successfully combined with computational intelligence classifiers. However, the academic body of literature is scant when it comes to a comprehensive explanation of machine learning based approaches such as neural networks (NN) or support vector machines (SVM). For example, how the input parameters, including learning rate, different values of n for n-grams, etc. influence the results. In addition, very few studies have compared the scalability of NN vs. SVM approaches. Therefore, a systematic research in comparing different approaches is needed to address these questions. Hence, this paper investigates this type of comparison, by focusing on the n-gram analysis as a feature for the two different classifiers: SVMs and NNs. This paper details our experiments with two NNs and four SVMs, using linear kernels and RBF kernels on RealDC datasets. In general, we found that SVM-based approaches performed better than the NN, but their scalability is still a challenge. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Research has shown that psychosocial and behavioral factors are associated with engagement in a range of deviant behaviors across offline settings. To date, however, very little research has explored the impact of these factors in online contexts. This article addresses this gap by examining the psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with common types of adolescent cyberdeviance. This is accomplished through an empirical study of 327 adolescents enrolled in a high school located in a large Australian city. The study assesses various aspects of psychosocial and behavioral functioning using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (total difficulties, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, prosocial behavior), as well as numerous types of cyberdeviance relevant to young people, including cyberfraud, cyberhate, cyberviolence, sexting, digital piracy, hacking, and cyberbullying. A series of multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to demonstrate the association between psychosocial and behavioral difficulties and various types of cyberdeviance, independent of gender, school grade, socioeconomic status, and engagement in offline delinquency. Results indicate that total difficulties, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems were significantly associated with greater likelihood of engagement in most types of cyberdeviance examined in this study, whereas prosocial behavior was associated with a lower likelihood of engagement in digital piracy only. A discussion of the findings highlights the importance of understanding these factors in a digital context, as well as demonstrating the need to account for them when designing targeted interventions.
Despite the recent proliferation of legal online gambling in the Unites States, offshore gambling sites still remain prevalent, causing various problems in the U.S. Although numerous law violations occur in this domain, prior research has reported limited information about offshore gambling, mostly focusing on offshore gamblers' characteristics and motivations. Using routine activities theory, this study attempted to understand environmental and theoretical factors that affect the use of offshore sites by focusing on offshore gambling-generating contexts that involve offshore sites and online casino reviews. Major findings show that the online visibility of offshore sites may be a key predictor of the use of the sites by U.S. players. In addition, online casino reviews providing a blacklist of online gambling sites served as informal guardians, helping players avoid unreliable offshore gambling sites that pose a risk to their customers. Policy implications were suggested based on the findings and provided insights toward effective online gambling regulatory efforts.
Cybercriminals have been using the Internet to accomplish illegitimate activities and to execute catastrophic attacks. Computer-Mediated Communication such as online chat provides an anonymous channel for predators to exploit victims. In order to prosecute criminals in a court of law, an investigator often needs to extract evidence from a large volume of chat messages. Most of the existing search tools are keyword-based, and the search terms are provided by an investigator. The quality of the retrieved results depends on the search terms provided. Due to the large volume of chat messages and the large number of participants in public chat rooms, the process is often time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents a topic search model to analyze archives of chat logs for segregating crime-relevant logs from others. Specifically, we propose an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based model to extract topics, compute the contribution of authors in these topics, and study the transitions of these topics over time. In addition, we present a special model for characterizing authors-topics over time. This is crucial for investigation because it provides a view of the activity in which authors are involved in certain topics. Experiments on two real-life datasets suggest that the proposed approach can discover hidden criminal topics and the distribution of authors to these topics.
"A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cybercrime that renders a target service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from several sources (attack nodes). In this paper, we focus on DDoS attacks on a computer network by spreading bots throughout the network. A mathematical differential equation model is proposed to represent the dynamism of nodes at different compartments of the model. The model considers two levels of security, with the assumption that the recovered nodes do not return to the same security level. In previous models, the recovered nodes are returned to be suspect on the same security level, which is an unrealistic assumption. Moreover, it is assumed that the attacker can use the infected target nodes to attack again. With such epidemic-like assumptions of infection, different cases are presented and discussed, and the stability of the model is analyzed as well; reversing the symmetry transformation of attacking nodes population is also proven. The proposed model has many parameters in order to precisely describe the infection movement and propagation. Numerical simulation methods are used to solve the developed system of equations using MATLAB, with the intention of finding the best counteraction to control DDoS spread throughout a network."
Technological progress leads to the transformation of social environment, generating a digital society that exists in the context of new opportunities and new threats. The article is devoted to the problem of expansion of radical political ideas among the most active in the Internet space audience of young people (18-30 years). It is considered the features of digital communication channels, the main advantages of the Internet as a space of freedom, characteristics of the political behavior of young people in digital society. Considering the new technological conditions, as well as the peculiarities of the perception of information by the youth audience, we can talk about favorable conditions for the expansion of radical political ideas among the most active users of the digital reality. The main threats today are cybercrime, illegal trafficking in drugs and weapons, as well as the deliberate reduction of the authority of authorities at different levels, the promotion of terrorism. So, namely the youth audience is the most important target group exposed to the information impact during the hybrid wars, which is a new type of conflicts, characterized the digital epoch. It is proposed the measures to counter the expansion of radical political ideas among young people.
One of the pressing issues in cyber crime is to carry out efficient investigation in child pornography cases. The work in this paper presents an in-depth understanding and deployment of statistical analysis methodologies in the field of digital forensic, with the linkage of the MD5 hash value in conducting forensic investigations. More precisely, it highlights the challenges that forensic investigators are facing during an examination, such as the amount or the content of data. Furthermore, the paper presents the margins of forensic software when dealing with large quantities of data, and how the use of statistical analysis assists in reducing the investigation time and improving effectiveness and efficiency.
The network flow monitoring has evolved to collect information beyond the network and transport layers, most importantly the application layer information. This information is used to improve network security and performance by enabling more precise performance analysis and intrusion detection. In this paper, we contribute to this effort by extending flow monitoring with information from the SSH protocol. Firstly, we analyze the SSH protocol to determine which information can be obtained from the connection establishment phase. Based on the analysis, we create an extension to our flow monitoring infrastructure that allows obtaining the selected information. Lastly, we analyze the SSH connections observed in the university campus network and discuss the benefits of performing the detailed SSH protocol analysis. We argue that with a precise recognition of login attempt results it is possible to improve the detection of successful bruteforce password attacks. Moreover, we publish an anonymized version of our dataset including the SSH specific information.
Secure multi-party computation (SMC) allows multiple parties to jointly and securely compute a function while preserving the privacy of the involved parties. In this regard, homomorphic cryptosystems allow users to perform addition or multiplication operations on encrypted values without having to decrypt the input values. In this paper, we propose both a cryptographic and a non-cryptographic privacy-preserving protocols that allow one party to collaboratively compute a private polynomial function with at least two other parties using semantically secure cryptosystems. In this respect, the function to be evaluated is kept private to the party in question. In addition, we assume that there is no fully trusted party and that all parties are semi-honest. Moreover, we assume that there is no collusion between the different parties. We present the two protocols in question and report on the underlying performance through the presentation of our implementation results. The proposed protocols are relevant in many applications such as evidence sharing in multi-party forensic investigations, situation awareness through the secure sharing in distributed monitoring of plan execution, etc.
Several critical infrastructures are integrating information technology into their operations, and as a result, the cyber attack surface extends over a broad range of these infrastructures. Cyber attacks have been a serious problem for industries since the early 2000s, causing significant interruptions to their ability to produce goods or offer services to their clients. The thriving cybercrime economy encompasses money laundering, black markets, and attacks on cyber-physical systems that result in service disruptions. Furthermore, extensive data breaches have compromised the personally identifiable information of millions of people. This paper aims to summarize some of the major cyber attacks that have occurred in the past 20 years against critical infrastructures. These data are gathered in order to analyze the types of cyber attacks, their consequences, vulnerabilities, as well as the victims and attackers. Cybersecurity standards and tools are tabulated in this paper in order to address this issue. This paper also provides an estimate of the number of major cyber attacks that will occur on critical infrastructure in the future. This estimate predicts a significant increase in such incidents worldwide over the next five years. Based on the study's findings, it is estimated that over the next 5 years, 1100 major cyber attacks will occur on critical infrastructures worldwide, each causing more than USD 1 million in damages.
Although spam email messages have been the primary source of cybercrime since the early Internet era, there is no quick fix to this problem. Governments have established anti-spam legislation, but surprisingly, there has been no measurement of policy impact. This study aims to fill the gap by utilizing a quasi-experimental setting in South Korea, where the anti-spam policy was substantially amended in November 2014. A significant change was in the default setting, switching from an opt-out to an opt-in scheme, which required that commercial email senders obtain recipients' prior consent. Also, the law notably escalated the deterrent penalties for perpetrators. To empirically examine the policy effectiveness, we use a large-scale data set of 5.61 billion spam emails originating from over 38,000 spammers in 226 countries during twenty months in 2014-2015. Our findings suggest that the amended policy adopting the opt-in scheme decreased the volume of spam originating from Korea by 16.1%. The expected economic gain from the increased productivity of recipients is 7.649 million USD per year. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting that a well-designed policy can lower cybersecurity incidents that threaten organizations, operations, and individuals. Our finding also provides important implications for policymakers and managers in designing effective policies with data-driven evidence.
"National security policies increasingly threaten the rules that govern trade and investment flows. This problem is deeper and far more intractable than recent high-profile controversies, such as disputes over the Trump Administration's steel and aluminum tariffs, suggest. Governments worldwide have adopted national security policies that address an increasingly wide array of risks and vulnerabilities, including climate change; pandemic disease; cybercrime; terrorism; and threats to infrastructure, industry, and the media. These policies are also increasingly likely to conflict with trade and investment rules. In other words, while today's high-profile controversies center on alleged abuses of national security in economic law, it is the potential for good-faith but novel national security claims that poses a more significant and permanent threat to the system. This Article is the first to map the new national security challenge and consider its implications for reforming the economic order. It demonstrates that the twenty-first-century expansion of national security policy undermines existing models for separating security measures from ordinary economic regulation. What is needed, it argues, is a new model for reintegrating the economic order with the national security state. To that end, this Article identifies reforms that allow for some oversight of increasingly novel national security claims while preserving flexibility for governments to redefine their security policies in response to twenty-first-century threats."
Domain names play a critical role in cybercrime, because they identify hosts that serve malicious content (such as malware, Trojan binaries, or malicious scripts), operate as command-and-control servers, or carry out some other role in the malicious network infrastructure. To defend against Internet attacks and scams, operators widely use blacklisting to detect and block malicious domain names and IP addresses. Existing blacklists are typically generated by crawling suspicious domains, manually or automatically analyzing malware, and collecting information from honeypots and intrusion detection systems. Unfortunately, such blacklists are difficult to maintain and are often slow to respond to new attacks. Security experts set up and join mailing lists to discuss and share intelligence information, which provides a better chance to identify emerging malicious activities. In this paper, we design GOSSIP, a novel approach to automatically detect malicious domains based on the analysis of discussions in technical mailing lists (particularly on security-related topics) by using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. We identify a set of effective features extracted from email threads, users participating in the discussions, and content keywords, to infer malicious domains from mailing lists, without the need to actually crawl the suspect websites. Our result shows that GOSSIP achieves high detection accuracy. Moreover, the detection from our system is often days or weeks earlier than existing public blacklists.
This paper uses a survey of social networking users to empirically explore their perceptions of security notices - independently verified artefacts informing internet site users that security measures are taken by the site owner. We investigate such factors as purchase experience, purchase intention, risk propensity, usage of various social network categories and user victimisation. The results suggest a strong positive link between purchase intention and paying attention to security notices/features on social networks. We find that higher use of narrow-purpose social networking services has a negative association with paying attention to security notices. We also show that users with higher risk propensity pay less attention to security notices/features. Finally, we find no association between purchase experience, user victimisation and perception of security notices/features. Our results provide new, and possibly more refined, evidence of the factors that influence the attention paid to security notices/features by social media users. The results have important implications for theory development, policy and practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Cloud storage services allow users to store their data online and remotely access, maintain, manage, and back up their data from anywhere through the Internet. Although this storage is helpful, it challenges digital forensic investigators and practitioners in collecting, identifying, acquiring, and preserving evidential data. This research proposes an investigation scheme for analyzing data remnants and determining probative artefacts in a cloud environment. Using the Box cloud as a case study, we collect the data remnants available on end-user device storage following the accessing, uploading, and storing of data in the cloud storage. The data remnants are collected from several sources, such as client software files, Prefetch, directory listings, registries, browsers, network PCAP, and memory and link files. Results indicate that the collected data remnants are helpful in determining a sufficient number of artefacts about investigated cybercrimes.
Cybersecurity is now more important than ever, and so is education in this field. However, the cybersecurity domain encompasses an extensive set of concepts, which can be taught in different ways and contexts. To understand the state of the art of cybersecurity education and related research, we examine papers from the ACM SIGCSE and ACM ITiCSE conferences. From 2010 to 2019, a total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors. We discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security), and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well. The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset. Our results provide orientation in the area, a synthesis of trends, and implications for further research. Therefore, they are relevant for instructors, researchers, and anyone new in the field of cybersecurity education. The information we collected and synthesized from individual papers are organized in a publicly available dataset.
"This is a comparative study to empirically investigate the performances of three different procedures for calculating authorship attribution likelihood ratios (LR). The procedures to be compared are: 1) a procedure based on multivariate kernel density (MVKD) with lexical features; 2) a procedure based on word N-grams; and 3) a procedure based on character N-grams. Furthermore, the best-performing LRs of these three procedures are fused into combined single LRs using a logistic-regression fusion, in order to investigate the extent of the improvement/deterioration that the fusion brings about. This study uses chatlog messages, which were presented as evidence to prosecute paedophiles, for testing. The numbers of word tokens used to model the authorship attribution of each message group are 500 and 1000 words. This was done to examine the effect of sample size on the performance of a system. The performance of a system is assessed with regard to its validity (= accuracy) and reliability (= precision) using the log-likelihood-ratio cost (C-llr) and 95% credible intervals (CI), respectively. While describing the different characteristics of these three procedures in their outcomes, this study demonstrates that the MVKD procedure was the best-performing procedure out of the three in terms of C-llr. This study also demonstrates that a logistic-regression fusion is useful for combining the LRs obtained from the three procedures in question, resulting in a good improvement in performance."
An increasing number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use the Internet to support and grow businesses. The application of new technologies comes with inherent risks of ever-changing cyberspace and increasing cybercrime. Previous research has shown that the human factor remains the core element in the cybersecurity chain. Therefore, it is paramount that employees receive effective training to acquire a security mindset. This study puts forward previous research that resulted in a portable escape room game to raise cybersecurity awareness. The purpose of the study is to elaborate the transformation of the physical game into a virtual learning experience to increase flexibility in times such as the Covid-19 lockdown. As main method, we applied the design science framework of Hevner et al. As main result, the research elaborates the design of the developed artifact-a virtual prototype of the escape room game addressing the cybersecurity challenges of SMEs. For the evaluation of the prototype, empirical data was collected in qualitative and quantitative form. As main conclusions, we have observed that a physical escape room can be transformed into a virtual setting with little means without sacrificing player immersion. A limitation was identified in teaching targeted social engineering attacks.
The development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication technology is expected to provide super high-speed data transmission, and advanced network performance than the current fifth-generation (5G) and be fully functional by the 2030s. This development will have a significant impact and add improvements to digital extended reality (XR), autonomous systems, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), artificial intelligence (AI), underwater communications, blockchain technology, pervasive biomedical informatics and smart cities built on the digital infrastructure backbone of the Internet of Things (IoT). The ubiquitous nature of this large-scale 6G-enabled IoT that offers faster connectivity capabilities and integrates both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks will not only create new data security and privacy issues but also provide a treasure trove of digital evidence useful for digital forensic examiners investigating security incidents and cybercrime. However, for digital forensic examiners, evidence collection, preservation and analysis will become a priority in the successful deployment of 6G IoT networks. In this study, we define key applications of 6G network technology to the Internet of Things and its existing architectures. The survey introduces potential digital forensic challenges and related issues affecting digital forensic investigations specific to 6G IoT networks. Finally, we highlight and discuss forensic readiness and future research directions for identified challenges within the 6G IoT network environments.This article is categorized under:Digital and Multimedia Science > IoT Forensics
With the rapid advancement of technologies in the era of Industry 4.0, the inter-connected nature of operations and systems is introducing a rapidly changing landscape of digitized and connected systems. Cybercrime is considered as possibly the greatest threat to connected systems worldwide, and therefore there exists a large drive in engineering to include cybersecurity in the design, development and maintenance of smart cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, the cybersecurity space was considered the responsibility of Information Technology (IT) professionals, where the greater IT infrastructure was required to keep these engineering systems safe. However, through the evolution of engineering and control systems, the IT infrastructure has started to become more integrated with these systems, improving the efficiency of the systems, but also making them more susceptible to cyber-attacks. These changes mean that securing these systems cannot remain the sole responsibility of the IT professionals, as systems must be designed with cybersecurity in mind. Considering that engineers are designing and developing more integrated systems, there exists a knowledge gap in the field of cybersecurity engineering and engineers' understanding of their cybersecurity responsibilities. This study aimed to determine the level of security that is currently considered in standard electrical engineering projects in a typical academic environment. This baseline serves as a motivation to develop a practical approach to assist engineering students in considering cybersecurity when developing engineering systems and products.
Digital evidence continues to be an integral component in cybercrime investigative and judicial processes. However, increasing volume digital content and files makes it challenging for forensic examiners to process evidence in a timely way. In this paper, we use machine learning to predict stealthy watermarks in various file types. We use a black box approach which is different from current steganographic and cryptographic methods to find patterns of candidate file locations for hidden data. The results in this paper demonstrate that it is possible to use machine learning to build singleton models of the same file type as well as hybrid models to predict stealthy watermarks in files. In our experiments, the DOCX singleton models predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 40% to 100%. The PPTX singleton model predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 32.5% to 100%. Similarly, the JPEG singleton model predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 37.5% to 65%. We also generated four types of hybrid models: both HYBID3 and JPEG_PPTX models predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 47.5% to 92.5% while HYBRID_OOXML model predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 32.5% to 100%. In addition, JPEG_DOCX model predicted stealthy watermarks in files with predictive accuracies ranging from 47.5% to 90%.
"The article focuses on the main trends in the rapid development of digitization from ordinary consciousness of the society to the digital world, penetration of digitization elements in our everyday life. The author identifies main directions of the current development of digitization and society with the aim to secure its better regulation by criminal law. There have been four main trends distinguished: the identity trend; decentralized cooperation; data-based new economy, and physical-digital convergence. The research of the issue in question has identified a subjective build-up of digitization models that proves that the humankind on the whole and an individual, in particular, is responsible for actions undertaken by a robotic machine and an automated program. However, when building a horizontal model of control, an individual can withdraw from the process of making decisions but retain the right to receive benefits from such interaction. At the same time if such activity is based on the digital economy, there are some risks related to crime, including the ones related to the use of artificial intelligence by criminal groups."
Nowadays, Wireless Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) has become a valuable asset for transportation systems. However, this advanced technology is characterized by highly distributed and networked environment, which makes VANET communications vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks. Although Big Data Analytics has been used to solve this critical security issue by supporting the development of anti-jamming applications, as the amount of vehicular data is growing exponentially, the anti-jamming applications face many challenges (i., reactions in real-time) due to the lack of specific solutions that can keep up with the fast advancement of VANET. In this paper, we propose a new vehicular data prioritization model based on coresets to accelerate the Big Data Analytics in VANET. Our experimental evaluation shows that our solution can significantly increase the efficiency for clustering in jamming detection while keeping and improving the clustering quality. Also, the proposed solution can enable the real-time detection and be integrated to anti-jamming applications.
Investigating cybersecurity incidents requires in-depth knowledge from the analyst. Moreover, the whole process is demanding due to the vast data volumes that need to be analyzed. While various techniques exist nowadays to help with particular tasks of the analysis, the process as a whole still requires a lot of manual activities and expert skills. We propose an approach that allows the analysis of disk snapshots more efficiently and with lower demands on expert knowledge. Following a user-centered design methodology, we implemented an analytical tool to guide analysts during security incident investigations. The viability of the solution was validated by an evaluation conducted with members of different security teams.
Network segmentation is a powerful tool for network defense. In contemporary complex, dynamic, and multilayer networks, network segmentation suffers from lack of visibility into processes in the network, which results in less strict segment definition and loosen network security. Moreover, the dynamics of the networks makes the manual identification of network segments nearly impossible. In this paper, we inspect the possibilities of the behavioraware network segmentation using IP flows and machine learning approaches that would enable to identify segments automatically, even in a complex network. We evaluate the suitability of clustering algorithms for identification of behavior-consistent segments in a network. We show that the clustering algorithms can identify relevant behavior-consistent clusters that overlap with those identified manually by experts. Apart from the segment identification, we investigate the other essential task of network segmentation process: assignment of an unknown host to an existing segment. We evaluate the performance of four different classification mechanisms on a real-world dataset. We show that it is possible to assign an unknown host to an appropriate network segment with up to 92% precision. Moreover, we release the whole dataset and experiment steps available for public use.
Cybercrime reports showed an increase in the number of attacks targeting financial institutions. Indeed, banks were the target of 30% of the total number of cyber-attacks. One of the recommended methods for driving the security challenges is to implement an Information Security Governance Framework (ISGF), a comprehensive practice that starts from the top management and ends with the smallest function in a bank. Although such initiatives are effective, they typically take years to achieve and require loads of resources, especially for larger banks or if there are multiple ISGFs available for the bank to choose. These implementation challenges showed the necessity of having a method for evaluating the adequacy of an ISGF for a bank. The research performed during the preparation of this article did not reveal any available structured evaluation method for an ISGF before its implementation. This chapter introduces a novel method for scoring an ISGF to assess its adequacy for a bank without implementing it. The suggested approach is based on ISGF decomposition and transformation into a survey that will be answered by security experts. The survey results were loaded into a Deep Learning Algorithm that produced a scoring model that could predict the adequacy of an ISGF for a bank with an accuracy of 75%.
Cyberterrorism has become a hotly debated research issue in the past decades because of the convergence of mobile computing powers and the fledging multimedia communication computing capabilities. Cyberterrorism is the exploitation of computer network tools to incur malfunction or shut down critical infrastructures with several keyboard punches, which is dramatically different from traditional terrorism. Due to the ubiquitous multimedia communication tools, they have radically transformed the ways concerning data transmission. Unfortunately, it also incurs unprecedented opportunities for committing cyber crimes that we were not able to foresee two decades ago. Undoubtedly, the mushrooming proliferation of mobile phones spectacularly triggers the information security leakage while most people heavily rely on mobile phones for daily communication. As cybercrime or cyberterrorism surges, digital forensics (DF) of mobile communication devices still enormously lags behind than computer forensics. Hence, in this research paper, we provide a hypothetical case review concerning the DF of a potential cyberterrorist attack that was triggered by a mobile multimedia smart phone utilizing a popular web 2.0 application program via ubiquitous Wi-Fi access points. The corresponding DF of the mobile device was conducted in a step-by-step manner as well as the crime scene reconstruction based on the digital evidence collected, analyzed, and preserved.
"Web phishing is a form of cybercrime aimed at tricking people into visiting malicious URLs to exfiltrate sensitive data. Since the structure of a malicious URL evolves over time, phishing detection mechanisms that can adapt to such variations are paramount. Furthermore, web phishing detection is an unbalanced classification task, as legitimate URLs outnumber malicious ones in real-life cases. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising technique to minimize concept drift to enhance web phishing detection. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combines DL with reinforcement learning (RL); that is, a sequential decision-making paradigm in which the problem to be addressed is expressed as a Markov decision process (MDP). Recent studies have proposed an ad hoc MDP formulation to tackle unbalanced classification tasks called the imbalanced classification Markov decision process (ICMDP). In this paper, we exploit the ICMDP to present a double deep Q-Network (DDQN)-based classifier to address the unbalanced web phishing classification problem. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a Mendeley web phishing dataset, from which three different data imbalance scenarios are generated. Despite a significant training time, it results in better geometric mean, index of balanced accuracy, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve than other DL-based classifiers combined with data-level sampling techniques in all test cases."
Nowadays, the volume of the multimedia heterogeneous evidence presented for digital forensic analysis has significantly increased, thus requiring the application of big data technologies, cloud-based forensics services, as well as Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In digital forensics domain, ML algorithms have been applied for cybercrime investigation such as child abuse investigations, malware classification, and image forensics. This paper addresses this issues and deals with forensic analysis of digital images and videos. In particular, this work aims at proposing a multimedia classification tool with a parallel software architecture for a fast inspection, which is easy to use (to be used by officers during a search), requires limited hardware resources and it is built on an open-source software to limit its costs. Moreover, this tool must be able to quickly inspect multiple devices at a time. When positives are found in a device, such device will be seized for a deeper analysis later in the lab. It will not be seized otherwise, reducing the inconvenience for the suspect as well as the time required for the next analysis phase. As a case study, we focus on the identification of child pornography images. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is capable of guaranteeing a high recall, a fast process and high performances in real scenarios.
Phishing is one of the most frequently occurring forms of cybercrime that Internet users face and represents a violation of cybersecurity principles. Phishing is a fraudulent attack that is performed over the Internet with the purpose of obtaining and using without authorization the sensitive information of Internet users, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, and bank account information. Some widely used phishing attempts involve using email spoofing or instant messaging, aiming to convince a victim to visit the spoofed websites, which will result in obtaining the victim's information. In this work, we identify and analyze the most important features needed to detect the spoofed websites in virtue of two new feature selection techniques. The first proposed feature selection technique uses underlying feature selection methods that vote on each feature, and if such methods agree on a specific feature, that feature is selected. The second feature selection technique also uses underlying feature selection methods that vote on each feature, and if the majority vote on a specific feature, the feature is selected. We also propose a phishing detection technique based on both AdaBoost and LightGBM ensemble methods to detect the spoofed websites. The proposed method achieves a very high accuracy compared to that of the existing methods.
The increasing of cybercrime means an increase in the number of digital evidences produced in these criminal activities. Also, to pay attention to the security and integrity of digital data, the construction of digital evidence storage must pay attention to the need for convenience in adding storage and the need for investigators to avoid geographical problems in carrying out their duties. An ideal implementation of the problem is the development of network-based digital evidence storage using the Software-Defined Storage to build a clustered storage system. In this study, we build a clustered storage system using Ceph that will be functioned as digital evidence storage. Ceph is a Software-Defined Storage which is designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability. On the other hand, since digital evidence is fragile, then the security of storage system must also be considered so that the stored digital evidence in the storage system can be accepted in court. The security includes aspects of confidentiality, integrity and availability aspects. We were able to build a storage system using Ceph and as a result, our system storage has met the aforementioned scalability, confidentiality, integrity and availability aspects. The storage system is expected to contribute in terms of digital evidence storage and preservations.
Background: The proliferation of electronic banking has revolutionised the delivery of financial services across the globe. E-banking services offer substantial benefits, such as reduced costs to transact, convenience and flexibility. Despite the considerable penetration of e-banking in South Africa, it remains unclear whether customers are willing to continue using these services, particularly given the safety concerns, because of the high incidence of cybercrime. Objectives: Owing to the paucity of research on customers' attitude towards continued usage intentions of e-banking services, the aim of this study is to investigate the formation of attitude towards e-banking continued usage intentions among rural banking customers. Method: The study was underpinned by a positivist paradigm, and a descriptive design was employed. Primary data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires, which yielded 139 valid responses. Regression analysis was utilised during the analysis for hypothesis testing. Results: The results revealed that e-banking attitude is mainly driven by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, the results showed that e-banking attitude strongly predicts continued usage intentions. Conclusion: The empirical evidence presented in this study adds value to the existing research on e-banking, particularly in the context of rural banking customers, an area which is largely under-researched in South Africa.
While the internet and online social networks have positively enriched societal communications and economic opportunities, these technological advancements have changed-and continue to change-the very nature of crime, serving to breed a new sophisticated and technically capable criminal. Furthermore, the borderless nature of the phenomenon of cybercrime and the transnational dimensions of human trafficking, drugs importation and the illegal movement of firearms, cash and stolen goods means that criminals can plan their crimes from jurisdictions across the world, making law enforcement particularly challenging, the very reason why LEAs must maximise the potential of OSINT and seek new and innovative ways to prevent crime. Hence, it is essential for all practitioners, policy-makers and policing professionals to understand what OSINT is and what it is not, how it can be used and the limitations or conditions on it, as well as understanding more about the scale, scope and complexity of the threats from criminals whose methods of operating are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The purpose of this chapter is to explain the role and function of OSINT within the context of policing and existing intelligence collection disciplines, as well as to define OSINT from an LEA perspective and describe its position within the intelligence profession of policing.
Voice over IP (VoIP) technologies such as Skype are becoming increasingly popular and widely used in different organisations, and therefore identifying the usage of this service at the network level becomes very important. Reasons for this include applying Quality of Service (QoS), network planning, prohibiting its use in some networks and lawful interception of communications. Researchers have addressed VoIP traffic classification from different viewpoints, such as classifier accuracy, building time, classification time and online classification. This previous research tested their models using the same version of a VoIP product they used for training the model, giving generalizability only to that version of the product. This means that as new VoIP versions are released, these classifiers become obsolete. In this paper, we address if this approach is applicable to detecting new, untrained, versions of Skype. We suggest that using cost-sensitive classifiers can help to improve the accuracy of detecting untrained versions, by testing compared to other algorithms. Our experiment demonstrates promising preliminary results to detect Skype version 4, by building a cost sensitive classifier on Skype version 3, achieving an F-measure score of 0.57. This is a drastic improvement from not using cost sensitivity, which scores an F-measure of 0. This approach may be enhanced to improve the detection results and extended to improve detection for other applications that change protocols from version to version.
"The use of online review sites has grown significantly, allowing for communities to share information on products or services. These online review sites are marketed as being independent and trustworthy, but have been criticised for not ensuring the integrity of the reviews. One major concern is that of review fraud; where a person (such as a marketer) is paid to write favourable reviews for one product or poor reviews for a competitor. In this research we show a method for determining if two reviews share an author, which can be used to identify if a review is legitimate. Our results indicate a high quality of the method, with an f(1)-score of over 0.66 in testing data with 40 authors, with most authors having only one or two documents. This type of analysis can be used to investigate cases of potential hotel review fraud."
Background Crackdowns on urban sites with concentrated criminal activity are sometimes followed by geographical relocation of crime. Is this also the case in cyberspace, where illegal websites and online networks can be wiped clean, but also quickly rebuilt and replaced on new servers and URLs? Methods I address this question in three steps. First, I measure MDMA trade in a large digital market for drugs, before and after the arrest of a leading MDMA seller in the same market. Second, I count the number of available digital drug markets and vendor shops in the period February 2014 June 2018, to see if websites closed by police were replaced by new ones. Third, I track the digital movement and trading activities of individual drug sellers, before and after law enforcement shut down two large markets. Results After police arrested a leading MDMA seller, other MDMA sellers filled most - but not all - of the gap. A major law enforcement crackdown reduced the number of available markets, but new ones were created, and market counts eventually surpassed the previous peak. When law enforcement shut down two big markets, many of the sellers relocated to other e-commerce sites and continued high-earning operations there. Conclusion Arrests and market closures redirect digital drug trade to other sellers and markets. Hot spot policing in cyberspace might produce temporary results, but is arguably ineffective in the long run, as actors use information and communication technology's unique capacities to reorganize.
Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly permeating peoples' lives, gradually revolutionizing our way of life. Due to the tight connection between people and IoT, now civil and criminal investigations or internal probes must take IoT into account. From the forensic perspective, the IoT environment contains a rich set of artifacts that could benefit investigations, while the forensic investigation in IoT paradigm may have to alter to accommodate characteristics of IoT. Therefore, in this article, we analyze the impact of IoT on digital forensics and systematize the research efforts made by previous researchers from 2010 to 2018. We sketch the landscape of IoT forensics and examine the state of IoT forensics under a 3-D framework. The 3-D framework consists of a temporal dimension, a spatial dimension, and a technical dimension. The temporal dimension walks through the standard digital forensic process while the spatial dimension explores where to identify sources of evidence in IoT environment. These two dimensions attempt to provide principles and guidelines for standardizing digital investigations in the context of IoT. The technical dimension guides a way to the exploration of tools and techniques to ensure the enforcement of digital forensics in the ever-evolving IoT environment. Put together, we present a holistic overview of digital forensics in IoT. We also highlight open issues and outline promising suggestions to inspire future study.
"There is a widespread perception that computer crime sentencing is too harsh. But this criticism has occurred in the absence of comprehensive, multi-year data on how computer crimes are actually sentenced and how those sentences compare to other, purportedly similar crimes, such as trespass, burglary, or fraud. This article uses an analysis of real-world sentencing data to examine how the computer crimes are actually sentenced. We combined court filings and U.S. Sentencing Commission data files to build a custom data set of 1095 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) sentences from 2005 through 1998. Our results show that CFAA sentences are sentenced differently from trespass, burglary, or non-CFAA fraud crimes; that sentences in which the defendant exceeded authorized access have declined over the years; and that the sophisticated means and special skills enhancements have been less routinely applied than has been assumed. These results have policy implications for how CFAA crimes are sentenced."
Cybersecurity encompasses a broad range of practices, tools and concepts related closely to those of information and operational technology (OT) security. Cybersecurity is distinctive in its inclusion of the offensive use of information technology to attack adversaries. Use of the term cybersecurity as a key challenge and a synonym for information security or IT security confuses customers and security practitioners, and obscures critical differences between these disciplines. Recommendation for security leaders is that they should use the term cybersecurity to designate only security practices related to the defensive actions involving or relying upon information technology and/or OT environments and systems. Within this paper, we are aiming to explain cybersecurity and describe the relationships among cybersecurity, information security, OT security, IT security, and other related disciplines and practices, e. g. cyber defence, related to their implementation aligned with the planned or existing cybersecurity strategy at the national level. In the case study given example of The National Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Croatia and Action plan is presented and elaborated. The Strategy's primary objective is to recognize organizational problems in its implementation and broaden the understanding of the importance of this issue in the society.
Cyberattacks are on the increase in severity, complexity and frequency, negatively affecting the citizens, government, and businesses. Adversely, the security and Defence role-players in developing countries, such as South Africa, are short of the required capacity and capability to adequately defend and protect the national cyberspace against these fast moving and persistent threats and attacks. Be that as it may, the South African cyberspace still requires national attention and protection by the mandated role-players, such as the Defence force and its industry partners. Thus, within the cyber domain, the various Defence force role-players can no longer rely on traditional solutions to detect, defend, and respond to the forever changing cyber threats and cyberattacks. In order to reduce cybersecurity risks and strengthen cyber resilience of the nation, strategic cybersecurity information sharing in the Defence environment is becoming a necessity. Thus, the contribution from this paper is a systematic discussion and demonstration of a conceptual cyber threat intelligence sharing model and platform that could stimulate and enable different stakeholders within the Defence environment to seamlessly and collaboratively aggregate, analyse, and timely share contextual and actionable cyber-threat intelligence that could lead to a resilient cybersecurity posture and better protection of the national cyberspace.
Smart Grids play an important role in modern society and for the sustainability of its wellbeing. However, the undoubted advantages come at the cost of higher complexity, especially at the level of information and communication technologies that enhance the physical grid infrastructure. As such, software quality requirements, such as reliability, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and performance assume a more functional facet. In this paper, we focus on software reliability as one of the key qualities of a Smart Grid infrastructure, which is however not yet well defined and understood. We formulate relevant definitions of software reliability in the Smart Grid context, categorize information necessary to quantify the identified reliability views, and explore existing literature and online resources to assess what datasets, necessary for reliability quantification, are available to make the reliability assessment possible.
The digitalization of our society is only possible in the presence of secure and reliable software systems governing ongoing critical processes, so-called critical information infrastructures. The understanding of mutual interdependencies of events and processes is crucial for cybersecurity and software reliability. One of the promising ways to tackle these challenges is process mining, which is a set of techniques that aims to mine essential knowledge from processes, thus providing more perspectives and temporal context to data interpretation and process understanding. However, it is unclear how process mining can help and can be practically used in the context of cybersecurity and reliability. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the potential of process mining to aid in cybersecurity and software reliability to analyze and support research efforts in these areas. Concretely, we collect existing process mining applications, discuss current trends and promising research directions that can be used to tackle the current cybersecurity and software reliability challenges. To this end, we conduct a systematic literature review covering 35 relevant research approaches to examine how the process mining is currently used for these tasks and what are the research gaps and promising research directions in the area. This work is an extension of our previous work, which focused solely on the cybersecurity area, based on the observation of relative closeness and similar goals of those two fields, in which some approaches tend to overlap.
Countries across the world are deeply concerned about the cybercrimes. Experts and practitioners always emphasize on collaborative efforts to investigate and control illegal activities in virtual environment. Countries differ significantly on socio-economic continuum. Due to cultural dissimilarities, criminal activities as well as their causes and consequences also vary from region to region. This study was an effort to identify contextual factors stimulating illegitimate activities in cyber environment and to suggest remedial measures in this regard. With the help of focus group sessions comprising ten participants from diverse background, a discussion was held to explore the causes and consequences of cybercrimes. The consolidated results are presented duly agreed by the panelists.
Prior to the innovation of information communication technologies (ICT), social interactions evolved within small cultural boundaries such as geo spatial locations. The recent developments of communication technologies have considerably transcended the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional communications. These social technologies have created a revolution in user-generated information, online human networks, and rich human behavior-related data. However, the misuse of social technologies such as social media (SM) platforms, has introduced a new form of aggression and violence that occurs exclusively online. A new means of demonstrating aggressive behavior in SM websites are highlighted in this paper. The motivations for the construction of prediction models to fight aggressive behavior in SM are also outlined. We comprehensively review cyberbullying prediction models and identify the main issues related to the construction of cyberbullying prediction models in SM. This paper provides insights on the overall process for cyberbullying detection and most importantly overviews the methodology. Though data collection and feature engineering process has been elaborated, yet most of the emphasis is on feature selection algorithms and then using various machine learning algorithms for prediction of cyberbullying behaviors. Finally, the issues and challenges have been highlighted as well, which present new research directions for researchers to explore.
Voice over IP (VoIP) is increasingly replacing fixed line telephone systems globally due to lower cost, call quality improvements over digital lines and ease of availability. At the same time, criminals have also transitioned to using this environment, creating challenges for law enforcement, since interception of VoIP traffic is more difficult than a traditional telephony environment. One key problem for proprietary VoIP algorithms like Skype is being able to reliably identify and characterize network traffic. In this paper, the latest Skype version and its components are analyzed, in terms of network traffic behavior for logins, calls establishment, call answering and the change status phases. Network conditions tested included blocking different port numbers, inbound connections and outbound connections. The results provide a clearer view of the difficulties in characterizing Skype traffic in forensic contexts. We also found different changes from previous investigations into older versions of Skype.
"The purpose of this article is to formulate proposals to improve the criminal law of the Russian Federation on liability for digital crimes on the basis of a comparative legal study of the UK legislation in this area. The work provides a detailed comparative legal analysis of the UK legislation in the field of combating digital crimes. Based on the study, we proposed some mechanisms for ensuring the security of relations in the digital field. The cross-border nature of these attacks among the main tasks includes unification of legal norms governing the IT sphere, creation of a single mechanism to hold accountable for attacks in the IT sphere worldwide, regardless of geopolitical boundaries. A separate direction of the internal criminal policy of all countries shall be the creation of effective mechanisms for applying the provisions of legislation in the digital sphere; any legislation, even the most progressive, is useless and only declarative in nature without the necessary mechanism for its application. Evidence of the person's guilt is required in order to prosecute. The informational nature of infringements necessitates expanding the boundaries of the powers of law enforcement agencies, which inextricably leads to the problem of finding a balance between observing the freedoms of citizens in the information space and ensuring the universal information security. In the UK, as in all countries of the world, the answer to this question has not yet been found."
Cybercrime has been on the rise in recent years. Cybercriminals target Internet users and commit illegal acts. Malicious web pages are an easy tool to obtain sensitive personal information from Internet users, install malware on their computers, and expose them to cyberspace. More advanced techniques are used by the attackers to inject the malicious code into the normal legitimate webpages or create a web page with illegal content and then spread the URL through various possible media to perform the intended action. Internet users who click the link will be in their nest. Identifying such URLs or web pages can be a daunting task for internet users. So, the researchers using different machine/deep learning methods with different set features that are derived from URL, content, and server-based information of the web page to detect or classify the malicious web pages. Most attacks, including drive-by downloads, phishing, and injections, conceals the maliciously intended code or link in the content of legitimate or purportedly legitimate webpage. Many current research work uses the URL based features due to its risk-free processing. Only less attention is given to the content-based features. That hides the vital area of features to better classification. To address this issue, this paper focus on web content-based features for malicious web page classification. The result shows, the proposed method performs better in terms of accuracy.
The effect of digitization has led to an increased dependency on the internet. At the same time, cyber-attacks are on the rise due to this increased digitization. In cybercrime cases, digital evidence is of utmost importance. The forensic investigation process always begins after the incident occurred, by that time intelligent attackers got enough time to destroy the traces. This paper proposes a prior evidence capture protocol, that will help in the simultaneous collection of evidence when the crime has occurred. This collected evidence is in the form of device fingerprint which will uniquely identify the fingeprintee client device. In the future, if the dispute arises these prior captured device fingerprints can be used as legal evidence and help in the process of forensic investigation. The proposed protocol uses the concept of a trusted time stamping server (TTSS) to prove the integrity and nonrepudiation of the collected evidence. The timestamps are attached by the trusted third party TTSS with all collected evidence, these timestamps cannot be changed by local client devices. The paper also provides security validation of the proposed protocol by using Burrows Abadi Needham (BAN) logic. The formal verification is also done by using the AVISPA tool. The results of AVISPA shows that the proposed protocol is safe under OFMC and Cl-AtSe model. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
Increasing involvement of Nigerian youths in cybercrime and fraud, ritual activities, prostitution, human and drug trafficking, kidnapping, robbery and hired killings reveal the growing materialism of a significant number of Nigerian youths, including uncountable numbers of professed Nigerian Christian youths. There is the need to address materialism amongst Nigerian youths with special reference to Nigerian Christian youths. Paul???s moral instructions to Timothy are still relevant for Nigerian Christian youths to emulate. Therefore, this study employs a redaction critical method of biblical exegesis to interpret and apply 1 Timothy 6:6???14 to the problem of materialism amongst Nigerian Christian youths. This study finds that materialism amongst Nigerian Christian youths is consolidating negative implications to their spiritual lives, families, to the mission mandate of the church and to Nigeria as a nation. This study argues that Paul has shown a model of how a Christian youth ought to be guided with regard to material possessions. Contribution: This study explored the issue of materialism amongst countless Nigerian Christian youths that is consolidating negative implications to their spiritual lives, families, to the church and to Nigeria as a nation. The study recommends that Paul???s instructions to Timothy about godliness and love of money are still relevant for Nigeria Christian youths to emulate.
Background. Cybersecurity controls are deployed to manage risks posed by malicious behaviours or systems. What is not often considered or articulated is how cybersecurity controls may impact legitimate users (often those whose use of a managed system needs to be protected, and preserved). This oversight characterises the `blunt' nature of many cybersecurity controls. Aim. Here we present a framework produced from a synthesis of methods from cybercrime opportunity reduction and behaviour change, and a consideration of existing risk management guidelines. Method. We illustrate the framework and its principles with a range of examples and a potential application focusing on online abuse and social media controls, relating in turn to issues inherent in cyberbullying and tech-abuse. Results. The framework describes a capacity to improve the precision of cybersecurity controls by examining shared determinants of negative and positive behaviours in a system. This identifies opportunities for risk owners to better protect legitimate users while simultaneously acting to prevent malicious activity in a managed system. Conclusions. We describe capabilities for a novel approach to managing sociotechnical cyber-risk which can be integrated into typical risk management processes. This includes consideration of user activities as a system asset to protect, and a consideration of how to engage with other stakeholders to identify behaviours to preserve in a system.
Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data. It extracts an author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected writing styles in the text. The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario-or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for AA. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text representation outperforms the static stylometrics, dynamic n-grams, latent Dirichlet allocation, latent semantic analysis, distributed memory model of paragraph vectors, distributed bag of words version of paragraph vector, word2vec representations, and other baselines.
"In the digital age, the interaction between privacy; data protection and advanced technological developments such as big data analytics has become pertinent to Europol's effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses. For the purposes of preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of its objectives, it is imperative for Europol to employ the fullest and most up-to-date information and technical capabilities possible whilst respecting fundamental human rights. The present article addresses precisely the paradox of on one side protecting fundamental human rights against external terrorist and/or cybercrime intrusions, and on the other providing a privacy-conscious approach to data collection and analytics, so that Europol can even more effectively support and strengthen action in protecting society against internal threats in a proportionate, responsible and legitimate manner. The advantage proposed in this very context of large quantities of data informing strategic analysis at Europol is a purpose-oriented data protection impact assessment. Namely, the evolution from traditional instruments in the fight against organised crime and terrorism to more technologically advanced ones equally requires an alteration of the conventional notions of privacy and investigative and information-sharing methods.

Recent pose-estimation methods enable digitization of human motion by extracting 3D skeleton sequences from ordinary video recordings. Such spatio-temporal skeleton representation offers attractive possibilities for a wide range of applications but, at the same time, requires effective and efficient content-based access to make the extracted data reusable. In this paper, we focus on content-based retrieval of pre-segmented skeleton sequences of human actions to identify the most similar ones to a query action. We mainly deal with the extraction of content-preserving action features, which are learned using the triplet-loss approach in an unsupervised way. Such features are (1) effective as they achieve a similar retrieval quality as the features learned in a supervised way, and (2) of a fixed size which enables the application of indexing structures for efficient retrieval.
A Smart Grid (SG) is a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) idealized with the ultimate goal to reach optimal energy efficiency, a key enabler for the Smart City concept. SG reliability needs to be ensured by an in-depth testing process, involving software/hardware components, network communication, together with quality concerns such as security of the overall infrastructure. While there are many models for modelling/designing SGs (e.g., SGAM), there is no specific testing process model customized for the SGs needs. As such, the aim of this paper is to identify a set of software testing process models developed over the years and investigate their adaptability to SG testing requirements. To reach the goal, we categorize SG requirements from related works with the help of a concept map. Afterwards, the most popular testing process models from literature are discussed in the context of the identified requirements. From a list of 17 main testing models, six testing models (TPI Next, TMMi, Test SPICE, TIM, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119, and MTPF) are considered as potentially adaptable to the SG domain.
Transaction processing is a critical aspect of modern software systems. Such criticality increased over the years with the emergence of microservices, calling for appropriate management of transactions across separated application domains, ensuring the whole system can recover and operate in a possible degraded state. The Saga pattern emerged as a way to define compensating actions in the context of long-lived transactions. In this work, we discuss the relation between traditional transaction processing models and the Saga pattern targeting specifically the distributed environment of reactive microservices applications. In this context, we provide a comparison of the current state of transaction support in four Java-based enterprise application frameworks for microservices support: Axon, Eventuate Event Sourcing (ES), Eventuate Tram, and MicroProfile Long Running Actions (LRA).
This work proposes an end-to-end model for network attack detection and network attack classification using deep learning-based recurrent models. The proposed model extracts the features of hidden layers of recurrent models and further employs a kernel-based principal component analysis (KPCA) feature selection approach to identify optimal features. Finally, the optimal features of recurrent models are fused together and classification is done using an ensemble meta-classifier. Experimental analysis and results of the proposed method on more than one benchmark network intrusion dataset show that the proposed method performed better than the existing methods and other most commonly used machine learning and deep learning models. In particular, the proposed method showed maximum accuracy 99% in network attacks detection and 97% network attacks classification using the SDN-IoT dataset. Similar performances were obtained by the proposed model on other network intrusion datasets such as KDD-Cup-1999, UNSW-NB15, WSN-DS, and CICIDS-2017.
Dynamic development of IT technology poses new challenges related to the cross-border collection of electronic evidence from the cloud. Many times investigators need to secure data stored on foreign servers directly and then look for solutions on how to turn the data into a legitimate source of evidence. To study the situation and propose solutions, I conducted a survey among Polish representatives of public prosecutors' offices and courts. This paper presents information from digital evidence collection practices across multiple jurisdictions. I stated that representatives from the prosecution and the judiciary in Poland are aware of the issues associated with cross-border acquisition and preservation of cloud-based evidence. In their view, many of the problems are time-consuming and ineffective international cooperation, the voluntary nature of cooperation between foreign cloud service providers, lack of harmonized procedures and guidelines, the diversity of legal systems, and the lack of knowledge held by law enforcement officials and the judiciary. This work should be the beginning of an open discussion with practitioners about existing challenges and an invitation for further research with a larger sample of prosecutors and judges. There are no such studies in literature. The paper shows that it is possible to improve current procedures for the cross-border collection of cloud-based digital evidence.
In adversarial classification, the interaction between classifiers and adversaries can be modeled as a game between two players. It is natural to model this interaction as a dynamic game of incomplete information, since the classifier does not know the exact intentions of the different types of adversaries (senders). For these games, equilibrium strategies can be approximated and used as input for classification models. In this paper we show how to model such interactions between players, as well as give directions on how to approximate their mixed strategies. We propose perceptron-like machine learning approximations as well as novel Adversary-Aware Online Support Vector Machines. Results in a real-world adversarial environment show that our approach is competitive with benchmark online learning algorithms, and provides important insights into the complex relations among players.
There are many definitions of software Technical Debt (TD) that were proposed over time. While many techniques to measure TD emerged in recent times, there is still not a clear understanding about how different techniques compare when applied to software projects. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this aspect, by comparing three techniques about TD identification that were proposed over time: (i) the Maintainability Index (MI), (ii) SIG TD models, and (iii) SQALE analysis. Considering 20 open source Python libraries, we compare the TD measurements time series in terms of trends and evolution according to different sets of releases (major, minor, and micro), to see if the perception of practitioners about TD evolution could be impacted. While all methods report generally growing trends of TD over time, there are different patterns. SQALE reports more periods of steady states compared to MI and SIG TD. MI is the method that reports more repayments of TD compared to the other methods. SIG TD and MI are the models that show more similarity in the way TD evolves, while SQALE and MI are less similar. The implications are that each method gives slightly a different perception about TD evolution.
Smart cities aim at integrating various IoT (Internet of Things) technologies by providing many opportunities for the development, governance, and management of user services. One of the ways to support this idea is to use cloud and edge computing techniques to reduce costs, manage resource consumption, enhance performance, and connect the IoT devices more effectively. However, the selection of services remains a significant research question since there are currently different strategies towards cloud computing, including services for central remote computing (traditional cloud model) as well as distributed local computing (edge computing). In this paper, we offer an integrated view of these two directions and the selection among the edge technologies based on MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithms. To this end, we propose a foglet as a middleware that aims at achieving satisfactory levels of customer services by using fuzzy similarity and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to facilitate the rating and selection of services in the fog-to-cloud environment. Then, we describe the selection process with a numerical example, and conclude our work with an outline of future perspectives.
Rapid developments in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a new research field for building sustainable smart cities. VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) is one of the emergent transportation technologies that has a great impact on ensuring mainly traffic management and road safety in urban areas by efficiently using data sharing among vehicles. To further increase the security and safety of passengers and drivers, ITSs are continually striving to make the fusion of emergent network technologies to provide more reliable and efficient services. Relating VANET to UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is an example of this fusion, where UAVs act as an assistant to vehicles aiming to extend the network connectivity while efficiently avoiding obstacles (e.g., Buildings) and providing high data delivery ratios. However, VANET and UAV are still critical security subjects that must be addressed. Advanced Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning) techniques have recently been used to protect VANET and UAV communications against various cyber attacks that deteriorate the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of vehicular data. Thus, in this paper, we focus on reviewing related work on machine learning techniques for intrusion detection systems in VANET- and UAV-aided networks. We also highlight the main open research challenges in literature and provide hints for improving security in ITSs. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
Specialty literature and solutions in the market have been focusing in the last decade on collecting and aggregating significant amounts of data about transactions (and user behavior) and on refining the algorithms used to identify fraud. At the same time, legislation in the European Union has been adopted in the same direction (e.g., PSD2) in order to impose obligations on stakeholders to identify fraud. However, on the one hand, the legislation provides a high-level description of this legal obligation, and on the other hand, the solutions in the market are diversifying in terms of data collected and, especially, attempts to aggregate data in order to generate more accurate results. This leads to an issue that has not been analyzed yet deeply in specialty literature or by legislators, respectively, the privacy concerns in case of profile building and aggregation of data for fraud identification purposes and responsibility of stakeholders in the identification of frauds in the context of their obligations under data protection legislation. This article comes as a building block in this direction of research, as it contains (i) an analysis of existing fraud detection methods and approaches, together with their impact from a data protection legislation perspective and (ii) an analysis of respondents' views toward privacy in case of fraud identification in transactions based on a questionnaire in this respect having 425 respondents. Consequently, this article assists in bridging the gap between data protection legislation and implementation of fraud detection obligations under the law, as it provides recommendations for compliance with the latter legal obligation while also complying with data protection aspects.
Cyberspace is a network of networks connecting billions of users round the globe with the help of networked gadgets that include computers, mobile phones, palmtops, iPods, etc. Internet, though offers great benefit to society, it also presents opportunities for criminals using new and highly sophisticated technology tools. It both poses and suffers from various security challenges as it is used to commit crime and is itself target of crime. It has unveiled many unique challenges like cyber espionage, cyber warfare, cyber terrorism that were not known previously in real space. The technology is constantly evolving which gives birth to a newer crime and a new generation of crimes has come on the horizon. It is in this backdrop that an attempt is made to analyze different facets of cybercrimes together with possible solutions offered by law and technology.
Social networking services (SNS) have increased in popularity over the last decade. They have become major platforms for e-commerce, personal branding, socialization and information. The success of social networking services like Facebook and Twitter as well as LinkedIn, LiveJournal and Foursquare and the variety of their usages leads their users to create a set of profiles on different SNS. Recently, social networking service aggregators have proposed centralizing the multiple social networking profiles of a given user in order to facilitate his interactions with social networking services. Such aggregators allow the messages received by a profile over multiple SNS to be retrieved, edited and posted with much less effort. Despite their obvious advantages, we highlight in this paper the risk of potential data leaks due to the inexperienced use of such tools. For this purpose, we provide a classification of online SNS and present their specificities with regard to the publicly exposed data of a user. Based on this classification, we investigate the possible insecure use of aggregators with an inappropriate set of SNS, which could lead to rendering sensitive data accessible to people it wasn't intended for. We present a decision tree approach for identifying a possible data leak based on the three following criteria: opinion, interest and location. We finally show the result of this approach on popular social networking aggregators.
Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have revolutionized many critical domains by providing cost-effective, automated, and intelligent solutions. Recently, ChatGPT has achieved a momentous change and made substantial progress in natural language processing. As such, a chatbot-driven AI technology has the capabilities to interact and communicate with users and generate human-like responses. ChatGPT, on the other hand, has the potential to influence changes in the cybersecurity domain. ChatGPT can be utilized as a chatbot-driven security assistant for penetration testing to analyze, investigate, and develop security solutions. However, ChatGPT raises concerns about how the tool can be used for cybercrime and malicious activities. Attackers can use such a tool to cause substantial harm by exploiting vulnerabilities, writing malicious code, and circumventing security measures on a targeted system. This article investigates the implications of the ChatGPT model in the domain of cybersecurity. We present the state-of-the-art practical applications of ChatGPT in cybersecurity. In addition, we demonstrate in a case study how a ChatGPT can be used to design and develop False data injection attacks against critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Conversely, we show how such a tool can be used to help security analysts to analyze, design, and develop security solutions against cyberattacks. Finally, this article discusses the open challenges and future directions of ChatGPT in cybersecurity.
Over the past two decades, social media have become a crucial and omnipresent cultural and economic phenomenon, which has seen platforms come and go and advance technologically. In this study, we explore the further development of social media regarding interactive technologies, platform development, relationships to news media, the activities of institutional and organizational users, and effects of social media on the individual and the society over the next five to ten years by conducting an international, two-stage Delphi study. Our results show that enhanced interaction on platforms, including virtual and augmented reality, somatosensory sense, and touch- and movement-based navigation are expected. AIs will interact with other social media users. Inactive user profiles will outnumber active ones. Platform providers will diversify into the WWW, e-commerce, edu-tech, fintechs, the automobile industry, and HR. They will change to a freemium business model and put more effort into combating cybercrime. Social media will become the predominant news distributor, but fake news will still be problematic. Firms will spend greater amounts of their budgets on social media advertising, and schools, politicians, and the medical sector will increase their social media engagement. Social media use will increasingly lead to individuals' psychic issues. Society will benefit from economic growth and new jobs, increased political interest, democratic progress, and education due to social media. However, censorship and the energy consumption of platform operators might rise.
The cyber threat is highly dynamic and evolves in parallel with the innovation of systems and communications, which are outside the control of government authorities and respond exclusively to business logic and free initiative, often contingent on implementation of illegal activities. In particular, the threat posed by the criminal use of the Internet goes far beyond the cybercrime, in particular with the Tor network, where black markets are shifted with the shape of renown legal marketplaces as Ebay and Amazon. Hence even common crime can benefit of new modus operandi and new routes to deliver illegal goods or services, enforcing new investigation techniques to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). This paper formerly analyses the goods/services categories of fourteen Tor marketplaces and the related vendors, while the last one provides a discussion on a novel investigative technique related to PGP Keys inter-relations. In particular, with the evolution/growth of the markets, the vendors are increasingly adopting open source tools and technologies, as PGP, which can be exploited to infer information such as the established relationships between users. This public information about the keys can be used to retrace social network of entities connected by PGP relationship and apply well-established graph analysis techniques. Finally, the paper analyses the strength and weaknesses of proposed methods, depicting future research directions.
Junk mail or spam mail has been regarded as a major problem in today's world. The spam mail can lead to cybercrime that impacts all individuals and organization. Many people and businesses seek for spam mail prevention technique in order to protect their own data and computer system. The spam mails normally contain advertise products or services contents and also conveys viruses, malwares, spywares and so forth. Many people thought spam mails do not cause any damage. In fact, the spam mails made a management cost increased and resources will be used ineffectively. Therefore, verifying and filtering spam mails need to be taken into consideration. The objective of this paper is to introduce the hybrid approach, which combines three techniques including stop-word removal, n-gram extraction and data classification, for filtering spam emails and simplifies system development. The proposed hybrid approach can be widely applied for all different languages due to being language independent technique. To examine the approach, CSDMC2010 spam mail corpus comprising of 198 common emails, 202 spam mails, and 10 selective emails were used in experimental study. The results showed that the proposed technique enabled to monitor whether the email is spam with 93.2% accuracy. Hence, this hybrid approach could provide benefits for all users and organization to decrease the computer risk.
Purpose - The purpose of the study is to conduct a scientometric analysis of cybersecurity literature indexed in the core collection of the Web of Science for a period of ten years (2011-2020). Design/methodology/approach - Cybersecurity is a focused topic of research across the globe. To identify the global research productivity in the field, the terms cybersecurity, cyber-security, web security, information security, computer security, etc. were used for retrieving the publications in the advanced search mode of the database Web of Science, limiting the time frame for 2011-2020. The results retrieved were downloaded in the Excel file for further analysis and interpretation. The harvested data was analysed by using scientometric techniques to measure the progress such as growth rate, doubling time and author collaborations.

Originality/value - The study is the scientometric analysis of the cybersecurity based on current literature and will highlight the progress and development of global research in the said field.
Emails are often used to illegal cybercrime today, so it is important to verify the identity of the email author. This paper proposes a general model for solving the problem of anonymous email author attribution, which can be used in email authorship identification and email authorship verification. The first situation is to find the author of an anonymous email among the many suspected targets. Another situation is to verify if an email was written by the sender. This paper extracts features from the email header and email body and analyzes the writing style and other behaviors of email authors. The behaviors of email authors are extracted through a statistical algorithm from email headers. Moreover, the author's writing style in the email body is extracted by a sequence-to-sequence bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) algorithm. This model combines multiple factors to solve the problem of anonymous email author attribution. The experiments proved that the accuracy and other indicators of proposed model are better than other methods. In email authorship verification experiment, our average accuracy, average recall and average F1-score reached 89.9 %. In email authorship identification experiment, our model's accuracy rate is 98.9% for 10 authors, 92.9% for 25 authors and 89.5% for 50 authors.
"The 21st century is called the digital century. The digital world and modern mobile digital technologies are everywhere today. This shift in technology development brings not only huge benefits but also huge risks. Digital crime is one of the fastest-growing criminal activities, with more than a million people becoming victims of it worldwide every day. The peculiarity of these crimes is that, due to the development of digital technologies, the content of crime has changed; and most of it is committed in a virtual environment. For many years, the international community and states have been attempting to counter the commission of crimes using computer technology. Conventions, agreements, recommendations, and laws are adopted. But at present, they do not fully reflect the situation in this area. No less attention is paid to the problems caused by using modern technologies in the scientific literature. But there is no unity of opinion, most of the writings use such mostly outdated terms as computer crime, cybercrime, etc. At the same time, an analysis of the state of crime in this field, as well as of legislation and scientific literature, shows that there is a need for clarification of the existing concept of computer crime, expanding it to the concept of the digital crime."
Electronic transactions rank the top on our daily transactions. Internet became invaluable for government, business, and personal use. This occurred in synchronization with the great increase in online attacks, particularly the development of newest forms from known attacks such as Tabnabbing. Thus, users' confidentiality and personal information must be protected using information security. Tabnabbing is a new form of phishing. The attacker needs nothing to steal credentials except users' preoccupation with other work and exploitation of human memory weakness. The impact of this malicious attempt begins with identity theft and ends with financial loss. That has encouraged some security specialists and researchers to tackle tabnabbing attack, but their studies are still in their infancy and not sufficient. The work done here focuses on developing an effective anti-tabnabbing extension for the Google Chrome browser to protect Internet users from been victims as well as raise their awareness. The system developed has a novel significance due to its effectiveness in detecting a tabnabbing attack and the combination of two famous approaches used to combat online attacks. The success of the system was examined by performance measurements such as confusion matrix and ROC. The system produces promising results.
"Using e-services in Saudi Arabia is growing. Using such services offers a wide range of benefits and makes people's life easier. However, the development and the deployment of these e-services on the Internet increase the likelihood of exposure to cyber-attacks. Attackers take advantage of vulnerabilities in these e-services. Vulnerabilities arise as a result of weaknesses in the programming, miss-configuration or lack of updates. It is unfortunate that only little effort is done to evaluate the security posture of Saudi Arabia's websites. In this paper, 150 Financial, Academic, Governmental and commercial organizations websites were assessed using open source tools. In addition, a comparison between governmental and commercial websites was done based on the numbers of vulnerabilities found. The results show that Saudi Arabia's websites suffer from high, medium and low impact vulnerabilities. For example; 17.5% of websites are vulnerable to SQL injection, 13.5% are vulnerable to Shell injection, and 61% are vulnerable to Clickjacking. Finally, the evaluation showed that commercial websites are more secure than governmental websites."
The social impact of technology has become one of the most challenging research issues. One of the most famous information technology is BitTorrent, a protocol for peer to peer file sharing. This paper discusses an ethical issue related to Peer to Peer file sharing using BitTorrent protocol of copyrighted materials. We choose an academic approach by choosing an ethical analysis tool that allows pros and cons opinions amongst different points of view. We studied this issue in Saudi community by distributing the questionnaires and analyzing its results. The result reveals that a large percentage of the participants were using Torrent to download movies and music illegally and half of them do not even realize that it is considered as illegal. Hence, it is suggested that in order to reduce the illegal use of a promising technology is to raise the awareness of the issue to the society.
With the rapid increase of published open datasets, it is crucial to support the open data progress in smart cities while considering the open data quality. In the Czech Republic, and its National Open Data Catalogue (NODC), the open datasets are usually evaluated based on their metadata only, while leaving the content and the adherence to the recommended data structure to the sole responsibility of the data providers. The interoperability of open datasets remains unknown. This paper therefore aims to propose a novel content-aware quality evaluation framework that assesses the quality of open datasets based on five data quality dimensions. With the proposed framework, we provide a fundamental view on the interoperability-oriented data quality of Czech open datasets, which are published in NODC. Our evaluations find that domain-specific open data quality assessments are able to detect data quality issues beyond traditional heuristics used for determining Czech open data quality, increase their interoperability, and thus increase their potential to bring value for the society. The findings of this research are beneficial not only for the case of the Czech Republic, but also can be applied in other countries that intend to enhance their open data quality evaluation processes.
For decades, the success of the similarity search has been based on a detailed quantification of pairwise similarity of objects. Currently, the search features have become much more precise but also bulkier, and the similarity computations more time-consuming. While the k nearest neighbours (kNN) search dominates the real-life applications, we claim that it is principally free of a need for precise similarity quantifications. Based on the well-known fact that a selection of the most similar alternative out of several options is a much easier task than deciding the absolute similarity scores, we propose the search based on an epistemologically simpler concept of relational similarity. Having arbitrary objects q, o(1) , o(2) from the search domain, the kNN search is solvable just by the ability to choose the more similar object to q out of o(1), o(2) - the decision can also contain a neutral option. We formalise such searching and discuss its advantages concerning similarity quantifications, namely its efficiency and robustness. We also propose a pioneering implementation of the relational similarity search for the Euclidean spaces and report its extreme filtering power in comparison with 3 contemporary techniques.
As the complexity of Internet services, transmission speed, and data volume increases, current IP flow monitoring and analysis approaches cease to be sufficient, especially within high-speed and large-scale networks. Although IP flows consist only of selected network traffic features, their processing faces high computational demands, analysis delays, and large storage requirements. To address these challenges, we propose to improve the IP flow monitoring workflow by stream-based collection and analysis of IP flows utilizing a distributed data stream processing. This approach requires changing the paradigm of IP flow data monitoring and analysis, which is the main goal of our research. We analyze distributed stream processing systems, for which we design a novel performance benchmark to determine their suitability for stream-based processing of IP flow data. We define a stream-based workflow of IP flow collection and analysis based on the benchmark results, which we also implement as a publicly available and open-source framework Stream4Flow. Furthermore, we propose new analytical methods that leverage the stream-based IP flow data processing approach and extend network monitoring and threat detection capabilities.
Effective triage is of utmost importance for cyber-security incident response, namely in handling ransomware or similar incidents in which the attacker may use self-propagating worms, infected files, or email attachments to spread malware. If a device is infected, it is vital to know which other devices can be infected too or are immediately threatened. The number and heterogeneity of devices in today's network complicate situational awareness of incident handlers, and, thus, we propose a recommender system that uses network monitoring data to prioritize devices in the network based on their similarity and proximity to an already infected device. The system enumerates devices in close proximity in terms of physical and logical network topology and sorts them by their similarity given by the similarity of their behavioral profile, fingerprint, or common history. The incident handlers can use the recommendation to promptly prevent malware from spreading or trace the attacker's lateral movement.
Hands-on computing education requires a realistic learning environment that enables students to gain and deepen their skills. Available learning environments, including virtual and physical laboratories, provide students with real-world computer systems but rarely adapt the learning environment to individual students of various proficiency and background. We design a unique and novel smart environment for the adaptive training of cybersecurity skills. The environment collects a variety of student data to assign a suitable learning path through the training. To enable such adaptiveness, we propose, develop, and deploy a new tutor model and a training format. We evaluate the learning environment using two different adaptive trainings attended by 114 students of various proficiency. The results show that students were assigned tasks with a more appropriate difficulty, which enabled them to successfully complete the training. Students reported that they enjoyed the training, felt the training difficulty was appropriately designed, and would attend more training sessions like these. Instructors can use the environment for teaching any topic involving real-world computer networks and systems because it is not tailored to particular training. We freely release the software along with exemplary training so that other instructors can adopt the innovations in their teaching practice.
The integration of renewable sources, communication and power networks with information and communication technologies is one of the main challenges in Smart Grids (SG) large-scale testing. For this reason, the coupling of simulators is commonly used to dynamically simulate several aspects of the SG infrastructure, in the so-called co-simulations. In this paper, we provide a scoping review of research of co-simulations in the context of Smart Grids: i) research areas and research problems addressed by co-simulations, ii) specific co-simulation aspects focus of research, iii) typical coupling of simulators in co-simulation studies. Based on the results, we discuss research directions of future SG co-simulation research in each of the identified areas.
There are different requirements on cybersecurity of industrial control systems and information technology systems. This fact exacerbates the global issue of hiring cybersecurity employees with relevant skills. In this paper, we present KYPO4INDUSTRY training facility and a course syllabus for beginner and intermediate computer science students to learn cybersecurity in a simulated industrial environment. The training facility is built using opensource hardware and software and provides reconfigurable modules of industrial control systems. The course uses a flipped classroom format with hands-on projects: the students create educational games that replicate real cyber attacks. Throughout the semester, they learn to understand the risks and gain capabilities to respond to cyber attacks that target industrial control systems. Our described experience from the design of the testbed and its usage can help any educator interested in teaching cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems.
The increasing adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices present new challenges to digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when investigation into cybercrime on these new platforms are required. However, there has been no formal study to document actual challenges faced by investigators and whether existing tools help them in their work. Prior issues such as the correlation and consistency problem in digital forensic evidence have also become a pressing concern in light of numerous evidence sources from IoT devices. Motivated by these observations, we conduct a user study with 39 digital forensic investigators from both public and private sectors to document the challenges they faced in traditional and IoT digital forensics. We also created a tool, STITCHER, that addresses the technical challenges faced by investigators when handling loT digital forensics investigation. We simulated an IoT crime that mimics sophisticated cybercriminals and invited our user study participants to utilize STITCHER to investigate the crime. The efficacy of STITCHER is confirmed by our study results where 96.2% of users indicated that STITCHER assisted them in handling the crime, and 61.5% of users who used STITCHER with its full features solved the crime completely.

An increased use of data driven applications and integrated systems have caused an accelerating expansion in data volumes and increase in the number of digital records, over the past few decades. Exponentially growing data volumes being processed by large-scale distributed data-intensive applications have placed an increasing pressure on the underlying storage services for timely and efficient storage and retrieval of the data. The use of cloud storage is among the best strategies to efficiently store growing volumes of data. However, outsourcing data to public cloud storage leads to the challenge of data confidentiality preservation. Data Confidentiality is among the top challenges associated with cloud storage which have contributed substantially as an inhibitor for cloud computing adoption all over the world and is considered a serious concern, especially in case of big data, where securing data in a timely and accurate manner is an arduous task. Our study aims to contribute in anti-cybercrime by protecting the confidentiality of sensitive growing data. We enunciate an optimized confiden-tially preserving framework on distributed cloud storage, that works for growing data with time-efficiency and minimum memory usage. Our framework uses a merger of Genetic Algorithm (GA), parallel data distribution, and privacy-aware selective encryption techniques. The experiments and comparative analysis depict that our proposed framework outperforms others under consideration, in terms of execution time, memory usage and network throughput respectively.
Cybercrime has led to the loss of billions of dollars, the malfunctioning of computer systems, the destruction of critical information, the compromising of network integrity and confidentiality, etc. In view of these crimes committed on a daily basis, the security of the computer systems has become imperative to minimize and possibly avoid the impact of cybercrimes. In this paper, we review recent advances in the use of cyber security benchmark datasets for the evaluation of machine learning and data mining-based intrusion detection systems. It was found that the state-of-the-art cyber security benchmark datasets KDD and UNM are no longer reliable, because their datasets cannot meet the expectations of current advances in computer technology. As a result, a new ADFA Linux (ADFA-LD) cyber security benchmark dataset for the evaluation of machine learning and data mining-based intrusion detection systems was proposed in 2013 to meet the current significant advances in computer technology. ADFA-LD requires improvement in terms of full descriptions of its attributes. This review can be used by the research community as a basis for abandoning the previous state-of-the-art cyber security benchmark datasets and starting to use the newly introduced benchmark dataset for effective and robust evaluation of machine learning and data mining-based intrusion detection system.

Sequential pattern mining, which is one of the core tasks in data mining, allows to gain insight into datasets with complex sequential data. As the task is computationally intensive, there are many different approaches that are suitable for various types of data. We explore the possibility of optimising the analysis of sequences based on the characteristic (quickly obtainable) properties of the analysed data. In this paper, we propose five such characteristics and explore the efficiency of three algorithms that are representatives of the three main approaches to sequential pattern mining. We discovered that it is possible to save up to 21% of the search time compared to the best-performing representative. We trained a decision tree model with 87% accuracy of choosing the best algorithm for selected data based on these characteristics.
We present a new approach to tackle the problem of lattice-type metamorphic robots reconfiguration. We base our approach on a reduction to satisfiability modulo theory (SMT). Unlike the current state-of-the-art solutions, we consider the spatial limitations of the modules themselves and produce collision-free plans. We give an in-depth description of the reduction and discuss several optimizations for our technique. We also show an experimental evaluation of our approach and list possible future improvements to our technique.
Software engineers widely acknowledge the inclusion of security requirements in the early stages of the development process. However, the need to prepare the software for the failure of the implemented security controls and subsequent investigation of the incident is often not discussed. Forensic-ready software systems represent an evolution of secure systems being designed for the eventual digital forensic investigation. However, their exact properties remain largely unexplored, beyond preliminary high-level conceptualizations of requirements and capabilities. Further obstacles hindering the adoption of forensic-ready software systems are the different priorities and goals of involved parties and a gap in the digital forensics expertise of software engineers. In this paper, we conduct an empirical qualitative study identifying the problems and needs of forensic readiness while framing the notion of an ideal forensic-ready software system and how it should treat potential evidence. To this end, we conducted semisupervised interviews with digital forensics experts on their idea, experience, and suggestions. The results provide insights into the needs of the experts to facilitate the definition of correct requirements towards forensic-ready software systems to support the anticipated investigations properly.
Unquestionably, WhatsApp is one of the most pervasive instant message application programs in contemporary digital era. It could be utilized on mobile smart phones or desktop computing devices including Windows-based personal computers and MacBook with Mac OS X. On account of the tremendous amount of information security incidences occurring concerning the usage of WhatsApp program on a MacBook, this research work constructed several cases to validate the recoverability of digital evidences on the computing device. The recoverability of WhatsApp user ID, username, and the contents of instant message dialogues were discussed based on the physical memory acquisition of the MacBook from digital forensics point of view. In addition, by the inherent characteristics and the executing mechanism of the WhatsApp program, the manufacture and the mode of the smartphone was capable of being disclosed by the digital traces accordingly. All the aforementioned disclosed digital traces could be probative digital evidences in a court of law. Therefore, this research work could be substantively applied and extended to other mushrooming cybercrime investigations regarding instant message incidents in the public sector or the noncompliance of computing resource usages in the private sector. The procedures of physical memory acquisition should be scientifically premeditated and systematically conducted due to the volatility of the physical memory of a computing device with rigorous procedures.
Blockchains have emerged over time as a reliable and secure way to record transactions in an immutable manner in a wide range of application domains. However, current related solutions are not yet capable of appropriately checking the authenticity of data when their volumes are huge. They are not also capable of updating Blockchain data blocks and synchronizing them within reasonable timeframes. This is the case within the specific context of Blockchain vehicular networks, where these solutions are commonly cumbersome when attempting to add new vehicles to the network. In order to address these problems, we propose in this paper a new Blockchain-based solution that intelligently implement selective communication and collaborative endorsement approaches to reduce communications between vehicles. Our solution represents the vehicles of the Blockchain as intelligent software agents with a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Furthermore, we propose an approach based on multi-endorsement levels to exchange data of varying sensitive categories. This approach, which is based on endorsing scores, is also used to shorten the admission of new vehicles into the Blockchain. We run simulations using the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain tool. Results show the efficiency of our solution in reducing the processing times of transactions within two different scenarios.
The proliferation of malware in recent times have accounted for the increase in computer crimes and prompted for a more aggressive research into improved investigative strategies, to keep up with the menace. Recent techniques and tools that have been developed and adopted to keep up in an arms race with malware authors who have resorted to the use of evasive techniques to avoid analysis during investigation is an on-going concern. Exploring dynamic analysis is unarguably, a positive step to supporting static evidence with malware dynamic behaviour logs. In view of this, analysing this huge generated reports raises concerns about speed, accuracy and performance. This research proposes an Automated Malware Investigative Framework Model, a component based approach that is designed to support investigation by integrating both malware analysis and data mining clustering techniques as part of an effort to solve the problem of overly generated reports. Thus, grouping analysed suspicious samples that exhibit similar behavioural features to make investigation easy and more intuitive. The focus of this paper however, is on implementing sub-components of the framework that directly deals with the problem at hand.
Recent studies have investigated the link between online advertising and rogue websites promoting film piracy, in several different countries around Asia-Pacific. The key findings are that high risk advertising dominates sites which are geared towards Hollywood TV and movies in English, yet mainstream advertising tends to be more prevalent on sites in local languages with local content. In this first systematic analysis of music piracy, the prevalence of high risk and mainstream advertising on music rogue sites was estimated. Advertising was measured from 3,210 web pages identified as infringing by Google, according to the DMCA, and advertisements were downloaded with a New Zealand IP address, to replicate what New Zealand users would have seen. New Zealand was selected because the founder of the Megaupload file hosting website - previously among the Top 100 websites worldwide - has recently been the subject of a police investigation into criminal copyright infringement. The results show that 93% of advertisements were high risk, and only 7% were mainstream. Disturbingly, 97.24% of the high risk ads were for malware - much higher than for movie websites - suggesting that Kiwis are at extreme risk for malware infection if they visit these sites. Further research on the malware samples downloaded needs to be undertaken to determine if rogue music websites are a vector for banking malware.
We present a dataset of 13446 shell commands from 175 participants who attended cybersecurity training and solved assignments in the Linux terminal. Each acquired data record contains a command with its arguments and metadata, such as a timestamp, working directory, and host identification in the emulated training infrastructure. The commands were captured in Bash, ZSH, and Metasploit shells. The data are stored as JSON records, enabling vast possibilities for their further use in research and development. These include educational data mining, learning analytics, student modeling, and evaluating machine learning models for intrusion detection. The data were collected from 27 cybersecurity training sessions using an open-source logging toolset and two open-source interactive learning environments. Researchers and developers may use the dataset or deploy the learning environments with the logging toolset to generate their own data in the same format. Moreover, we provide a set of common analytical queries to facilitate the exploratory analysis of the dataset. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
Smart Grids (SG) represent one of the key critical infrastructures. Over time, several ontologies were defined in the SG domain to model aspects such as devices and sensors integration, and prosumers' communication needs. In this paper, we review the state of the art regarding semantic web reasoning in the domain of SGs. We compare five main ontologies in terms of descriptive statistics (e.g., number of axioms), load time and reasoners runtime performance. Results show that not all the ontologies in the SG domain are readily available, and that some of them might be more appropriate for deployment in devices with limited computational resources.
At this time the economy around the world was down due to the impact of the covid-19 virus which caused many people to lose their jobs and find it difficult to find work. The Economic Crisis has made people put emotion ahead of logic, in meeting their needs by accepting offers to borrow money from illegal online lending which provides very high administration and interest expenses. One of the factors that also causes people to fall into online lending is a lifestyle that is too high, namely the consumptive nature of shopping excessively not according to their needs or what is called hedonism, which makes them the target of online lenders. The existence of an easy disbursement system, attractive offers, and coupled a lack of financial literacy has made many people ensnared. This gives interest to the author to analyze the fraud committed by illegal online lending actors. The results of the study showed indications of fraud that caused losses. The losses experienced are not only financial but also non-financial. Financial losses experienced due to high admin fees, high interest, the imposition of unlimited fines, and the existence of cybercrime. Non-financial losses experienced were defamation, dissemination of personal data, threats, sexual harassment, and intimidation from illegal lenders. With these losses, illegal online lending users can become stressed, panicked, and can even cause someone to commit suicide [1].
Many companies are making the move to a cloud based environment for data storage and management. Having their data in the cloud has many benefits in that it may help the company move forward and innovate. The embracing of cloud-based services by corporates, businesses, and people, has helped to usher in a paradigm shift in the people-data-service relationship. While most steps in the evolution of technology center around development and productivity, given the changing scenario of threats and cybercrime, security in the cloud needs to be thoroughly analyzed, researched, and mitigated, even if it cannot be completely eliminated or avoided. However, cloud-based environments are not completely safe from attacks. Criminals are always looking for ways to make money through malicious activity. Cyber Security is already one of the fastest growing fields in the modern world and the number of incidents that occur on a daily basis are continuing evidence of its necessity. Systems security of all types have been addressed in similar ways but cloud-base environments offer quite a few unique threats that force professionals to become creative when preparing mitigation techniques. This paper introduce a cloud computing security analysis survey where we list out some of the grave security threats that the Workload Distribution and Resource Pooling Architecture in Cloud Systems model faces, and some mitigation techniques to encounter them.
In recent years, cybercrime activities have grown significantly, compromising device security and jeopardizing the normal activities of enterprises. The profits obtained through intimidation and the limitations for tracking down the illegal transactions have created a lucrative business based on the hijacking of users' files. In this context, ransomware takes advantage of cryptography to compromise the user information or deny access to the operating system. Then, the attacker extorts the victim to pay a ransom in order to regain access, recover the data, or keep the information private. Nowadays, the adoption of Situational Awareness (SA) and cognitive approaches can facilitate the rapid identification of ransomware threats. SA allows knowing what is happening in compromised devices and network communications through monitoring, aggregation, correlation, and analysis tasks. The current literature provides some parameters that are monitored and analyzed in order to prevent these kinds of attacks at an early stage. However, there is no complete list of them. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first proposal that summarizes the parameters evaluated in this research field and considers the SA concept. Furthermore, there are several articles that tackle ransomware problems. However, there are few surveys that summarize the current situation in the area, not only regarding its evolution but also its issues and future challenges. This survey also provides a classification of ransomware articles based on detection and prevention approaches.
In most cases, one of the major goals of behavioral malware analysis is to extract from malware samples the intelligence critical to identify the nature of malware. Given the increasing complexity of operating system and its services that creates a significant volume of noise in the background, malware intelligence gathering process is required to minimise non malware related information while not missing malware related events. Another highly demanded attribute in behavioral analysis is the analysis scalability that enables automated analysis on sizeable sample volumes. It is also desirable to perform the analysis in unobstructed manner providing resiliency to rootkits and analysis-specific evasion techniques. This paper introduces an efficient behavioral malware analysis method, Execution Tracking, that creates critical malware intelligence with minimum volume of unnecessary information and maximum accuracy, which helps acquiring baseline information for further deep analysis, automating analysis process for a high malware volume lab, and producing strategies to mitigate the threats. This method is demonstrated by a reference implementation, Malware Expert.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud domain brings great benefits of an elastic platform with many prefabricated services, but at the same time challenges software architects who need to navigate a rich set of services, variability of PaaS cloud environment and quality conflicts in existing design tactics, which makes it almost impossible to foresee the impact of architectural design decisions on the overall application quality without time-consuming implementation of application prototypes. To ease the architecture design of PaaS cloud applications, this paper proposes a design-time quality evaluation approach for PaaS cloud applications based on automatically generated prototypes, which are deployed to the cloud and repeatedly evaluated in the context of multiple quality attributes and environment configurations. In this paper, all steps of the approach are described and demonstrated on an example of a real-world complex IoT system for collection and processing of Smart Home sensor data. The approach has been implemented and the automated prototype generation and evaluation tool, referred to as PaaSArch Cloud Prototyper, is presented together with the approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Fingerprinting a host's operating system is a very common yet precarious task in network, asset, and vulnerability management. Estimating the operating system via network traffic analysis may leverage TCP/IP header parameters or complex analysis of hosts' behavior using machine learning. However, the existing approaches are becoming obsolete as network traffic evolves which makes the problem still open. This paper discusses various approaches to passive OS fingerprinting and their evolution in the past twenty years. We illustrate their usage, compare their results in an experiment, and list challenges faced by the current fingerprinting approaches. The hosts' differences in network stack settings were initially the most important information source for OS fingerprinting, which is now complemented by hosts' behavioral analysis and combined approaches backed by machine learning. The most impactful reasons for this evolution were the Internet-wide network traffic encryption and the general adoption of privacy-preserving concepts in application protocols. Other changes, such as the increasing proliferation of web applications on handheld devices, raised the need to identify these devices in the networks, for which we may use the techniques of OS fingerprinting.
The design and development of secure systems is an important and challenging task. However, such systems should also be prepared for eventual disputes or occurrences of a security incident. To solve this, forensicready software systems are, by-design, prepared to assist in the forensic investigation and to provide on-point data with high evidentiary value. However, software engineering support for the systematic development of such software systems is rather sparse. This paper tackles the problem by introducing novel modelling notation, called BPMN for Forensic-Ready Software Systems (BPMN4FRSS), including its syntax and semantics. The notation aims to capture the forensic-ready controls and enable reasoning over them, primarily focusing on potential digital evidence. Importantly, it is made to support forensic readiness oriented risk management decisions. The approach is then demonstrated in a scenario where the controls, which mitigate security and business risks, are properly represented.
Filtering is a fundamental strategy of metric similarity indexes to minimise the number of computed distances. Given a triple of objects for which distances of two pairs are known, the lower and upper bounds on the third distance can be set as the difference and the sum of these two already known distances, due to the triangle inequality rule of the metric space. For efficiency reasons, the tightness of bounds is crucial, but as angles within triangles of distances can be arbitrary, the worst case with zero and straight angles must also be considered for correctness. However, in data of real-life applications, the distribution of possible angles is skewed and extremes are very unlikely to occur. In this paper, we enhance the existing definition of bounds on the unknown distance with information about possible angles within triangles. We show that two lower bounds and one upper bound on each distance exist in case of limited angles. We analyse their filtering power and confirm high improvements of efficiency by experiments on several real-life datasets.
This research addresses adding the encryption technic and a digital signature technic to web-based electronic archive in order to prevent cybercrime problem such as robbery, modification and unauthorized access. The Secure Electronic Archive Application intends to combine given services such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non repudiation. Encryption is used to give a confidentiality service with 128 bit AES algorithm. In this research encryption implements to give a confidential service with 128 bit AES algorithm. AES 128 bit algorithm has not been exposed to related key attack. The digital signature is used to provide integrity, authentication, and non repudiation with SHA 256 bit and RSA 1024 bit. The Application will be secured by entering the archive name, symmetric key, private key, and passphrase. Implemented in web programming, Analysis of the application will be explained by a use case diagram and the testing would be web testing. Such as Functional testing, Usability Testing, Interface Testing, Compatibility Testing, Performance Test, and Security Test. Encryption implementation in this research can prevent archive thievery which is shown on implementation and proved on web testing. As the result of Functional Testing, the archive can not be read after it has been encrypted. Therefore, the aplication can give information about archive modification and authentication with showing a notification after the sign has been done.
Authentication mechanisms are at the forefront of defending the world from various types of cybercrime. Steganography can serve as an authentication solution through the use of a digital signature embedded in a carrier object to ensure the integrity of the object and simultaneously lighten the burden of metadata management. Nevertheless, despite being generally imperceptible to human sensory systems, any degree of steganographic distortion might be inadmissible in fidelity-sensitive situations such as forensic science, legal proceedings, medical diagnosis and military reconnaissance. This has led to the development of reversible steganography. A fundamental element of reversible steganography is predictive analytics, for which powerful neural network models have been effectively deployed. Another core element is reversible steganographic coding. Contemporary coding is based primarily on heuristics, which offers a shortcut towards sufficient, but not necessarily optimal, capacity-distortion performance. While attempts have been made to realise automatic coding with neural networks, perfect reversibility is unattainable via such learning machinery. Instead of relying on heuristics and machine learning, we aim to derive optimal coding by means of mathematical optimisation. In this study, we formulate reversible steganographic coding as a nonlinear discrete optimisation problem with a logarithmic capacity constraint and a quadratic distortion objective. Linearisation techniques are developed to enable iterative mixed-integer linear programming. Experimental results validate the near-optimality of the proposed optimisation algorithm when benchmarked against a brute-force method.
Due to the interoperability difficulty and development bottleneck of various services in a city, the effective design of services has become a critical concern in smart city ecosystems. Based on the interconnection concept of Management by Competencies, this paper proposes an DISDA architecture to facilitate the digital service design in a smart city ecosystem. The DISDA architecture not only can guide the users to design the services with the defined processes but also can measure the maturity of the existing services and determine possible service improvements. Based on the proposed service design architecture, we conduct a case study to validate the usability and applicability of the proposed service design architecture.
Catastrophic events, such as cyclones, floods, droughts, terrorism, or cybercrime, are astronomically on the increase the world over. These events disrupt businesses' smooth continuity leading to reputational digital data and financial losses among others. Zimbabwe's districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge in March 2019 experienced a catastrophic Cyclone Idai that highly disrupted various important business activities and the associated supply chains. This study, therefore, focuses on the impact of business continuity and organizational performance on mitigating the disruptive effects on major supply chains during a disaster. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was used to analyse the relationship between supply chain disruption and business continuity. The study had a population of 82 humanitarian organizations and the researchers successfully administered questionnaires to a sample of 65 humanitarian organizations that participated in relief operations during Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe. The results show that business continuity has a negative and significant effect on supply chain disruption. At 5% level of significance, business continuity has a positive effect of about 8%. This means that a marginal change in business continuity will result in significant 8% influence on mitigation of supply chain disruption in humanitarian relief efforts. The study findings will be useful to practitioners such as supply chain managers in coming up with strategies in case of supply chain disruption threats due to unseen shocks.
Cybercrime has increased considerably in recent times by creating new methods of stealing, changing, and destroying data in daily lives. Portable Docu-ment Format (PDF) has been traditionally utilized as a popular way of spreading malware. The recent advances of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are utilized to detect and classify malware. With this motivation, this study focuses on the design of mayfly optimization with a deep belief network for PDF malware detection and classification (MFODBN-MDC) technique. The major intention of the MFODBN-MDC technique is for identifying and classify-ing the presence of malware exist in the PDFs. The proposed MFODBN-MDC method derives a new MFO algorithm for the optimal selection of feature subsets. In addition, Adamax optimizer with the DBN model is used for PDF malware detection and classification. The design of the MFO algorithm to select features and Adamax based hyperparameter tuning for PDF malware detection and classi-fication demonstrates the novelty of the work. For demonstrating the improved outcomes of the MFODBN-MDC model, a wide range of simulations are exe-cuted, and the results are assessed in various aspects. The comparison study high-lighted the enhanced outcomes of the MFODBN-MDC model over the existing techniques with maximum precision, recall, and F1 score of 97.42%, 97.33%, and 97.33%, respectively.
This article explores the extent to which Covid-19 has impacted the trajectory of EU Cybersecurity Policy. The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19 related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive institutionalism, that the EU's response to Covid-19 in the field of cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence that emerged in the 1980s.
"Digital world has produced efficiencies, new innovative products, and close customer relationships globally by the effective use of mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), social media, analytics and cloud technology to generate models for better decisions. Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet."
In this article, we discuss the issues of GDPR's impact on cyber-security software and operations, namely automated information sharing. We illustrate the topic on an example of an intrusion detection alert sharing platform. First, we had to investigate the risks to privacy in the alert sharing platform and ensure its compliance with the GDPR's obligations. Second, fears and uncertainties emerged in the alert sharing community regarding the GDPR and its obligations and, thus, willingness to share the information was negatively impacted. We conducted DPIA to investigate risks related to information sharing in cyber security and dismiss doubts within the community. Although our results suggest that the risks are not high, we point out that the hype around GDPR caused substantial development of the sharing platform. The DPIA helped in a deeper understanding of risks and their management and is a solid argument for information sharing in cyber security under GDPR.
We present RoFICoM, a new retractable connection device that allows for mechanical, electric, and data communication connection between separable robotic modules. The device is intentionally designed to be used in lattice-type metamorphic robots, however, its applicability is much wider. The main novelty of our solution lies primarily in a new unique flat design and spatial compactness of the connector. With a flat connector, much more space is left for the body of a robotic module in the structure. Moreover, the connector is also fully self-contained device with well defined mechanical, electrical and data interfaces, hence it can be easily embedded in various robotic solutions. Our RoFICoM connector is easy to produce, it is open-hardware and free for non-commercial use. In the paper, we give construction details and report on a couple of experiments we performed to demonstrate key features of the connection achieved with two RoFICoM devices.
Pivoting is a technique used by cyber attackers to exploit the privileges of compromised hosts in order to reach their final target. Existing research on countering this menace is only effective for pivoting activities spanning within the internal network perimeter. When applying existing methods to include external traffic, the detection algorithm produces overwhelming entries, most of which unrelated to pivoting. We address this problem by identifying the major characteristics that are specific to potentially malicious pivoting. Our analysis combines human expertise with machine learning and is based on the inspection of real network traffic generated by a large organization. The final goal is the reduction of the unacceptable amounts of false positives generated by the state of the art methods. This paper paves the way for future researches aimed at countering the critical menace of illegitimate pivoting activities.
This paper is a digest of the thesis on predicting cyber attacks in a collaborative environment. While previous works mostly focused on predicting attacks as seen from a single observation point, we proposed taking advantage of collaboration and exchange of intrusion detection alerts among organizations and networks. Thus, we can observe the cyber attack on a large scale and predict the next action of an adversary and its target. The thesis follows the three levels of cyber situational awareness: perception, comprehension, and projection. In the perception phase, we discuss the improvements of intrusion detection systems that allow for sharing intrusion detection alerts and their correlation. In the comprehension phase, we employed data mining to discover frequent attack patterns. In the projection phase, we present the analytical framework for the predictive analysis of the alerts backed by data mining and contemporary data processing approaches. The results are shown from experimental evaluation in the security alert sharing platform SABU, where real-world alerts from Czech academic and commercial networks are shared. The thesis is accompanied by the implementation of the analytical framework and a dataset that provides a baseline for future work.
In this paper, we present AIDA, an analytical framework for processing intrusion detection alerts with a focus on alert correlation and predictive analytics. The framework contains components that filter, aggregate, and correlate the alerts, and predict future security events using the predictive rules distilled from historical records. The components are based on stream processing and use selected features of data mining (namely sequential rule mining) and complex event processing. The framework was deployed as an analytical component of an alert sharing platform, where alerts from intrusion detection systems, honeypots, and other data sources are exchanged among the community of peers. The deployment is briefly described and evaluated to illustrate the capabilities of the framework in practice. Further, the framework may be deployed locally for experimentations over datasets.
"Blacklists ( blocklists, denylists) of network entities (e.g., IP addresses, domain names) are popular approaches to preventing cyber attacks. However, the limited capacity of active network defense devices may not hold all the entries on a blacklist. In this paper, we evaluated two strategies to limit the size of a blacklist and their impact on the blacklist's accuracy. The first strategy is setting the maximal size of a blacklist; the second is setting an expiration time to blacklist items. Short-term attack predictions are typically more precise, and, thus, the recent blacklist entries should be more valuable than older ones. Our experiment shows that the blacklists reduced to half of the size via either strategy achieve only a 25 % drop in accuracy."
In the context of the global information age, cases concerning the provision of technical assistance to commit cybercrimes are growing in leaps and bounds and a brand-new crime-as-a-service industry is beginning to take shape. German criminal law addresses this issue in the context of joint commission theory and individual incrimination as complementary, whereas the Chinese model, by contrast, has made marked progress in the fight against cyber aiding by introducing new criminal provisions. The change of cyber-aiding indeed represents a significant challenge to current criminal legislation and consideration of its criminal countermeasures is indispensably significant.

"Security is a significant issue for everyone due to new and creative ways to commit cybercrime. The Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) systems are being installed in offices, houses, shopping malls, and on streets to protect lives. Operators monitor CCTV; however, it is difficult for a single person to monitor the actions of multiple people at one time. Consequently, there is a dire need for an automated monitoring system that detects a person with ammunition or any other harmful material Based on our research and findings of this study, we have designed a new Intelligent Ammunition Detection and Classification (IADC) system using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed system is designed to identify persons carrying weapons and ammunition using CCTV cameras. When weapons are identified, the cameras sound an alarm. In the proposed IADC system, CNN was used to detect firearms and ammunition. The CNN model which is a Deep Learning technique consists of neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery has gained popularity for unstructured (images, videos) data classification. Additionally, this system generates an early warning through detection of ammunition before conditions become critical. Hence the faster and earlier the prediction, the lower the response time, loses and potential victims. The proposed IADC system provides better results than earlier published models like VGGNet, OverFeat-1, OverFeat-2, and OverFeat-3."
Malware is 'malicious software' programs that carry out many of the cyberattacks on the Internet, including cybercrime, fraud, scams and nation-state cyberwar. These malicious software programs come in a wide range of different classifications such as viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, botnet malware, ransomware, Rootkit, etc. Ransomware is class of malware that holds the victim's data hostage by encrypting the data on a user's computer to make it unavailable to the user and only decrypt it after the user pays a ransom in the form of a sum of money. To avoid detection, different variants of ransomware utilise one or more techniques in their attack flow including Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. There is, therefore, a need to understand the techniques used ransomware development and their deployment strategy in order to understand their attack flow better to develop appropriate countermeasures. In this paper, we propose DNAact-Ran, A Digital DNA Sequencing Engine for Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning. DNAact-Ran utilises Digital DNA sequencing design constraints and k-mer frequency vector. To measure the efficacy of the proposed approach, we evaluated DNAact-Run on 582 ransomware and 942 goodware instances to measure the performance of precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy. Compared to other methods, the evaluation results show that DNAact-Run can predict and detect ransomware accurately and effectively.
There is an alarming increase in the number of cybercrime incidents through anonymous e-mails. The problem of e-mail authorship attribution is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of different writing style features on the classification accuracy. However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the evidence. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data mining method to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations of features that occurred frequently in the suspect's e-mails. This notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in many data mining applications, but it is the first time to be applied to the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike the traditional approach, the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting it in a court of law. Experiments on real-life e-mails suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify the author and the results are supported by a strong evidence. (c) 2008 Digital Forensic Research Workshop.

This Full Paper in the Innovative Practice category presents and evaluates a technical innovation for hands-on classes. When learning cybersecurity, operating systems, or networking, students perform practical tasks using a broad range of command-line tools. Collecting and analyzing data about the command usage can reveal valuable insights into how students progress and where they make mistakes. However, few learning environments support recording and inspecting command-line inputs, and setting up an efficient infrastructure for this purpose is challenging. To aid engineering and computing educators, we share the design and implementation of an open-source toolset for logging commands that students execute on Linux machines. Compared to basic solutions, such as shell history files, the toolset's novelty and added value are threefold. First, its configuration is automated so that it can be easily used in classes on different topics. Second, it collects metadata about the command execution, such as a timestamp, hostname, and IP address. Third, all data are instantly forwarded to central storage in a unified, semi-structured format. This enables automated processing of the data, both in real-time and post hoc, to enhance the instructors' understanding of student actions. The toolset works independently of the teaching content, the training network's topology, or the number of students working in parallel. We demonstrated the toolset's value in two learning environments at four training sessions. Over two semesters, 50 students played educational cybersecurity games using a Linux command-line interface. Each training session lasted approximately two hours, during which we recorded 4439 shell commands. The semiautomated data analysis revealed different solution patterns, used tools, and misconceptions of students. Our insights from creating the toolset and applying it in teaching practice are relevant for instructors, researchers, and developers of learning environments. We provide the software and data resulting from this work so that others can use them in their hands-on classes.
Cyber situation awareness has been recognized as a vital requirement for effective cyber defense. Cyber situation awareness allows cybersecurity operators to identify, understand, and anticipate incoming threats. Achieving and maintaining the cyber situation awareness is a challenging task given the continuous evolution of the computer networks, increasing volume and speeds of the data in a network, and rising number of threats to network security. Our work contributes to the continuous evolution of cyber situation awareness by the research of novel approaches to the perception and comprehension of a computer network. We concentrate our research efforts on the domain of IP flow network monitoring. We propose improvements to the IP flow monitoring techniques that enable the enhanced perception of a computer network. Further, we conduct detailed analyses of network traffic, which allows for an in-depth understanding of host behavior in a computer network. Last but not least, we propose a novel approach to IP flow network monitoring that enables real-time cyber situation awareness.
The resolution of lexical ambiguity in machine translation systems often involves the automated, on-line selection of the correct sense of polysemous target words in the context of a clause, phrase or sentence. However, the performance of machine translation systems in emulating this aspect of human language processing has not been entirely successful, to the extent that resolution of entities and terms in natural language could be automated for open source intelligence analysis. Whilst some of these systems confine themselves to processing domain-specific knowledge (e.g., medical terminology), with some success, the popular general-purpose direct translation systems now freely available on the World Wide Web (WWW) are investigated for characteristic semantic processing errors in this study. A ubiquitous sentence (The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog), an equative metaphor, and a simile are translated into four romance and one Germanic language, with the translation then inverted back to English using the same translation system. It is found that in addition to expected differences in correctly mapping shades of meaning (e.g., quick is mapped to fast), some spatial meanings are incorrectly transformed, especially for verbs (e.g., jumps over becomes branches over or jumps on). The most serious error is the addition of extra semantic features to individual words, particularly features associated with nouns (e.g., the gender-neutral fox becomes the female vixen). The implications of these types of errors for the automatic translation of human language - with respect to semantic representation in open source intelligence - are discussed.
A substantial amount of pornographic material is unregulated and readily accessible to all, which triggers cybercrime. Hence, the automatic detection and filtering of obscene content have become vital. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, a false-positive misclassification can affect the dignity of a person. So, we choose a detection algorithm that trains the model with annotated obscene images to specifically extract obscene features. We introduced a YOLOv3 ensemble learning method that integrates the sandglass block and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) into feature extraction. A diversified dataset is generated by using Pix-2-Pix GAN-based augmentation followed by extensive manual annotations to train this algorithm. The augmentation technique using illumination shifts and background color variations enables our model to reduce the misclassifications. The proposed design is optimized by using CFC3 loss, a combination of contrastive feature loss, and YOLOv3 default loss. We abbreviated this model as Ensemble learning with Attention-based YOLOv3 combined with CFC3 loss (EAYv3-CF}}C-3). EAYv3-CFC3 achieved an accuracy of 98.85 +/- 1.00%, a precision of 98.70 +/- 1.00%, a JI score of 97.73 +/- 1.00%, an FPR of 0.013 +/- 1.00%, an FM value of 98.85 +/- 1.00%, and MCC value of 97.70 +/- 1.30% with a better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have a tremendous potential to enhance individual, business, and government efficiency and improve general quality of life. However, the role of ICTs has brought with it numerous legal and regulatory challenges as well as an exacerbating criminal enterprise through cybercrime. Despite this, the evidence on the role of ICTs in improving the quality of life (QoL) is mixed and the exact nature of this relationship is not yet well understood especially at the global level. Existing information systems research has examined generally the effects of ICTs on the QoL at individual country level but there remains a gap in the understanding of the association between specific ICTs such as mobile penetration and QoL. In this study, we examine the effects of mobile penetration and QoL on one hand, and the mediating effects of ICT regulation on the other. We rely on the capability approach and archival data from 114 countries whilst employing Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling as the data analysis method. Our results show support for only the association of ICT regulation and QoL and prove that the mediating effects of ICT regulation is not significant. Our findings suggest that to enhance the QoL, practitioners and policymakers should emphasize ICT regulation to protect the privacy and security of individuals online to achieve the needed benefits. The study provides recommendations for future research.
"Most commercial Fraud Detection components of Internet banking systems use some kind of hybrid setup usually comprising a Rule-Base and an Artificial Neural Network. Such rule bases have been criticised for a lack of innovation in their approach to Knowledge Acquisition and maintenance. Furthermore, the systems are brittle; they have no way of knowing when a previously unseen set of fraud patterns is beyond their current knowledge. This limitation may have far reaching consequences in an online banking system. This paper presents a viable alternative to brittleness in Knowledge Based Systems; a potential milestone in the rapid detection of unique and novel fraud patterns in Internet banking. The experiments conducted with real online banking transaction log files suggest that Prudent based fraud detection may be a worthy alternative in online banking."
The Metaverse is a multi-user virtual world that combines physical reality with digital virtual reality. The three basic technologies for building the Metaverse are immersive technologies, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Companies are subsequently making significant investments into creating an artificially intelligent Metaverse, with the consequence that cybersecurity has become more crucial. As cybercrime increases exponentially, it is evident that a comprehensive study of Metaverse security based on artificial intelligence is lacking. A growing number of distributed denial-of-service attacks and theft of user identification information makes it necessary to conduct comprehensive and inclusive research in this field in order to identify the Metaverse's vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This article provides a summary of existing research on AI-based Metaverse cybersecurity and discusses relevant security challenges. Based on the results, the issue of user identification plays a very important role in the presented works, for which biometric methods are the most commonly used. While the use of biometric data is considered the safest method, due to their uniqueness, they are also susceptible to misuse. A cyber-situation management system based on artificial intelligence should be able to analyze data of any volume with the help of algorithms. To prepare researchers who will pursue this topic in the future, this article provides a comprehensive summary of research on cybersecurity in the Metaverse based on artificial intelligence.
In the current age of digital world, all users of Internet/Network as well as organizations are suffering from intrusions which results into data/information are theft/loss. In the present manuscript concept of intrusion detection system (IDS) were discussed along with its types and basic approaches. It is found that signature analysis, expert system, data mining etc. still using for IDS. Survey was given related to cybercrime incidents across various industry sectors. After analyzing the attacks on networks of organizations in different industry sectors it is found that still attacks like DDoS are not preventable. Comparison of data mining algorithms used for intrusion detection was also done. Various methods to implement the algorithm along with the advantages and disadvantages were also discussed in detail. Because of the disadvantages like over fitting, slow testing speed, unstable algorithms etc., intruders in the network are still active. To avert these shortcomings there is a need to develop real-time intrusion detection and prevention system through which data/information can be protected and saved in real-time basis before a severe loss is experienced. The real-time prevention is possible only if alerts are received instantly without delays. For this purpose, process mining could be used. This technique gives instant time alerts with real time analysis so as to prevent intrusions and data loss.
This article analyses the current state and directions of development of digital insurance as one of the branches of modern economy of the Russian Federation. Attention is paid to the increasing risks of cybercrime, the assessment of the amount of damage to such crimes is given, the protection of information data is considered. The most perspective branches of development of digital insurance are marked. At the same time, a view was expressed on the future of insurance as an autonomous industry. Risks are presented, including those related to the active creation of ecosystems by banks, which allow insurance operations to be carried out by banks' clients on their own, which, on the other hand, is a serious incentive for insurance development. The advantages of digital transformation and integration of insurance companies and services into the global digital ecosystem are described. Newchallenges that insurers may face in the transition to digital format are presented. Attention is paid not only to the need to make technological changes in insurance, but also to modernize relationships with customers. The potential of the Russian insurance market has been identified and tools for its implementation have been offered. There is a suggestion to expand the range of complex services provided. The main problems on the way of digital insurance development and possible steps for their solution have been identified.
"Information Technology and the Internet are ubiquitous tools for companies. Various companies are increasingly deploying information technologies to increase their process efficiency and to minimize costs. Information technologies have redefined the ways of conducting businesses. These technological revolutions have changed the nature of doing business on a global scale; simultaneously the threats surrounding these technologies are on rise. There have been various cases found in the aspects of information misuse, security attacks etc., which can be put together as cybercrime. There are different security tools like Authentication, Access Control, Anti-Virus, Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to enable organizations to control and mitigate information misuse and any threat surrounding the systems. However, they are effective in detecting outside threats, and often lack the ability to detect the insider threats (attacks undertaken by employees of the company). Insider threats have become one of the major information security challenges for the organizations. Traditional information security measures are focused on the threats from the outside environment rather than the internal environments. A wide range of research has been undertaken to investigate approaches to detect the insider threats. The study has identified packet based and flow based network analysis as the two popular approaches in detecting internal threats. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis, literature review and limitations on network traffic analysis approaches."
Live Forensics is the process of collecting forensically sound evidence from a running computer system. In cyber forensics, live forensics is very important which is to be done in order to collect volatile information. Live Forensics is done if the computer is in the running mode at the scene of crime because these information will be lost forever once the system is switched off. Also, this is the preferred option for forensically analyzing mission critical dedicated servers. During Live Forensics, it should be ensured that only relevant data is acquired from the Suspect's hard disk. This is done to minimize the tampering made in the Original Evidence. Browser files contain important information related to Suspects' Internet activities and hence its analysis is indispensable in both offline and live forensic analysis. Here, a framework which can do both the acquisition and analysis of Browser Files is discussed. The acquisition tool in the framework is capable of forensically retrieving the browser files from the Suspect's machine. The analysis tool analyzes the browser files acquired to find forensically relevant information related to Internet Activities. Browser Forensics of commonly used web browsers is described in the paper. This framework enables the investigators to find out crucial hints regarding the crime. This may help in proving whether the Internet activities related to the reported cybercrime had happened in the Suspect's machine.
"Cryptographic hashes such as MD5 and SHA-1 are used for many data mining and security applications - they are used as an identifier for files and documents. However, if a single byte of a file is changed, then cryptographic hashes result in a completely different hash value. It would be very useful to work with hashes which identify that files were similar based on their hash values. The security field has proposed similarity digests, and the data mining community has proposed locality sensitive hashes. Some proposals include the Nilsimsa hash (a locality sensitive hash), Ssdeep and Sdhash (both Ssdeep and Sdhash are similarity digests). Here, we describe a new locality sensitive hashing scheme the TLSH. We provide algorithms for evaluating and comparing hash values and provide a reference to its open source code. We do an empirical evaluation of publically available similarity digest schemes. The empirical evaluation highlights significant problems with previously proposed schemes; the TLSH scheme does not suffer from the flaws identified."
In light of the advancements in computing technology, and an increase in the use of mobile devices, various forms of services have emerged in recent times. Particularly, audiovisual (AV) content-based services that stream broadcasts through personal channels or self-produced video content shared with friends has been gaining ground. It is evolving into a new platform category to share information or help people express themselves. Meanwhile, there have been instances across the globe where these services have been used to stream or share illegal content. So far, few systematic technical studies have been conducted to investigate crimes associated with online services. In the process of viewing, sharing, and distributing illegal videos, digital artifacts may be saved on digital devices such as a PC or smartphone. This paper explores the client-side caches generated as a consequence of 'viewing' visible content through AV content-based services, including Dailymotion, Instagram, LINE, Snapchat, Telegram, TikTok, and YouTube, in various platforms including Windows, Android and iOS. Through analyzing caching mechanisms, this study categorizes and characterizes various AV caches observed during repeated experiments. This work also proposes algorithms (in combination with a developed open-source tool) for obtaining playable (visible) contents, by identifying and reassembling fragmented AV pieces.
The links between cybersecurity and civil protection in the last decades became strong due to the rapid increase in the use of Informatics Technologies (IT) worldwide and the need to increase citizens' protection from various disasters and uncertainties. The objective of the present study is to explore the role of cyber security in enhancing civil protection in Greek reality. Methodologically, the study has been based on a survey with a sample of 345 executives of IT companies in Greece by using a structured questionnaire. The basic results of the research study showed that cyber security technologies positively affect civil protection, cybercrime reduction practices have a positive influence on civil protection, and there is a significant relationship between the government's role in cyber security and civil protection. Cybersecurity also may have a significant influence on the principles of emergency operations: prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, or emergency evacuation and recovery. The main conclusion from the study is that it is very important for public and private agencies in Greece, as well as in the rest of Europe, to embrace new emerging cybersecurity technologies to help enhance cyber security and civil protection. Potential vulnerabilities in cybersecurity pose substantial risks to the effectiveness and efficiency of such critical infrastructure and directly impact the functioning of states, economies, and societies.
"The increased use of the Internet and the ease of access to online communities like social media have provided an avenue for cybercrimes. Cyberbullying, which is a kind of cybercrime, is defined as an aggressive, intentional action against a defenseless person by using the Internet, social media, or other electronic contents. Researchers have found that many of the bullying cases have tragically ended in suicides; hence automatic detection of cyberbullying has become important. The aim of this study is to detect cyberbullying on social media messages written in Turkish. To our knowledge, this is the first study which makes cyberbully detection on Turkish texts. We prepare a dataset from Instagram and Twitter messages written in Turkish and then we applied machine learning techniques that are Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision tree (C4.5), Naive Bayes Multinomial, and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers to detect cyberbullying. We also apply information gain and chi-square feature selection methods to improve the accuracy of classifiers. We observe that when both words and emoticons in the text messages are taken into account as features, cyberbully detection improves. Among the classifiers, Naive Bayes Multinomial is the most successful one in terms both classification accuracy and running time. When feature selection is applied classification accuracy improves up to 84% for the dataset used."
With the development of network technology, the Internet in China's economic construction and people's lives have achieved a wide range of applications, which makes people's work, study and life be undergone a qualitative change, the Internet has become the essential part of people's lives. However, with the rapid development of the Internet and information technology, and the network increase of the proportion of the population, there are network problems gradually revealed cybercrime highlights as a new type of crime, especially online economic crime can be described as intensified. Among them, network infringement of intellectual property-type crime, online banking crime network involved in a congregation-based economy the crime network securities crime, online shopping, and our revenue criminal crime of network economics harm the economic interests of the country and the people, and seriously affected the country economic order. We are moving in the right direction to make the country's economic order, it is necessary to understand and combat the crime of the network economy. Therefore, it becomes increasingly necessary for its research. The author hopes that the crime of network economic research discussed in this article, it is able to provide some ideas, looking for some governance measures in order to find effective prevention and containment the network economic crimes method, our network towards a better economic life, healthier goal.
Recently, malicious software are gaining exponential growth due to the innumerable obfuscations of extended x86 IA-32 (OPcodes) that are being employed to evade from traditional detection methods. In this paper, we design a novel distinguisher to separate malware from benign that combines Multivariate Logistic Regression model using kernel HS in Penalized Splines along with OPcode frequency feature selection technique for efficiently detecting obfuscated malware. The main advantage of our penalized splines based feature selection technique is its performance capability achieved through the efficient filtering and identification of the most important OPcodes used in the obfuscation of malware. This is demonstrated through our successful implementation and experimental results of our proposed model on large malware datasets. The presented approach is effective at identifying previously examined malware and non-malware to assist in reverse engineering.
Cybercrime investigations rely heavily on digital evidence to establish links between suspects and the criminal conduct they are allegedly involved in. As a result, digital evidence must be protected since it is complex, volatile, and susceptible to alteration. In the digital evidence method, the chain of custody (CoC) is essential. As a result of the CoC, it is possible to establish that the evidence was never tampered with. Due to the inherent uncertainty of digital evidence, the trustworthiness of the CoC cannot be judged at this time. It is the duty of forensic examiners to challenge this inclination and publicly admit the inherent ambiguity in whatever evidence they use to make their decisions. This article suggests a new paradigm for maintaining the integrity of digital evidence in order to overcome these challenges. To handle the uncertainty generated by error-prone technologies while dealing with CoC documents, the new paradigm used a fuzzy hash inside the blockchain data structure. Traditional hashing methods are only able to tell whether two inputs are precisely the same or not because they are sensitive to even the smallest input changes. Using fuzzy hash functions, we can figure out how dissimilar two images are by comparing their similarities. As an example of how this paradigm may be applied to computer systems and make digital investigations more successful, we utilize image forensics as the focus of an in-depth look at how it works.
Cybercriminals use different types of geographically distributed servers to run their operations such as C&C servers for managing their malware, exploit servers to distribute the malware, payment servers for monetization, and redirectors for anonymity. Identifying the server infrastructure used by a cybercrime operation is fundamental for defenders, as it enables take-downs that can disrupt the operation and is a critical step towards identifying the criminals behind it. In this paper, we propose a novel active probing approach for detecting malicious servers and compromised hosts that listen for (and react to) incoming network requests. Our approach sends probes to remote hosts and examines their responses, determining whether the remote hosts are malicious or not. It identifies different malicious server types as well as malware that listens for incoming traffic such as P2P bots. Compared with existing defenses, our active probing approach is fast, cheap, easy to deploy, and achieves Internet scale. We have implemented our active probing approach in a tool called CyberProbe. We have used CyberProbe to identify 151 malicious servers and 7,881 P2P bots through 24 localized and Internet-wide scans. Of those servers 75% are unknown to publicly available databases of malicious servers, indicating that CyberProbe can achieve up to 4 times better coverage than existing techniques. Our results reveal an important provider locality property: operations hosts an average of 3.2 servers on the same hosting provider to amortize the cost of setting up a relationship with the provider.
The rapid pace of technological developments in the area of information and communications technologies caused nations and peoples to be more reliant on cyber infrastructure to survive. Besides opportunities, the widespread use of information technology introduces new threats as well. Risks related to cyber security have started to threaten critical infrastructures, which are defined as assets that are essential for the functioning of a society and its economy. Cyber security has become one of the most serious national security concerns. In 2003 the United States was the first nation to prepare and publish a national cyber security strategy In the last ten years, 35 other nations have subsequently published their national cyber security strategy document. There are several aspects for national cyber security strategies. According to Luiijif and Healey (2012), there are five mandates of national cyber security: 1) Military cyber operations, 2) Counter cybercrime, 3) Intelligence/Counter intelligence, 4) Cyber security crisis management and critical infrastructure protection and 5) Internet governance and cyber diplomacy. In this study, the national cyber security strategies of France, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States and Turkey are examined and compared. Correlations between specific properties of the nation (economic power and political situation etc.) and focus and content of its cyber strategy were examined. The results of the study will provide guidance for nations that plan to prepare or update a national cyber security strategy.
The amount of data generated by the current interconnected world is immeasurable, and a large part of such data is publicly available, which means that it is accessible by any user, at any time, from anywhere in the Internet. In this respect, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a type of intelligence that actually benefits from that open nature by collecting, processing and correlating points of the whole cyberspace to generate knowledge. In fact, recent advances in technology are causing OSINT to currently evolve at a dizzying rate, providing innovative data-driven and AI-powered applications for politics, economy or society, but also offering new lines of action against cyberthreats and cybercrime. The paper at hand describes the current state of OSINT and makes a comprehensive review of the paradigm, focusing on the services and techniques enhancing the cybersecurity field. On the one hand, we analyze the strong points of this methodology and propose numerous ways to apply it to cybersecurity. On the other hand, we cover the limitations when adopting it. Considering there is a lot left to explore in this ample field, we also enumerate some open challenges to be addressed in the future. Additionally, we study the role of OSINT in the public sphere of governments, which constitute an ideal landscape to exploit open data.
"The complexity and diversity of banking risks has been on the rise in recent years due to increased competition between banks and the increasing number of financial products and services. Innovative banking financial services aimed at serving the population of the digitalized environment have caused major changes in online banking risks. The complex changes and regulations, as well as the increase in the volume of digital data, represent only a few of the factors that determine the change. As a result the associated risks are numerous. Bank risks in the digital environment are generated by fraudulent actions made on data, failures of the online banking system, cybercrime, cyber-terrorism, cyber-activism etc. These cyber threats lead to a variety of risks affecting the online banking system, such as: financial risks (R11 - R13); operational risks (R14); security risks (R15); fraud risks (R16); money-laundering risks (R17); reputational risks (R18); technological risks (R19). All these risk categories will be the subject of this paper. The code (R11-R21) will be used for easier identification during the paper. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to identify bank risks from another perspective for establishing a framework of risk variables for the machine-learning model that will be developed in future research. In this paper, the literature review was the central source to confirm our results."
Background: Youth mental health interventions aimed at reducing substance use and delinquency in adolescents compete with other types of interventions for reimbursement from public funding. Within the youth mental health domain, delinquent acts impose high costs on society. These costs should be included in economic evaluations conducted from a societal perspective. Although the relevance of these costs is recognized, they are often left out because the unit costs of delinquent acts are unknown. Aims of the Study: This study aims to provide a method for estimating the unit costs per perpetrator of 14 delinquent acts common in the Netherlands and included in self reported delinquency questionnaires: robbery/theft with violence, simple theft/pickpocketing, receiving stolen goods, destruction/vandalism of private or public property, disorderly conduct/discrimination, arson, cybercrime, simple and aggravated assault. threat. forced sexual contact, unauthorised driving, driving under the influence. dealing in soft drugs, and dealing in hard drugs. Methods: Information on government expenditures and the incidence of crimes, number of perpetrators, and the percentage of solved and reported crimes was obtained from the national database on crime and justice of the Research and Documentation Centre of the Ministry of Justice and Security, Statistics Netherlands, and the Council for the Judiciary in the Netherlands. We applied a top-down micro costing approach to calculate the point estimate of the unit costs for each of the delinquent acts and, subsequently. estimated the mean (SD) unit costs for each of the delinquent acts by taking random draws from a triangular distribution while taking into account a 10% uncertainty associated with the associated point estimate. Results: The mean (SD) unit costs per delinquent act per perpetrator ranged between (sic)495 ((sic)1.30) for Driving under the influence and (sic)33,813 ((sic)78.30) for a Cybercrime. These unit costs may be considered as outliers as most unit costs ranged between (sic)2,600 and (sic)13,500 per delinquent act per perpetrator. Discussion: This study is the first to estimate the unit costs per delinquent act per perpetrator in the Netherlands. The results of this study enable the inclusion of government expenditures associated with crime and justice in economic evaluations conducted from a societal perspective. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Youth mental health interventions aimed at reducing substance use and delinquency in adolescents are increasingly subjected to economic evaluations. These evaluations are used to inform decisions concerning the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and should cover all the costs and benefits for society, including those associated with delinquent acts. Implications for Health Policies: The results of this study facilitate economic evaluations of youth mental health interventions aimed at reducing substance use and delinquency in adolescents, conducted from a societal perspective. Implications for Further Research: Based on health-economic evaluations conducted in the field of youth mental health and the results of the current study, we recommend including the estimated unit costs in guidelines for health-economic evaluations conducted from a societal perspective. Future research could aim at examining whether these unit costs require regular updating. The methodology applied in this study allows for this.
The article deals with the problem of cybercrimes committed by young people and minors. The authors analyse the social portrait of juveniles committing cybercrimes, especially their personality and social status, with attention to details facilitating re-socialization. We consider the socio-demographic characteristics of minors who have committed crimes and were convicted with application of various penalties. It is concluded that there is no urgent need to reduce the age of criminal responsibility of minors. It is necessary to take into account, first of all, the psychological age, which reflects the level of development of the intellect and will, as well as the sociological age, which is responsible for the degree of socialization of the individual, and not the calendar age. Based on the analysis of court statistics and the results of the first nationwide study of the digital competence of adolescents and parents in the article it is shown that such components of digital competence as knowledge, skills, motivation and responsibility in different spheres of online activity (content, communication, technosphere, consumption) can be considered as factors that influence deviant behaviour of minors.
Over the last decades cybersecurity has become a cornerstone of European digital development. Alongside with the diffusion of information and communication technologies and the deepening (as well as widening) of the European Union, the initial narrow and sectoral data security policies have expanded into a comprehensive cybersecurity framework addressing issues from resilient infrastructure and technological sovereignty, through tackling cybercrime, to cyber defence capabilities and responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. In this complex web of interrelated policies a relative newcomer at the European Union (EU) level is cyber diplomacy. Sometimes also called public diplomacy 2.0, it factors into the cross-border connectivity of cyberspace and reflects a shift in international relations where the lines between external and internal policies, military and civilian domains are blurred. However, the term cyber diplomacy is fluid and it is not well understood which topics should be under its umbrella, in particular in relation to cybersecurity, where it seems to be linked the most. This article aims to map existing and proposed instruments that make up the EU's arsenal in this broad context to answer the following questions: what is cyber diplomacy and how is it related to the EU cybersecurity? Is cyber diplomacy in the EU becoming something in its own right as a distinct set of tools to secure the EU policy objectives?
An enormous growing of Information Technology and its applications in diverse fields enables us to think for digital world wherein cyberspace is being emerged significantly. After land, sea, air and space, cyberspace is the fifth domain where cybercrime, espionage and cyber weapons are on rising day by day. As a result, cyber security is a multi-dimensional concept and a complex issue straddling many disciplines and fields. Development of Information Technology makes possible to automate the industrial control system (ICS) for its efficient and remote operations. The automation in turn makes the industrial control system vulnerable to cyber security threats. Keeping in mind cyber security as a multi-dimensional complex issue, in this paper we have proposed a password policy for industrial control networks (ICNs) to have highest level of security. Our proposed password policy provides a set of guidelines for all involved individuals and associated systems in ICN and ICS ((IC)(NS)-N-2) with aim ensure security aspects such as authentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation and cyber security best practices in (IC)(NS)-N-2. The password policy covers password creation criteria, minimum required length of password and character sets for password composition. We have also discussed about the purpose, scope, policy exception, review and enforcement of the password policy in (IC)(NS)-N-2.
This study examined the Marlian's influence on social behavior among youths in Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. The study adopted the descriptive non-experimental survey design. The target population includes youth is some selected areas in Ado Ekiti consisting Iyin Road, Ejigbo, Oke-Iyinmi, Adebayo way and Post-office area. The choice of these areas is due to their population density of the youths. Thus, the total population consisted a total of 1,605 respondents among which a sample of 300 was randomly selected. Data collection involves the use of semi-structured questionnaire which was validated for inter-item consistencies using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.7% and above. Data analysis involved the use of the descriptive statistics such as the simple frequency counts and percentage distribution. Findings from the study shows that (51%) of the respondent strongly agreed that character and attitude of youths are usually influenced by the media and celebrity culture. The study further indicated that (51%) of the respondents strongly agree that Naira Marley lifestyle influence the usage of drugs among youths. The study concluded that youth now see cybercrime as a career choice and criminality among youth has been encouraged through Marlians behaviours. This study recommended that the Nigerian artists and celebrities should see themselves as role models to the younger generation and try their best to imbibe good moral values that young people can emulate.
Filtering is a fundamental strategy of metric similarity indexes to minimise the number of computed distances. Given a triplet of objects for which distances of two pairs are known, the lower and upper bounds on the third distance can be determined using the triangle inequality property. Obviously, tightness of the bounds is crucial for efficiency reasons - the more precise the estimation, the more distance computations can be avoided, and the more efficient the search is. We show that it is not necessary to consider arbitrary angles in triangles formed by pairwise distances of three objects, as specific range of possible angles is data dependent. When considering realistic ranges of angles, the bounds on distances can be much more tight and filtering much more effective. We formalise the problem of the data dependent estimation of bounds on distances and deeply analyse limited angles in triangles of distances. We justify the potential of the data dependent metric filtering both, analytically and experimentally, executing many distance estimations on several real-life datasets. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on the efficient search for the most similar bit strings to a given query in the Hamming space. The Hamming distance can be lower-bounded by the difference of the number of ones in the compared strings, i.e. of their weights. Recently, such property has been successfully used by the Hamming Weight Tree (HWT) indexing structure. We propose modifications of the bit strings that preserve pairwise Hamming distances but improve the tightness of these lower bounds, so the query evaluation with the HWT is several times faster. We also show that the unbalanced bit strings, recently reported to provide similar quality of search as the traditionally used balanced bit strings, can be more efficiently indexed with the HWT. Combined with the distance preserving modifications, the HWT query evaluation can be more than one order of magnitude faster than the HWT baseline.
Understanding online risk for adults with intellectual disabilities is important to improve digital inclusion in society. Perceptions of online risk can determine behaviours that obstruct or facilitate Internet access and use. This current study aimed to qualitatively investigate the psychological implications of online victimisation risks, including online negative comments and/or messages for adults with intellectual disabilities, as a novel area yet explored in-depth. Semi-structured interview data was collected remotely. Template analysis found there to be both negative and positive psychological implications experienced in response to online risks. Specifically, participants reported a wide range of negative emotions but also positive growth in the form of learning from the experience and increased confidence. The attribution of blame process in cybervictimisation can involve both blaming the perpetrator but also internalised victim-blaming which may be a consequence of the type of online risk (i.e. sexual risks). Implications for both practice and research are suggested.
States are not being held accountable for the vast majority of their harmful cyberoperations, largely because classifications created in physical space do not map well onto the cyber domain. Most injurious and invasive cyberoperations are not cybercrimes and do not constitute cyberwarfare, nor are states extending existing definitions of wrongful acts permitting countermeasures to cyberoperations (possibly to avoid creating precedent restricting their own activities). Absent an appropriate label, victim states have few effective and non-escalatory responsive options, and the harms associated with these incidents lie where they fall. This Article draws on tort law and international law principles to construct a comprehensive system of state accountability in cyberspace, where states are liable for their harmful acts and responsible for their wrongful ones. It identifies international cybertorts-acts that employ, infect, or undermine the internet, a computer system, or a network and thereby cause significant transboundary harm-as distinct from cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Not only does this term distinguish a specific kind of harmful act, it highlights how the principle of state liability for transboundary harms (which holds states accountable for the harmful consequences of both their lawful and unlawful activities) could usefully complement the existing law of state responsibility (which applies only to unlawful state acts). Imposing state liability for international cybertorts minimizes the likelihood that victim states will resort to escalatory responses, increases the chance that those harmed will be compensated, and preserves a bounded grey zone for state experimentation in cyberspace.
"Images are the things those are being used in day to day life so much that it has become an important aspect of everyone's life. Images have always been a popular thing to be instantly shared with each other around the globe. Today's world is a place where one can get easily influenced and images being perfect to influence as it easily conveys a lot using visual representation also it tends to be remembered more. Images can have positive influence via means of motivational quotes images also it can have negative influence via means of sharing nude images, images of killing etc. Retrieval of images with object-of-interest from a vast pool of social media images has been a research interest in the understanding of human emotions, situations leading to conflicts, in the field of cybercrime etc. The proposed system is a model for suspicious detection of an image; it is a system which will decide the image is a good or bad influence based on the past and present experiences. The proposed system makes use of more number of attributes than the existing system which makes prediction more accurate. It is a machine learning application where a large amount of data is analyzed and some meaningful information is extracted. The system makes use of the huge dataset of data given to it and that data being trained."
Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing technologies in the history of computing. It also changes the way of information technology to manage, access, provide and create services. Cloud computing also brings many benefits to end users and organizations. However, the rapid growth of cloud computing has made a new arena of crime called cybercrime. This poses new challenges in technical, legal and governance matters such as how to conduct appropriate digital investigations in the cloud environment and how to proactively collect data before incidents occur to save time, money and effort. This study aims to get the most ideal model/framework for forensics readiness on the cloud from previously published research. This paper discusses the literature study using a meta-analysis approach that applies social network analysis from 38 papers that discuss forensic readiness with its supporting factors. From the results of the study it is known that the ideal framework was proposed by Elyas 2014 with thirteen factors, which can be seen from the results of the calculation of social network analysis with the value betweenness centrality obtained value of 0.037 which shows the highest value of all the models previously studied. This value comes from a number of factors (after normalization) used by the model proposed by Elyas 2014 compared to other researchers.
While scales for the 'strength' of pornographic images have been developed and used in research and for judicial purposes, the potential emotive impact of text-based pornography has received little attention. In this paper we describe our approach to characterising dimensions of sexually explicit language and outline their use in strategies for neutralising such language. Our intended application of this work is contexts where we may wish to affect the content to which a student, trainee or other professional may be exposed. By controlling the quantity and degree of such content, we aim to minimise any detrimental effects (observer impact) that such content may have on ill-prepared individuals.
It is very important and difficult for remote monitoring and alarming in places such as Laboratory, Office, Residential Area and Hotels etc. This paper implemented a Remote Monitoring Alarming and Management System Based on Mobile Intelligent Terminal (RMAS-MIT), the remote monitoring and alarming system (RMAS) is composed of the front video collecting system, pre-processing system, data transmission system, data processing center. The data processing center will determine if there exists an abnormal event according to both the processed result from the collected video and the abnormal conditions set by the administrator. If an abnormal event appears, it will start the alarming work, for example, play alarm sound, send short message to the administrator's mobile, send email to the administrator etc. Aiming at the shortage of IPv4 address, this paper utilized both Port Map and Dynamic DNS technologies to implement the Dynamic Reverse Connection Trace (DRCT) to solve the remote management of RSMS-MIT located behind private networks. To implement the anywhere and anytime management of RSMS-MIT, this paper development the Mobile Intelligent Terminal based remote monitoring management system (RMAS-MIT).
Antifragility, which is an evolutionary understanding of resilience, has become a predominant concept in academic and industrial fields as the criticality of vital infrastructures (like healthcare and transportation) has become more flexible and varying due the impact of digitization and adverse circumstances, such as changing the prioritization of industrial services while accelerating IoT (Internet of Things) deployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The crucial role of antifragility is to enable critical infrastructures to gain from disorder to foster their adaptability to real unexpected environmental changes. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the antifragility concept while clarifying the difference with the resilience concept. Moreover, it highlights how the COVID-19 crisis has revealed the fragility of critical infrastructures and unintentionally promoted the antifragility concept. To showcase the main concepts, we adopt the blockchain as an example of an antifragile system.
In the modern world, the use of ICT communication technologies has become an integral part of life. ICT infrastructure is the bearer of digital traces of both legal and illegal activities performed through it. However, for something to become digital evidence, it must be obtained by law and by a person authorised by law. Namely, the virtual infrastructure, especially the Internet and the new challenges brought to us by cloud architectue due to its physical positioning outside national borders, calls into question the legality of searching and collecting digital evidence outside national borders. This paper analyses the legal basis for collecting digital evidence in cyberspace internationally, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the US Cloud Act, the Australian Decryption Act and the European GDPR. Although the Court of Justice of the European Union declared invalid the decision of the European Commission (EU) 2016/1250 on the adequacy of data protection provided through the EU-US Privacy Shield, experts must not stop looking for a solution to the apparent problem. The paper intends to support decision-makers in taking clear national positions regarding the above controversial legal norms and their mutual conflict. The paper compares the legal consequences of such collection, and the acceptability of such digital evidence, and such collection may also be associated with a breach of the privacy of a legal and private entity.
In recent years, security concerns, including document fraud and identity theft, terrorism, and cybercrime have led to the growth and development of biometric technologies, and in general, all activities related to biometric research have gained momentum. This research presents a more intelligent methodology for authenticating and verifying one's identity while reading and typing a text. Threats to e-commerce security are wreaking havoc on online trade via a variety of nefarious methods. Thus, this method can be implemented to furtively identify these attacks and impede them, using a variety of texts to study. We refer to the authentication as a behavioral biometric technology based on how people look when typing in which the visual information was implemented to verify the identity of 35 users while typing via using an eye tracker device. Hence, we have employed the two-layer perceptron neural network to model the learning phase in the object recognition process. The fusion of eye tracker device information and two-layer perceptron neural network coefficients was done at the decision level, and we have achieved an average of 98.97%, 98.76% and 98.86% for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively. By the combination of biometric technology products as well as modern computer technology, it is easy to perform monitoring, management, systems integration, automated management, and security applications.
"In 2016, law enforcement dismantled the infrastructure of the Avalanche bulletproof hosting service, the largest takedown of a cybercrime operation so far. The malware families supported by Avalanche use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to generate random domain names for controlling their botnets. The takedown proactively targets these presumably malicious domains; however, as coincidental collisions with legitimate domains are possible, investigators must first classify domains to prevent undesirable harm to website owners and botnet victims. The constraints of this real-world takedown (proactive decisions without access to malware activity, no bulk patterns and no active connections) mean that approaches from the state of the art cannot be applied. The problem of classifying thousands of registered DGA domain names therefore required an extensive, painstaking manual effort by law enforcement investigators. To significantly reduce this effort without compromising correctness, we develop a model that automates the classification. Through a synergetic approach, we achieve an accuracy of 97.6% with ground truth from the 2017 and 2018 Avalanche takedowns; for the 2019 takedown, this translates into a reduction of 76.9% in manual investigation effort. Furthermore, we interpret the model to provide investigators with insights into how benign and malicious domains differ in behavior, which features and data sources are most important, and how the model can be applied according to the practical requirements of a real-world takedown."
This paper presents a study on the application of supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of distinguishing and categorizing Virtual Private Network (VPN) and The Onion Router (TOR) traffic on the dark web. The dark web, characterized by its anonymity and inaccessibility, has become a popular platform for illicit activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and cybercrime. While VPNs and TOR can be used for legitimate purposes such as privacy protection and bypassing internet censorship, they can also be exploited by cybercriminals. The CIC-Darknet2020 dataset, which includes a comprehensive collection of network traffic captures from the dark web incorporating traffic features from both VPN and TOR technologies, is used for this study. We employ classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers to construct our model. The performance of the model is evaluated using parameters such as execution time, accuracy, precision, F-measure, and recall, utilizing five-fold and ten-fold cross-validation and 66/34 and 80/20 percentage splits. Our results show that the Decision Tree (J48) classifier outperforms other classifiers, achieving 99.6% accuracy with an execution time of 15 seconds for ten-fold cross-validation. The findings of this study have implications for enhancing cybersecurity measures in identifying and mitigating threats associated with VPN and TOR traffic on the dark web.
The COVID-19 pandemic introduced the new norm that changed the way we work and live. During these unprecedented times, most of the organizations expected their employees to work from home. Remote working created new opportunities for hackers since more users were making use of digital platforms for online shopping, accessing Virtual Private Network (VPN), videoconferencing platforms, and software alike. Consequently, cybercrime increased due to the increase in the attack surface, and software vulnerabilities were exploited for launching cyberattacks. There is existing research that explores vulnerability disclosure on Twitter. However, there is a lack of study on opportunistic targeted attacks where specific vulnerabilities are exploited in a way that benefit adversaries the most in times such as COVID-19. The primary aim of this work is to study the effectiveness of vulnerability disclosure pattern on Twitter in COVID-19, and discuss how Twitter can be leveraged as Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) during a pandemic where the global users can follow a coordinated approach to share security-related information and conduct awareness campaigns. The study identifies Twitter as an apt source for conducting cybersecurity awareness campaigns as 99.83% of the security vulnerabilities are found to be accurate. The information can help global cybersecurity agencies to proactively identify vulnerabilities, coordinate activities, and plan for mitigation strategies since releasing patches from the vendor might take time.
This paper seeks to examine the notion of piracy cultures and their effects upon the field of education and in particular education at a university level. Whilst there is no doubt that the advances of technological developments have brought about many advancements in society, none more so than in the realms of information and communication technologies (ICTs) it is also true that their capabilities can be put to, perhaps, more nefarious uses. The idea of cybercrime is well documented (e. g. Wall 2007, Brenner 2010) however there is increasing concern over the ways in which ICTs are facilitating a shift in perception towards a tacit acceptance or even in some cases a proud promulgation of lesser misdemeanors. One of the less talked about spin offs of piracy culture in its broadest sense is the loss of integrity of information which has led to an increase in appropriation of content and more specifically to plagiarism in the educational world. Piracy cultures are blamed for a surge in plagiarism and other 'offences'. Is this perception true? The authors argue that there is growing evidence that points to a need for a re-conceptualization of what is and what is not allowed in terms of data sharing. Our concept of education is augmented by the potentialities that information and communication technologies (ICTs) enable.
Machine learning techniques are being widely used to develop an intrusion detection system (IDS) for detecting and classifying cyberattacks at the network-level and the host-level in a timely and automatic manner. However, many challenges arise since malicious attacks are continually changing and are occurring in very large volumes requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model, is explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and unpredictable cyberattacks. The continuous change in network behavior and rapid evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future cyberattacks. A comprehensive evaluation of experiments of DNNs and other classical machine learning classifiers are shown on various publicly available benchmark malware datasets. The optimal network parameters and network topologies for DNNs are chosen through the following hyperparameter selection methods with KDDCup 99 dataset. All the experiments of DNNs are run till 1,000 epochs with the learning rate varying in the range [0.01-0.5]. The DNN model which performed well on KDDCup 99 is applied on other datasets, such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto, WSN-DS, and CICIDS 2017, to conduct the benchmark. Our DNN model learns the abstract and high-dimensional feature representation of the IDS data by passing them into many hidden layers. Through a rigorous experimental testing, it is confirmed that DNNs perform well in comparison with the classical machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose a highly scalable and hybrid DNNs framework called scale-hybrid-IDS-AlertNet which can be used in real-time to effectively monitor the network traffic and host-level events to proactively alert possible cyberattacks.
Many techniques have emerged to evaluate software Technical Debt (TD). However, differences in reporting TD are not yet studied widely, as they can give different perceptions about the evolution of TD in projects. The goal of this paper is to compare three TD identification techniques: i. Maintainability Index (MI), ii. SIG TD models and iii. SQALE analysis. Considering 17 large open source Python libraries, we compare TD measurements time series in terms of trends in different sets of releases (major, minor, micro). While all methods report generally growing trends of TD over time, MI, SIG TD, and SQALE all report different patterns of TD evolution.
The previous two decades have given birth to a new popular phenomenon - online social networking. Its range, diversity and constantly growing impact on our lives provides space for the creation of new and profitable, highly professionalized industry of cybercrime. It is based on phishing, social engineering, brute force password guessing or malware collecting passwords. The aim is to penetrate another's account and monetize it by blackmailing, searching for cryptocurrency wallets, obtaining passwords, influencing public opinion in favor of an idea, or at least sending spam. Today's hackers are well organized into massive, internally specialized criminal networks recruited from the best IT specialists, and as the latest results of the British investigative initiative Bellingcat show, they are also often the cornerstone of the ongoing hybrid war. On top of this, in February 2021, the mother of all breaches appeared on the darknet - the COMB database consisting of 3.2 billion of unique pairs of emails and cleartext passwords. This is a clear and present danger for every user of any social network and their providers have to act immediately to protect accounts of their users. This paper describes how a social network operator with 250,000 daily active users deals with the problem of account compromise by deploying anomaly detection responsive to sudden changes in the behavior of a user trying to log in to the account.
Relevance. The study is relevance due to the problem of cybercrime, including corruption-related crimes, which were caused by the rapid worldwide development of computer technology, as well as the widespread use of cyberspace networks and the digitization of information-sharing processes in society. The object of the study is the public relations that arise in the process of judicial expertise in the investigation of corruption-related crimes committed in cyberspace. Several research methods have been used in the writing of this research article. The dialectical method was the first and foremost method in the study of judicial expertise. The method of analysis, the synthesis method, and comparison method were used during the research process. Research results. The authors of this scientific article came to the conclusion that the specific nature of the use of forensic investigations in the investigation of corruption offenses committed in cyberspace is one of the main forms of use of specialized knowledge in criminal proceedings and the result of which is the conclusion of expert opinion, which is the source of evidence in criminal proceedings. In addition, it was noted that all the issues that are solved by the examination of telecommunication systems (equipment) and tools have a diagnostic nature, and a list of typical issues should be fixed in the appropriate instructions.
Ransomware can prevent a user from accessing a device and its files until a ransom is paid to the attacker, most frequently in Bitcoin. With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals, and the public. However, a more comprehensive, evidence-based picture on the global direct financial impact of ransomware attacks is still missing. In this article, we present a data-driven method for identifying and gathering information on Bitcoin transactions related to illicit activity based on footprints left on the public Bitcoin blockchain. We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source platform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35 ransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of each ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for ransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12 768 536 (22 967.54 BTC). We also find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players responsible for the majority of the payments. Based on these research findings, policy-makers and law enforcement agencies can use the statistics provided to understand the size of the illicit market and make informed decisions on how best to address the threat.
ACID transactions have proven to be a very useful mechanism of ensuring reliability of applications. Guaranteeing transactional properties effectively and correctly is a challenging task by itself. Furthermore, investigating transaction issues in a distributed environment is at least equally complex and requires systematic data collection and analysis. In this paper, we present mechanisms and concepts of distributed tracing with focus on the OpenTracing API and showcase our integration of tracing capabilities into the Narayana transaction manager. We show that the performance impact of tracing does not drastically decrease user application performance while providing useful information for the analysis of running transactions.
The last decade has meant a whole revolution in the context of Internet of Things (IoT), becoming one of the most important areas of research nowadays. The Semantic Web emerged as a way to add semantics to data to enable advanced reasoning. Due to this, the integration of both areas represents a beneficial convergence for more semantic-aware devices and services. In this paper we present a review to analyze the state of the art of the confluence of the Semantic Web and IoT: extracting an overview of the ad-hoc implemented tools, their categorization, and the supported sub-domains on which they exert their influence.
Smart Grids represent an important instance of cyberphysical systems for the energy sector. Due to the many layers involved and the complexities of interrelations, co-simulations have emerged as a way to integrate results from different simulators. In this paper, we propose a study of the possibilities of simulating node failure scenarios with a modification of the Mosaik co-simulation platform to allow for dynamic topologies changes. We show how co-simulations can help in determining the impact of different failure patterns using a sample scenario of households and PV units.
There is an increasing public and policy awareness that tracking cookies are being used to support behavioral advertising, but the extent to which tracking is occurring is not clear. The extent of tracking could have implications for the enforceability of legislative responses to the sharing of personal data, including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). In this paper, we develop a methodology for determining the prevalence of tracking cookies, and report the results for a sample of the 501 most visited sites by Australians. We find that the use of tracking cookies is endemic, but that distinct clusters of tracking can be identified across categories including search, pornography and social networking. The implications of the work in relation to privacy are discussed.
Web search engines provide easy access to a wealth of open access information but depend for their optimal use upon careful selection of search terms in order to return a high proportion of relevant information. Generally, this implies a clear association between the meaning of the chosen search expression and the information needs of the searcher. In contrast, this paper considers a scenario in which the searcher may wish to retrieve information without making their information requirements transparent. We argue that careful choice of search strategy can also facilitate retrieval of relevant information in a covert fashion that conceals the searcher's intention by ensuring return of a majority of irrelevant search hits.
Manufacturing production heavily depends on the processes that need to be followed during manufacturing. As there might be many reasons behind possible deviations from these processes, the deviations can also cover ongoing insider attacks, e.g., intended to perform sabotage or espionage on these infrastructures. Insider attacks can cause tremendous damage to a manufacturing company because an insider knows how to act inconspicuously, making insider attacks very hard to detect. In this paper, we examine the potential of process-mining methods for insider-attack detection in the context of manufacturing, which is a new and promising application context for process-aware methods. To this end, we present five manufacturing-related scenarios of insider threats identified in cooperation with a manufacturing company, where the process mining could be most helpful in the detection of their respective attack events. We describe these scenarios and demonstrate the utilization of process mining in this context, creating ground for further future research.
New devices in smart grid such as smart meters and sensors have emerged to become a massive and complex network, where a large volume of data is flowing to the smart grid systems. Those data can be real-time, fast-moving, and originated from a vast variety of terminal devices. However, the big smart grid data also bring various data quality problems, which may cause the delayed, inaccurate analysis of results, even fatal errors in the smart grid system. This paper, therefore, identifies a comprehensive taxonomy of typical data quality problems in the smart grid. Based on the adaptation of established data quality research and frameworks, this paper proposes a new data quality management framework that classifies the typical data quality problems into related data quality dimensions, contexts, as well as countermeasures. Based on this framework, this paper not only provides a systematic overview of data quality in the smart grid domain, but also offers practical guidance to improve data quality in smart grids such as which data quality dimensions are critical and which data quality problems can be addressed in which context.
"Despite the efforts of anti-doping agencies to control doping in sport, the use of performance enhancing substances (PES) and methods remains an intractable issue. Potentially heightening the problem is the emergence of the darknet which provides an anonymous online method for obtaining PES. Despite numerous investigations of PES availability via the regular internet, there is currently little understanding of their availability on the darknet. The aim of this study was to conduct a descriptive analysis of the availability, quantity, cost, and forms of substances included in the 2021 WADA International Standard Prohibited List that are for sale within darknet markets within a 12-week period. A search of substances that are included on the prohibited list was conducted across various darknet trading locations. The search revealed multiple anabolic agents; peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances, and mimetics; hormone and metabolic modulators; and diuretic and masking agents available for purchase on the darknet. The search also revealed the costs, the form (pills, injectables, gels), and available quantities of PES. Given the breadth of products available, it was concluded that the procurement of PES via the darknet presents anti-doping agencies with a novel and challenging problem. Anti-doping agencies and law enforcement could develop strategies to monitor darknet activities and consult cybercrime experts as a part of their toolkit for enforcing anti-doping behaviours. Further research investigating darknet activity of athletes and support personnel is required."
With the growth of mobile computing techniques, mobile gambling scams have seen a rampant increase in the recent past. In mobile gambling scams, miscreants deliver scamming messages via mobile instant messaging, host scam gambling platforms on mobile apps, and adopt mobile payment channels. To date, there is little quantitative knowledge about how this trending cybercrime operates, despite causing daily fraud losses estimated at more than $522,262 USD. This paper presents the first empirical study based on groundtruth data of mobile gambling scams, associated with 1,461 scam incident reports and 1,487 gambling scam apps, spanning from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of this ground-truth data allows us to characterize the operational pipeline and full fraud kill chain of mobile gambling scams. In particular, we study the social engineering tricks used by scammers and reveal their effectiveness. Our work provides a systematic analysis of 1,068 confirmed Android and 419 iOS scam apps, including their development frameworks, declared permissions, compatibility, and backend network infrastructure. Perhaps surprisingly, our study unveils that public online app generators have been abused to develop gambling scam apps. Our analysis reveals several payment channels (ab)used by gambling scam app and uncovers a new type of money mule-based payment channel with the average daily gambling deposit of $400,000 USD. Our findings enable a better understanding of the mobile gambling scam ecosystem, and suggest potential avenues to disrupt these scam activities.
In recent years, the proliferation of fake accounts on social media has become a significant concern for individuals, organizations, and society. Fake accounts play an important role in spreading fake news, rumors, spam, unethical harassment, and other mischievous motives on social media platforms. Detecting such accounts manually is time-consuming and challenging, especially with the increasing sophistication of the methods used to create them. Therefore, there is a need for automated approaches to detect these fake accounts. This article aims to reveal fake accounts and their role on social media platforms. This article has explored various methodologies to detect fake accounts from social platforms, which will help prevent cybercrime. We have also proposed a generalized deep learning (DL) model to detect such accounts on social media using multimodal data. The proposed architecture uses a combination of textual, visual, and network-based features to capture the various characteristics of fake accounts. Specifically, we use a deep neural network that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual data, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for textual data, and convolutional graph networks (GCNs) for network-based data. We evaluated our model on a publicly available dataset of Twitter accounts and achieved state-of-the-art performance in detecting fake accounts, with an F1 score of 0.96. We also conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of each feature and the combination of the three features.
Technology is rapidly advancing and every aspect of life is being digitalized. Since technology has made life much better and easier, so organizations, such as businesses, industries, companies and educational institutes, etc., are using it. Despite the many benefits of technology, several risks and serious threats, called cyberattacks, are associated with it. The method of neutralizing these cyberattacks is known as cybersecurity. Sometimes, there are uncertainties in recognizing a cyberattack and nullifying its effects using righteous cybersecurity. For that reason, this article introduces interval-valued complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations (IVCIFRs). For the first time in the theory of fuzzy sets, we investigated the relationships among different types of cybersecurity and the sources of cyberattacks. Moreover, the Hasse diagram for the interval-valued complex intuitionistic partial order set and relation is defined. The concepts of the Hasse diagram are used to inspect different cybersecurity techniques and practices. Then, using the properties of Hasse diagrams, the most beneficial technique is identified. Furthermore, the best possible selection of types of cybersecurity is made after putting some restrictions on the selection. Lastly, the advantages of the proposed methods are illuminated through comparison tests.
Nowadays, VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork) has gained increasing attention from many researchers with its various applications, such as enhancing traffic safety by collecting and disseminating traffic event information. This increased interest in VANET has necessitated greater scrutiny of machine learning (ML) methods used for improving the security capabilities of intrusion detection systems (IDSs), such as the need to solve computationally intensive ML problems due to the increased vehicular data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid ML model to enhance the performance of IDSs by dealing with the explosive growth in computing power and the need for detecting malicious incidents timely. The proposed approach mainly uses the advantages of Random Forest to detect known network intrusions. Besides, there is a post-detection phase to detect possible novel intruders by using the advantages of coresets and clustering algorithms. Our approach is evaluated over a very recent IDS dataset named CICIDS2017. The preliminary results show that the proposed hybrid model can increase the utility of IDSs. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Credit/debit cards are a ubiquitous form of payment at present. They offer a number of advantages over cash, including convenience, security, and fraud protection. In contrast, the inherent vulnerabilities of credit/debit cards and transaction methods have led many payment institutions to focus on strengthening the security of these electronic payment methods. Also, the increasing number of electronic payment transactions around the world have led to a corresponding increase in the amount of money lost due to fraud and cybercrime. This loss of money has a significant impact on businesses and consumers, and it necessitates the development of rigid and robust security designs for securing underlying electronic transaction methods. In this regard, this research introduces a novel geolocation-based multi-factor authentication method for improving the security of electronic payment transactions, especially ATM transactions. The proposed method leverages geolocation to verify the user's identity and prevent fraudulent transactions. In addition, this research also proposes a novel design approach for further controlling the ownership of transactions in a convenient way (e.g., allowing users to deactivate/reactivate authentication at any time, block the card in case it is stolen or lost, and set up a withdrawal limit). Overall, this approach does not require any major modifications to the existing banking infrastructure, which would be an ideal solution for securing ATM transactions around the world.
The world is facing a cybersecurity skills gap as cybercrime and cyberwarfare grow in importance. One often-discussed quality that is potentially relevant to cybersecurity recruitment and education is the so-called security mindset: a way of thinking characteristic of some security professionals that they believe to be especially advantageous in their work. Although some employers express a desire to hire people with a security mindset, and initiatives to cultivate the security mindset are being implemented, it has no common definition and little is known about its characteristics, its development, and its consequences. We interviewed 21 cybersecurity professionals who strongly identified as having a security mindset based on a minimal description drawn from existing literature. Thematic analysis of the interview data suggests that the security mindset can be conceptualized as consisting of three interconnected aspects-monitoring for potential security anomalies, investigating anomalies more deeply to identify security flaws, and evaluating the relevance of those flaws in a larger context. These three aspects develop in different ways and have different personal and professional consequences. Participants mostly spoke positively of the security mindset, but they also mentioned several disadvantages not mentioned by existing security-mindset literature, such as mental health pressures, workplace tensions, and negative effects on personal relationships. We discuss the implications of these findings for future study of the security mindset and suggest practical implications for cybersecurity management, education, and recruitment.
With society becoming increasingly digital, new opportunities are afforded to potential offenders to weaponize digital features and affordances to carry out their crimes. As a result, concerns persist over online forms of crime, particularly cybercrime involving sexual exploitation, and what can be done about them. Drawing on interview and focus group data collected from 70 sex crime investigators from police service organizations across Canada, we uncover police perspectives on online sex-based crime. We demonstrate that police perceive online crimes to not necessarily be new forms of crime, but rather altered by digital media in terms of methods and weapons being used. We focus on uncovering the features and affordances police identify as contributing to the increase in crime itself as well as the creation of greater opportunities for crime to occur. In addition, resulting from crime shifting into digital spaces, we uncover the challenges digital media has presented for police in terms of how they handle, respond to, and investigate online crime. We discuss these challenges and their impact on policing and provide solutions for combatting them moving forward. Overall, this article contributes to the current body of literature investigating online crime and policing in the digital age by drawing on the theoretical framework of affordances and offering police perspectives on online sex-based crimes.
The emergence of synthetic media such as deep fakes is considered to be a disruptive technology shaping the fight against cybercrime as well as enabling political disinformation. Deep faked material exploits humans' interpersonal trust and is usually applied where technical solutions of deep fake authentication are not in place, unknown, or unaffordable. Improving the individual's ability to recognise deep fakes where they are not perfectly produced requires training and the incorporation of deep fake-based attacks into social engineering resilience training. Individualised or tailored approaches as part of cybersecurity awareness campaigns are superior to a one-size-fits-all approach, and need to identify persons in particular need for improvement. Research conducted in phishing simulations reported that persons with educational and/or professional background in information technology frequently underperform in social engineering simulations. In this study, we propose a method and metric to detect overconfident individuals in regards to deep fake recognition. The proposed overconfidence score flags individuals overestimating their performance and thus posing a previously unconsidered cybersecurity risk. In this study, and in line with comparable research from phishing simulations, individuals with IT background were particularly prone to overconfidence. We argue that this data-driven approach to identifying persons at risk enables educators to provide a more targeted education, evoke insight into own judgement deficiencies, and help to avoid the self-selection bias typical for voluntary participation.
ln the last few years, the high acceptability of service computing delivered over the internet has exponentially created immense security challenges for the services providers. Cyber criminals are using advanced malware such as polymorphic botnets for participating in our everyday online activities and trying to access the desired information in terms of personal details, credit card numbers and banking credentials. Polymorphic botnet attack is one of the biggest attacks in the history of cybercrime and currently, millions of computers are infected by the botnet clients over the world. Botnet attack is an intelligent and highly coordinated distributed attack which consists of a large number of bots that generates big volumes of spamming e-mails and launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the victim machines in a heterogeneous network environment. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the malicious bots and prevent their planned attacks in the cloud environment. A number of techniques have been developed for detecting the malicious bots in a network in the past literature. This paper recognize the ineffectiveness exhibited by the singnature based detection technique and networktraffic based detection such as NetFlow or traffic flow detection and Anomaly based detection. We proposed a real time malware detection methodology based on Domain Generation Algorithm. It increasesthe throughput in terms of early detection of malicious bots and high accuracy of identifying the suspicious behavior.
"The Internet and social networks are increasingly becoming a media of extremist propaganda. On homepages, in forums or chats, extremists spread their ideologies and world views, which are often contrary to the basic liberal democratic values of the European Union. It is not uncommon that violence is used against those of different faiths, those who think differently, and members of social minorities. This paper presents a set of instruments and tools developed to help investigators to better address hybrid security threats, i.e., threats that combine physical and cyber attacks. These tools have been designed and developed to support security authorities in identifying extremist propaganda on the Internet and classifying it in terms of its degree of danger. This concerns both extremist content on freely accessible Internet pages and content in closed chats. We illustrate the functionalities of the tools through an example related to radicalisation detection; the data used here are just a few tweets, emails propaganda, and darknet posts. This work was supported by the EU granted PREVISION (Prediction and Visual Intelligence for Security Intelligence) project."
The online romance scam is a cybercrime that has resulted in substantial impact on victims, both psychologically and financially. The display of a personal advertisement by scammers on online dating websites in the form of the user profile is often the first step in the scam strategy to attract potential victims. This study examined differences in the use of language in self- and desired partner-description found in both the scammer profiles and a set of general user profiles on online dating websites. Using a corpus-based methodology, 500 user profiles identified as having fraudulent characteristics were compared with the same number of user profiles downloaded from five popular dating portals. Words that are statistically different in their frequencies of occurrence in the two sets of data were generated using a corpus analysis software and then categorized based on semantic and contextual criteria. The analysis uncovered linguistic features that are distinctive of the scammer profiles, revealing strategies used by online scammers in constructing and engaging a certain type of victim, by intensively invoking love, romance and commitment, and conjuring hope of a future as a couple through pertinent use of lexical and function words. Implications of the study include its contribution to the understanding and identification of the linguistic indicators of romance fraud user profiles which are important in efforts to raise public awareness and for future development of computerized scam detection tools.
Purpose As emphasised by the theory of knowledge-based view, knowledge constitutes the basic element for a firm's competitive advantage. Consequently, a firm's knowledge at risk could have an adverse effect on its performance. In this regard, this paper aims to investigate potential knowledge risks present in an (ICT)-supported collaborative project and establishes inter- and multi-relationships among these risks. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, an integrated approach using the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) technique and MICMAC analysis is implemented to determine the hierarchical inter-relationships among knowledge risks and classify them according to their driving and dependence power. Findings The result reveals seven knowledge risks. The analysis establishes cybercrime and espionage as high drivers of knowledge risks in an ICT-supported collaborative project. Further, a comprehensive model is developed showing the hierarchical structure and multi- and inter-relationships among the analysed risks. Practical implications From a practical viewpoint, the proposed model in this study will be of great importance to practitioners because it highlights the most prominent knowledge risks in an ICT-supported collaborative project. Additionally, it will provide a clue for effective knowledge risk management in a systematic approach. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first studies to use both the TISM technique and MICMAC analysis to identify and classify knowledge risks in an ICT-supported collaborative project.
Due to the advancement of technology, cybercrime has increased considerably, making digital forensics essential for any organisation. One of the most critical challenges is to analyse and classify the information on devices, identifying the relevant and valuable data for a specific purpose. This phase of the forensic process is one of the most complex and time-consuming, and requires expert analysts to avoid overlooking data relevant to the investigation. Although tools exist today that can automate this process, they will depend on how tightly their parameters are tuned to the case study, and many lack support for complex scenarios where language barriers play an important role. Recent advances in machine learning allow the creation of new architectures to significantly increase the performance of information analysis and perform the intelligent search process automatically, reducing analysis time and identifying relationships between files based on initial parameters. In this paper, we present a bibliographic review of artificial intelligence algorithms that allow an exhaustive analysis of multimedia information contained in removable devices in a forensic process, using natural language processing and natural language understanding techniques for the automatic classification of documents in seized devices. Finally, some of the open challenges technology developers face when generating tools that use artificial intelligence techniques to analyse the information contained in documents on seized devices are reviewed.
"With the significant growth of internet usage, people increasingly share their personal information online. As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker's types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system. Furthermore, some precautionary countermeasures are investigated, and new strategies are suggested."
A significant negative impact of spam e-mail is not limited only to the serious waste of resources, time, and efforts, but also increases communications overload and cybercrime. Perhaps the most damaging aspect of spam email is that it has become such a major tool for attacks of cross-site scripting, malware infection, phishing, and cross-site request forgery, etc. Due to the nature of the adaptive unsolicited spam, it has been weakening the effect of the previous discovery techniques. This article proposes a new Spam Detection System (SDS) framework, by using a series of six different variants of enhanced Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (EGOAs), which are investigated and combined with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for the purpose of advanced spam email detection. In this context, the combination of MLP and EGOAs produces Neural Network (NN) models, referred to (EGOAMLPs). The main idea of this research is to use EGOAs to train the MLP to classify the emails as spam and non-spam. These models are applied to SpamBase, SpamAssassin, and UK-2011 Webspam benchmark datasets. In this way, the effectiveness of our models on detecting diverse forms of spam email is evidenced. The results showed that the proposed MLP model trained by EGOAs achieves a higher performance compared to other optimization methods in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and false alarm rate.
Recently, it reported that the cases of cybercrime had increased by about 13% in 2017, especially in data fraud crime, due to the poor security system. One of the solutions to this problem is by implementing a biometric system as a security platform. Biometric is a method of personal ID authentication by using human recognition using unique human biometric values such as fingerprint, voice, face, or iris. This review paper focused on the iris biometric system since Iris biometric widely used as a system for maintaining data security, such as ATM, cellular phone, etc. Moreover, the biometric has very high sensitivity and accuracy for recognition than the other. In this paper, we will review some experiments of iris recognition that was done by researchers. As a result, we will present some comparisons among several studies, including in feature extraction technique, performance, and time computation required on the matching process. From the paper review, we can analyze that a good result of iris recognition depends on the selection of the right features and the needed time computation. The use of Haar Wavelet (texture analysis) with three different iris databases showed the best performance, such as MMU (ACC = 96.44%, time = 0.34s), UTIRIS (ACC = 96.21%, time = 0.68s), and IITD (ACC = 97.14%, time = 0.64s).
Digital forensics is a rapidly growing and emerging field, which is considered as a part of information/computer security. Nowadays, the expansion of cybercrime incidents and criminal acts are becoming oppressive and the proper education and training in the digital forensic area are becoming very important due to the increasing demand for the professionals in this field. The study presented in the paper is a contribution to the educational game design advancement by providing the participants empirical experience close to the real life environment. The positive correlation between the gaming and the test scores points out that gaming during learning positively stimulates the development of the essential skills, know-hows and abilities, such as problem solving, strategic thinking, memory, fantasy, interaction and adaptation to the learning focus, which are elements well captured by the standardized checks in particular subjects. The goal of the obtained research was also to find out whether the learning attributes acknowledged in the upgraded taxonomy can be applied within a game designing process, as their usability was studied only in the assessment of already existing and popular significant games. The in-built in game learnability properties are based on the lately enhanced taxonomy game used for assessment and evaluation of educational results. The course design of the game is described and the learnability properties are estimated through survey and the observation of the participants.
As cybercrime is on the rise, individuals would like to rest assured that their authentication information cannot be stolen, and then used to gain access to their privileged information. Smart cards can and have played a pivotal role in lowering the statistics on identity theft. This has been achieved by predominantly implementing biometrics matching algorithms inside smart card technology. The biometric matching inside a smart card is known as Match-on-Card/On-Card comparison. However compared to traditional biometric systems implemented on PCs' and servers, smart cards are resource constrained. In addition smart cards do not implement mathematical functions such as trigonometry since they are mainly meant for secure data storage and simple processing. The current state of the On-Card biometric comparison technology is limited in that data for On-Card comparison either has to be pre-calculated outside the card at runtime or fetched from a look-up table. This is because of the limited mathematical operations available inside a smart card. The pre-calculation of data outside the smart card compromises the security offered by the card and the look-up table limits the accuracy of the biometric comparison. The paper reviews the techniques and challenges of implementing fingerprint On-Card comparison algorithms in a smart card environment. Approaches of overcoming the On-Card comparison challenges are also discussed.
Quality improvement of practical cybersecurity training is challenging due to the process-oriented nature of this learning domain. Event logs provide only a sparse preview of trainees' behavior in a form that is difficult to analyze. Process mining has great potential in converting events into behavioral graphs that could provide better cognitive features for understanding users' behavior than the raw data. However, practical usability for learning analytics is affected by many aspects. This paper aims to provide an experience report summarizing key features and obstacles in integrating process discovery into cyber ranges. We describe our lessons learned from applying process mining techniques to data captured in a cyber range, which we have been developing and operating for almost ten years. We discuss lessons learned from the whole workflow that covers data preprocessing, data mapping, and the utilization of process models for the post-training analysis of Capture the Flag games. Tactics addressing scalability are explicitly discussed because scalability has proven to be a challenging task. Interactive data mapping and Capture the Flag specific features are used to address this issue.
In our digital era, insider attacks are among the serious underresearched areas of the cybersecurity landscape. A significant type of insider attack is facilitated by employees without malicious intent. They are called unintentional perpetrators. We proposed mitigating these threats using a simulation-game platform to detect the potential attack vectors. This paper introduces and implements a scenario that demonstrates the usability of this approach in a case study. This work also helps to understand players' behavior when they are not told upfront that they will be a target of social engineering attacks. Furthermore, we provide relevant acquired observations for future research.
This demo paper presents a dashboard for network security management, a web application that visualizes data gathered by various sensors in the network and allows the user to achieve cyber situational awareness and provides decision support in the incident handling process. The dashboard and its underlying database use modern graph-based approaches to data modelling, storing, and querying. The dashboard speeds up routine tasks in incident handling, such as getting a context of a situation and quickly assessing the spread and impact of vulnerabilities. The implementation uses modern graph-based approaches to data storage and visualization.
Analyzing network traffic is one of the fundamental tasks in both network operations and security incident analysis. Despite the immense efforts in workflow automation, an ample portion of the work still relies on manual data exploration and analytical insights by domain specialists. Current state-of-the-art network analysis tools provide high flexibility at the expense of usability and have a steep learning curve. Recent-often web-based-analytical tools emphasize interactive visualizations and provide simple user interfaces but only limited analytical support. This paper describes the tool that supports the analytical work of network and security operators. We introduce typical user tasks and requirements. We also present the filtering funnel metaphor for exploring packet capture (PCAP) files through visualizations of linked filter steps. We have created PCAPFunnel, a novel tool that improves the user experience and speeds up packet capture data analysis. The tool provides an overview of the communication, intuitive data filtering, and details of individual network nodes and connections between them. The qualitative usability study with nine domain experts confirmed the usability and usefulness of our approach for the initial data exploration in a wide range of tasks and usage scenarios, from educational purposes to exploratory network data analysis.
Nowadays, a growing need for the forensic investigation of cybercrimes emerges. It is because of the rising threat of those crimes in cyberspace. Nevertheless, such investigations are highly time-consuming with delicate supportive processes. The problem of systematic preparation on the potential forensic investigation during the software development process, called forensic readiness, has only been explored since recently. Therefore there are still many open issues and challenges, with missing methods and guidelines that would support software engineers in building software systems that are forensic ready. One of the essential open challenges is the understanding of the forensic-readiness requirements that shall be embedded in the software system early during its design, and then also the techniques to ensure and verify forensic readiness and its specific needs along the way. In this paper, we propose a research roadmap towards verification of forensic readiness in software design and development, to help the progress of this new research domain. The results of the research based on the roadmap can then support software engineers in designing critical, forensic-ready systems, together with possible perspective methods of capturing and verifying the specific requirements constituting forensic readiness.
This article presents an overview of the growth of internet piracy in the global marketplace. The ethical perceptions (or lack of) of the younger generation is addressed, in terms of their willingness to consume counterfeit goods on the web. Firms face the task of educating the consumer that downloading music, software, movies and the like, without compensation, is unethical. This awareness is critical for decreasing the demand for counterfeit goods in the virtual marketplace, where a consumer can exhibit a rogue behaviour with a limited fear of prosecution. We address the pyramid of internet piracy, which encompasses sophisticated suppliers/facilitators, such as the Warez group. Recent sting operations, such as Operation Buccaneer, are also depicted to highlight successful tactical manoeuvres of enforcement agencies. An overview of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the No Electronic Theft Act is included to debate the controversy surrounding this legislation. A discussion of enterprise enforcement mechanisms and novel anti-piracy technology for cyberspace is provided to reveal some of the tools used to fight the pirates, such as innovations in digital watermarking and NEC's recently announced video content identification technology. Enterprise information systems and its interdependence on the internet are also demanding new technologies that enable internet investigators to rapidly search, verify and potentially remove pirated content using web services. The quality of service of web services designed to efficiently detect pirated content is a growing consideration for new anti-piracy technology.
Socialization has changed the behavior of physical objects in IoT (Internet of Things) by introducing the SIoT (Social Internet of Things) paradigm to emulate the social behavior of humans in a connected cyber-physical world. To create reliable social networking in IoT, trust management has been used to build social relationships autonomously and facilitate trustworthy information sharing among physical objects. Although trust management is being highlighted as a promising security mechanism, the understanding of its potential across various SIoT application domains is so far limited. Thus, in this paper, we examine the social aspects of trust management in the Internet of Things and their role in supporting the evolution of IoT towards SIoT. To this end, we examine existing work in various SIoT application domains in distinct environments to understand how trust management socializes smart objects among each domain, with the Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks, and Flying Ad-hoc Networks being identified as the most popular domains, together with the Internet of Medical Things as a specific SIoT domain with raising interest by the scientific community and need of trustworthy interactions between patients and things. Finally, we highlight the future research directions that can be considered to improve the applicability of trust management in SIoT and reinforce the socialization of smart IoT objects in the digital ecosystems of the future.
The energy domain is part of Critical Infrastructures (CI), in which Smart Grids (SG) play the role of major enabler of concepts such as Smart Cities. The capability of reasoning through ontologies is of paramount importance to allow a better integration of sensors and devices part of the smart energy domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of semantic reasoning in the energy domain, by evaluating the performance of ten ontologies in terms of different metrics such as load time and run-time performance, discussing how such ontologies can be applicable in case of deployment on devices with constrained resources.
"Nowadays, the web provides all of the nation's daily necessities, and time spent online is rising quickly. The Internet is being used more widely than ever. As a result, cyberattacks and cybercrime are becoming more prevalent. Various machine learning techniques will be used to rec-ognize network attacks and defend against cyber security threats. Developing intrusion detection systems can improve cybersecurity and identify anomalies on a computer server. An efficient intru-sion detection and prevention system will be created using machine learning techniques. Each intru-sion detection categorization system evaluated in this study has its unique uses. The Firefly Optimization (FFO) technique was used to detect the intrusions before the categorization proce-dure was carried out using a machine learning classifier. It considered how the anomalies in net-works were categorized in this research. The outcomes of the detection techniques will be validated using the Knowledge Discovery Dataset (KDD-CUP 99). The proposed method involves Probabilistic Neural Network for the categorization. The implementation will assess many perfor-mance metrics for various cyber-attack types, including specificity, recall, F1-score, accuracy, pre-cision, and sensitivity. The proposed technique achieves a high accuracy of 98.99%.& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on behalf of Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

Phishing is a fraudulent technique used by attackers known as phishers for obtaining credentials (username and passwords) of a specific or group of users on internet. Phishing came into focus in 1996, and from then it is emerging out as one of the biggest cybercrime attacks on internet. The solutions for handling phishing attacks include: detecting the activity and filtering it from normal activity (Phished Email and Website detection), preventing it by the use of excellent user interfaces and login authentication schemes and user training so that users can prevent themselves from being falling into it. Researchers have focused on all the three techniques for solving phishing attacks. However the previous techniques handle the problem of phishing to an extent but are incomplete, and complex to implement or use in actuality. The research work in this paper will be focused on the critical review of previous schemes proposed, with a novel scheme for preventing phishing attacks with the use of four characters secret information display during login authentication. The novelty of the scheme lies in its low complexity, better user understandability and real time implementation ability. This paper also describes the analyzed results of a real time experiment done to evaluate the scheme. Our results show great improvement with a total of only 13.5%, 1% and 3% user's phished in rigorous phishing attempts, of various kinds for a period of one month.
Both the academy and industry believe that Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) would be achievable in one decade since modern vehicle and communication technologies advanced apace. Vehicular Communication System (VCS) introduces information technology to the ITS and aims to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. In recent year, security and privacy schemes in VCS are becoming important. However, recovery mechanisms to eliminate the negative effect of security and privacy attacks are still an important topic for research. Therefore, the certificate revocation scheme is considered as a feasible technique to prevent the system from potential attacks. The major challenge of the certificate revocation scheme is to achieve low-cost operation since the communication resources must be capable of carrying various applications apart from the security and privacy purposes. In this paper, we propose an efficient certificate revocation scheme in VCS. The Blockchain concept is introduced to simplify the network structure and distributed maintenance of the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). The proposed scheme embeds part of the certificate revocation functions within the security and privacy applications, aiming to reduce the communication overhead and shorten the processing time cost. Extensive simulations and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme, in which the Blockchain structure costs fewer network resources and gives a more economic solution to against further cybercrime attacks.

When searching for a brand name in search engines, it is very likely to come across websites that sell fake brand's products. In this paper, we study how to tackle and measure this problem automatically. Our solution consists of a pipeline with two learning stages. We first detect the ecommerce websites (including shopbots) present in the list of search results and then discriminate between legitimate and fake ecommerce websites. We identify suitable learning features for each stage and show through a prototype system termed RI.SI.CO. that this approach is feasible, fast, and highly effective. Experimenting with one goods sector, we found that RI.SI.CO. achieved better classification accuracy than that of non-expert humans. We next show that the information extracted by our method can be used to generate sector-level 'counterfeiting charts' that allow us to analyze and compare the counterfeit risk associated with different brands in a same sector. We also show that the risk of coming across counterfeit websites is affected by the particular web search engine and type of search query used by shoppers. Our research offers new insights and some very practical and useful means for analyzing and measuring counterfeit ecommerce websites in search-engine results, thus enabling targeted anti-counterfeiting actions.
Networking, operating systems, and cybersecurity skills are exercised best in an authentic environment. Students work with real systems and tools in a lab environment and complete assigned tasks. Since all students typically receive the same assignment, they can consult their approach and progress with an instructor, a tutoring system, or their peers. They may also search for information on the Internet. Having the same assignment for all students in class is standard practice efficient for learning and developing skills. However, it is prone to cheating when used in a summative assessment such as graded homework, a mid-term test, or a final exam. Students can easily share and submit correct answers without completing the assignment. In this paper, we discuss methods for automatic problem generation for hands-on tasks completed in a computer lab environment. Using this approach, each student receives personalized tasks. We developed software for generating and submitting these personalized tasks and conducted a case study. The software was used for creating and grading a homework assignment in an introductory security course enrolled by 207 students. The software revealed seven cases of suspicious submissions, which may constitute cheating. In addition, students and instructors welcomed the personalized assignments. Instructors commented that this approach scales well for large classes. Students rarely encountered issues while running their personalized lab environment. Finally, we have released the open-source software to enable other educators to use it in their courses and learning environments.
"The article analyses the economic aspects of establishing the practice of remote client identification by Russian credit institutions. Developing such practices is necessitated by the permanent digitization of the interaction between subjects of banking relations. The article presents the results of an analysis of the economic aspects of remote client identification by banks in developed and developing countries (Austria, Great Britain, India, China, USA, Sweden, Switzerland, and South Korea). The research reveals the theoretical and practical peculiarities of the banking biometric identification system currently functioning in Russia. On the basis of this analysis, the author identifies economic reasons for the lack of motivation of most Russian banks to develop new practices. For the first time in Russian economic literature, the key problems that impede remote client identification have been discussed systematically, including: a) risk of unauthorized access to the central database; b) concerns about privacy violations; c) lack of free access to materials on software testing, guarantees of developer companies, operators, etc.; d) risk of unauthorized access to the UBS by outsiders successfully using identification procedures; e) exposure to financial risks from unauthorized access to the UBS, transferred to clients; f) unsatisfactory results of combating banking cybercrime in Russia. The author advances several robust proposals to overcome these problems and minimize the economic risks of applying remote client identification systems in Russia, taking into account the positive and negative experiences of foreign countries."
Cybercrime can be associated with undisclosed social media accounts deliberately used to conduct unethical or illegal activities such as cyberbullying, fraudulent transactions, human trafficking, etc. The objective of this paper is to identify whether two social media accounts belong to the same person by examining the accounts' writing, i.e. comments and posts. To that end, this preliminary study introduces a new algorithm, ChunkedHCs, specifically designed for the authorship verification task to decide whether a pair of texts are written by the same person. In the domain of machine learning and deep learning, there have been previous authorship verification approaches, which often involve complex feature selections or sophisticated pre-processing steps due to the complexity of topic heterogeneity. Such limits provide motivations to seek a simpler yet more robust approach that could offer competitive verification ability. ChunkedHCs is based on the statistical testing Higher Criticism (Donoho and Jin, 2004) and the HC-based similarity algorithm (Kipnis, 2020a & 2020b) (Kestemont et al., 2020). Using Reddit users' data, ChunkedHCs offer a promising performance with an accuracy of 0.94 and an F1 of 0.9381 for texts between 29,000 and 30,000 characters. It is speculated that the algorithm could also be highly applicable to identify if two accounts are used by the same person for other social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and even dark web forums. Various avenues of further research on ChunkedHCs are also proposed. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
The emergence of a large number of new malicious code poses a serious threat to network security, and most of them are derivative versions of existing malicious code. The classification of malicious code is helpful to analyze the evolutionary trend of malicious code families and trace the source of cybercrime. The existing methods of malware classification emphasize the depth of the neural network, which has the problems of a long training time and large computational cost. In this work, we propose the shallow neural network-based malware classifier (SNNMAC), a malware classification model based on shallow neural networks and static analysis. Our approach bridges the gap between precise but slow methods and fast but less precise methods in existing works. For each sample, we first generate n-grams from their opcode sequences of the binary file with a decompiler. An improved n-gram algorithm based on control transfer instructions is designed to reduce the n-gram dataset. Then, the SNNMAC exploits a shallow neural network, replacing the full connection layer and softmax with the average pooling layer and hierarchical softmax, to learn from the dataset and perform classification. We perform experiments on the Microsoft malware dataset. The evaluation result shows that the SNNMAC outperforms most of the related works with 99.21% classification precision and reduces the training time by more than half when compared with the methods using DNN (Deep Neural Networks).
Cryptography or message hiding techniques can be a solution to avoid cybercrime. One of the techniques is Playfair Cipher that is a cryptographic algorithm. It can hide messages by forming a message key in the form of a 5x5 square-shaped key matrix to accommodate 25 capital letter characters by removing the letter J and replacing it with the letter I and making plaintext messages into letter pairs (bigram) to do the encryption process with some rules and provisions in this algorithm. So that a ciphertext is formed which has the same character length as the plaintext. The Playfair Cipher algorithm mechanism is the weakness of Playfair Cipher, which is the limitation in accommodating characters. Eliminate the letter J that causes ambiguity and the length of the plaintext character and the same ciphertext so that it is easy to solve with the frequency of occurrence of the bigram. Modifying Playfair cipher algorithm by extending into 5x19 key matrix with ninety-five characters to hold any types of characters (capital letters, small, numbers, symbols) solving the ambiguity. The expansion techniques will form different ciphertext results with its plaintext to overcome the weakness of Playfair cipher. The aim of this research was to produce a Playfair cipher modification algorithm that could cover the weakness of Playfair cipher and result in differences in character length on plaintext and ciphertext implementation results from Playfair cipher modification.
This paper provides a survey of prediction, and forecasting methods used in cyber security. Four main tasks are discussed first, attack projection and intention recognition, in which there is a need to predict the next move or the intentions of the attacker, intrusion prediction, in which there is a need to predict upcoming cyber attacks, and network security situation forecasting, in which we project cybersecurity situation in the whole network. Methods and approaches for addressing these tasks often share the theoretical background and are often complementary. In this survey, both methods based on discrete models, such as attack graphs, Bayesian networks, and Markov models, and continuous models, such as time series and grey models, are surveyed, compared, and contrasted. We further discuss machine learning and data mining approaches, that have gained a lot of attention recently and appears promising for such a constantly changing environment, which is cyber security. The survey also focuses on the practical usability of the methods and problems related to their evaluation.
Capture the Flag challenges are a popular form of cybersecurity education, where students solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting. The tasks feature diverse assignments, such as exploiting websites, cracking passwords, and breaching unsecured networks. However, it is unclear how the skills practiced by these challenges match formal cybersecurity curricula defined by security experts. We explain the significance of Capture the Flag challenges in cybersecurity training and analyze their 15,963 textual solutions collected since 2012. Based on keywords in the solutions, we map them to well-established ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines to understand which skills the challenges teach. We study the distribution of cybersecurity topics, their variance in different challenge formats, and their development over the past years. The analysis showed the prominence of technical knowledge about cryptography and network security, but human aspects, such as social engineering and cybersecurity awareness, are neglected. We discuss the implications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our results indicate that future Capture the Flag challenges should include non-technical aspects to address the current advanced cyber threats and attract a broader audience to cybersecurity.

The anonymous system Tor uses an asymmetric algorithm to protect the content of communications, allowing criminals to conceal their identities and hide their tracks. This malicious usage brings serious security threats to public security and social stability. Statistical analysis of traffic flows can effectively identify and classify Tor flow. However, few features can be extracted from Tor traffic, which have a weak representational ability, making it challenging to combat cybercrime in real-time effectively. Extracting and utilizing more accurate features is the key point to improving the real-time detection performance of Tor traffic. In this paper, we design an efficient and real-time identification scheme for Tor traffic based on the time window method and bidirectional statistical characteristics. In this paper, we divide the network traffic by sliding the time window and then calculate the relative entropy of the flows in the time window to identify Tor traffic. We adopt a sequential pattern mining method to extract bidirectional statistical features and classify the application types in the Tor traffic. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on the UNB public dataset (ISCXTor2016) to validate our proposal's effectiveness and real-time property. The experiment results show that the proposed method can detect Tor flow and classify Tor flow types with an accuracy of 93.5% and 91%, respectively, and the speed of processing and classifying a single flow is 0.05 s, which is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.
Multi-purpose Messaging Mobile App (MMMA) combines several functionalities in a single APP to provide integrated service that brings tremendous convenience to users. Therefore, MMMAs become more and more popular. However, the prevalence of MMMAs also makes them a hotbed for cybercrime. Among them, Click Farming fraud requires special attention, as it causes substantial pecuniary losses and is challenging to detect. In this paper, we describe Multi-view Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (MHT-GNN), a framework for detecting Click Farming fraudsters in a popular MMMA called WeChat. We first adopt a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph (HTG) to model spatial, heterogeneous and temporal information contained in MM-MA data. We then extract two different types of user history sequences as two views of user behavior patterns from HTG. MHT-GNN contains a pretraining phase and a detection phase. The main components in MHT-GNN include Inductive Heterogeneous GNN Encoder, Temporal Snapshot Sequence Encoder, and User Relation Sequence Encoder. The first encoder aims to capture spatial information and the heterogeneity in each snapshot of HTG. The later two encoders are designed to incorporate temporal information to better reveal user's behavior patterns and MHT-GNN leverages them to capture the two different views of user history behavior data. We conduct experiments on a real-world, million-scale dynamic graph extracted from WeChat. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MHT-GNN: it significantly exceeds existing detection methods, and it is able to block Click Farming fraud activities.
Complex Big Data systems in modern organisations are progressively becoming attack targets by existing and emerging threat agents. Elaborate and specialised attacks will increasingly be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses. With the ever-increasing trend of cybercrime and incidents due to these vulnerabilities, effective vulnerability management is imperative for modern organisations regardless of their size. However, organisations struggle to manage the sheer volume of vulnerabilities discovered on their networks. Moreover, vulnerability management tends to be more reactive in practice. Rigorous statistical models, simulating anticipated volume and dependence of vulnerability disclosures, will undoubtedly provide important insights to organisations and help them become more proactive in the management of cyber risks. By leveraging the rich yet complex historical vulnerability data, our proposed novel and rigorous framework has enabled this new capability. By utilising this sound framework, we initiated an important study on not only handling persistent volatilities in the data but also further unveiling multivariate dependence structure amongst different vulnerability risks. In sharp contrast to the existing studies on univariate time series, we consider the more general multivariate case striving to capture their intriguing relationships. Through our extensive empirical studies using the real world vulnerability data, we have shown that a composite model can effectively capture and preserve long-term dependency between different vulnerability and exploit disclosures. In addition, the paper paves the way for further study on the stochastic perspective of vulnerability proliferation towards building more accurate measures for better cyber risk management as a whole.
The fundamental changes in fight against crime policy by choosing forensic science as a strategic tool in this fight are currently undergoing in European Union (EU). Hence, every Member State has specific system of forensic science institutions, the unique conception of forensic science and different legal systems as well. Meanwhile, the vision for European Forensic Science 2020 is one page length abstract document, providing only the guidelines for creation of European Forensic Science Area and including a list of areas (terrorism, cybercrime, etc.) covered, but not prescribing any implementation measures. Acting in accordance with the project The Conception of Implementation of vision for European Forensic Science 2020 in Lithuania (EUROVIFOR) funded by Research Council of Lithuania, the authors have accomplished analysis of scientific literature and legal regulations governing the application of special knowledge indifferent countries representing different schools of forensic science: Germanic (Germany, Austria), Roman (France), the Anglo-Saxons (Great Britain), Eastern Europe (Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Ukraine, Russia, Belarus). This paper presents the results of abovementioned analysis showing the need of harmonization of legal regulations, the main directions of such a harmonization, its positive potential in promoting cooperation of law enforcement authorities across EU and some other problems in forensic science sector to be solved in order European Forensic Science Area would be created by 2020. This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP089/2014) of the Research Council of Lithuania.
Botnets, the groups of illegally controlled infected devices on the Internet have had a history of two decades already. This history shows an evolution of the infection techniques, the scope of the target devices, and their usage. Thus, the new direction is the usage of sophisticated data leakage techniques by state-sponsored hacker groups. Our article analyses this evolution while focusing on Botnet usage for cyber espionage. We present the Botnet architecture in the context of network science research, lifecycle, applied network protocols, and capabilities. Next, we analyze two examples, the APT28 group activities and the VPNFilter Botnet, which demonstrate the real-life cyber espionage capability of this technique.
Phishing is an online fraud that deceives visitors by impersonating a legitimate website to steal their confidential or personal information. This is a well-known form of cybercrime. With the aim of detecting phishing sites, several phishing site detection techniques have recently been created. However, it fails to achieve the desired goal and has a large number of drawbacks, including low accuracy, long learning curve, and low-power embedded hardware. For covering such drawbacks, this work proposes an efficient URLs Phishing detection technique. Our technique depends on Software Defined Network (SDN) technology, clustering and feature method, and Conventional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. Feature selection technique is based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The SDN is used to transfer the URLs phishing detection process out of the user's hardware to the controller layer, continuously train on new data, and then send its outcomes to the SDN-Switches. RFE-SVM and CNN are used to increase accuracy of phishing detection. Therefore, the proposal model does not require retrieving the content of the target website or using any third-party services. It captures the information and sequential patterns of URL strings without requiring a prior knowledge about phishing, and then uses the sequential pattern features to quickly classify the actual URL. The experimental results showed that our proposal highlighted the robustness and accuracy in distinguishing between phishing and legitimate sites. Our suggestion achieves 99.5% phishing detection accuracy.
The paper observes a method of generating the original crypto currency based on the well-established blockchain technology coupled with a new approach of unrelated third-party payments receipt and double-layer encryption for security reasons. At the first stage, the scholars studied and reviewed blockchain operating principles for using them in the crypto currency being developed. The researchers chose an optimal method of encrypting the transmitted data based on the irredundant SHA-256 algorithm that answered the required encryption complexity. The authors used the Proofof-work method for cybercrime defences and block verification. The next step for the scholars was to develop and test a distributed database for storing information about coins, users, keys, transactions made and being processed. This database includes MySQL database management system, which has an application programming interface API and connectors for numerous programming languages, a library for NET platform languages. Double-layer encryption was added to the resulting system in order to improve data crypto reliability (soundness). Specialized applications for generating user keys and validating operations were actualized. 6000 coins were generated for that purpose. Finally, a graphical web-interface was designed for users' work with coins in PHP scripting programming language, simulations were performed, and all maintained processes were tested. The presented stages allow the developers to introduce their own crypto currencies with various additional features, which can be limited only by their own imagination and technological means, and can be launched on the cryptomarket.
The widespread adoption of data-driven applications in critical infrastructures has arisen with security and privacy concerns. Blockchain has received considerable attention to protect critical infrastructures (e.g., healthcare and transportation) that could be subjected to intentional and unintentional cyberattacks. Blockchain patterns as reusable solutions have been used in critical infrastructure software to fulfill security requirements while delivering reliable and trusted services to citizens. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive review of blockchain patterns to examine how they can steer the advancement of critical infrastructures. Through a critical analysis of existing blockchain pattern literature, we identify realistic limitations, lessons learned and open research issues entirely dedicated to advancing blockchain-based antifragile critical infrastructures.
The world is facing an energy crisis. The smart building concept is presented by many researchers using IoT devices that do not have sufficient computational power to compute the data to decide about the results. According to an estimation, there will be 50 billion IoT devices in 2020. Most IoT devices send data to the cloud for processing. Latency and network usage will be increased in cloud servers because the cloud servers will not be able to handle millions of requests spontaneously. In this paper, we have proposed a framework that minimizes latency and energy consumption in cloud computing. The proposed framework uses edge computing and most of the processing is performed on fog nodes. The framework contributes significantly to energy saving by supporting behavioral and physical changes in the cloud network.
The Smart Grid (SG) is nowadays an essential part of modern society, providing two-way energy flow and smart services between providers and customers. The main drawback is the SG complexity, with an SG composed of multiple layers, with devices and components that have to communicate, integrate, and cooperate as a unified system. Such complexity brings challenges for ensuring proper reliability, resilience, availability, integration, and security of the overall infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a new smart grid testing management platform (herein called SGTMP) for executing real-time hardware-in-the-loop SG tests and experiments that can simplify the testing process in the context of interconnected SG devices. We discuss the context of usage, the system architecture, the interactive web-based interface, the provided API, and the integration with co-simulations frameworks to provide virtualized environments for testing. Furthermore, we present one main scenario about the stress-testing of SG devices that can showcase the applicability of the platform.
For years, attackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Previous research has examined target selection in cybercrime, but there has been little investigation into the factors that influence target selection in attacks on IoT. This study aims to better understand how attackers choose their targets by analyzing the frequency of specific exploits in 11,893 IoT malware binaries that were distributed between 2018-2021. Our findings indicate that 78% of these binary files did not specifically target IoT vulnerabilities but rather scanned the Internet for devices with weak authentication. To understand the usage of exploits in the remaining 2,629 binaries, we develop a theoretical model from relevant literature to examine the impact of four latent variables, i.e. exposure, vulnerability, exploitability, and patchability. We collect indicators to measure these variables and find that they can explain to a significant extent (R-2=0.38) why some vulnerabilities are more frequently exploited than others. The severity of vulnerabilities does not significantly increase the frequency with which they are targeted, while the presence of Proof-of-Concept exploit code does increase it. We also observe that the availability of a patch reduces the frequency of being targeted, yet that more complex patches are associated with higher frequency. In terms of exposure, more widespread device models are more likely to be targeted by exploits. We end with recommendations to disincentivize attackers from targeting vulnerabilities.
While organizations spend millions of dollars on developing security systems at the highest level, one of the most significant areas of weaknesses, and loss remain their employees. Lack of employee training and security expertise, therefore, can cause huge loss, despite other measure being put in place. Cyberattacks are often able to commit cybercrime due to a lack of qualified cyber-security staff and the limited number of IT staff employed to keep pace with continuing security development and advancement. Testing, training and employing staff therefore is a critical measure for all organizations to reduce the vulnerabilities yet seems to be an area still not fully addressed. Businesses and organizations need to provide training to promote understanding for staff at every level, so they are aware of their roles and responsibilities in protecting against security threats. However, this is a colossal undertaking, and until this learning gap is resolved, financial institutions must continue to fight and efficiently manage cybersecurity threats. The aim of the current research paper is to present and propose a semi-automated risk assessment framework and a security maturity model, which can be helpful for auditors, security officers and managers. It is based on the ISO 27001 and utilize the relevant standards as well. The related risk management solution is a web-based software application. The current study targeted information security in Kosovo, specifically in the banking sector, IT industry and insurance field.
Rapid technological improvements have brought significant hazards to sensitive data and information. Cyberspace has connected various data structures, ranging from private communications/transactions to government activities. Cyberattacks are growing more complex which emphasizes the need to improve cybersecurity. Cyber security is more crucial as everything becomes more digital and as the number of connected devices keeps increasing. Cyber security techniques are used to keep networks, applications, and devices safe from intruders. Cloud and IoT technologies have expanded the complexity of computing, communication, and networking infrastructures, making cybercrime prevention more difficult. It takes a long time to develop threat recognition algorithms by the existing methods. Innovative strategies, like employing deep learning tools for cybersecurity, are anticipated to provide a solution to the issue. Deep learning approaches have many benefits which include the ability to solve complex problems quickly, high levels of automation, the best use of informal information, the capacity to generate excellent results at a lower cost, and the ability to recognize complex interactions. A diverse range of applications can be employed in deep learning models to make decisions based on predictions in the daily routine. The significant benefits of deep learning-enabled cyber security have improved security and reduced risks. The intensity of this systematic study provides consolidated knowledge about recent trends and serves as a foundation for future research in Deep learning-enabled Cybersecurity. This paper highlights the potential challenges and current cybersecurity issues with cutting-edge Deep Learning technologies.
Since cyber-attacks are ever-increasing in number, intensity, and variety, a strong need for a global, standardized cyber-security knowledge database has emerged as a means to prevent and fight cybercrime. Attempts already exist in this regard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list documents numerous reported software and hardware vulnerabilities, thus building a community-based dictionary of existing threats. The MITRE ATT&CK Framework describes adversary behavior and offers mitigation strategies for each reported attack pattern. While extremely powerful on their own, the tremendous extra benefit gained when linking these tools cannot be overlooked. This paper introduces a dataset of 1813 CVEs annotated with all corresponding MITRE ATT&CK techniques and proposes models to automatically link a CVE to one or more techniques based on the text description from the CVE metadata. We establish a strong baseline that considers classical machine learning models and state-of-the-art pre-trained BERT-based language models while counteracting the highly imbalanced training set with data augmentation strategies based on the TextAttack framework. We obtain promising results, as the best model achieved an F1-score of 47.84%. In addition, we perform a qualitative analysis that uses Lime explanations to point out limitations and potential inconsistencies in CVE descriptions. Our model plays a critical role in finding kill chain scenarios inside complex infrastructures and enables the prioritization of CVE patching by the threat level. We publicly release our code together with the dataset of annotated CVEs.
A large number of domains are abused every day for cybercrime. At the same time, the fight against abusive domains is not the fight of one person or organization but a battle that requires the cooperation of the entire community. However, very little research has been done to quantify the positive benefits of this strategy for dealing with abusive domains. As a result, using pornography and gambling domain names as examples, we present the first empirical study evaluating the usability and effectiveness of all Internet entities (e.g., registrars and hosting providers) in the DNS ecosystem for receiving and handling abusive domain reports. First, the paper thoroughly demonstrates the mechanisms for receiving and handling abusive domain reports at various Internet entities in China. Second, we select and report the appropriate 2433 abusive domains to 43 service providers across six categories of Internet entities. Finally, we discover the methods and response time used by each Internet entity to handle abuse reports based on the changes in reported domains. Based on the above data, we analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of Internet entities in dealing with abusive domains. Moreover, we indicate the scope of protection and disadvantages of each method, i.e., whether the abusive domain can escape handling. The paper aims to provide a more detailed overview and reference for the security communities, service providers, and Internet entities concerned with dealing with abusive domains.
Steadily growing Internet trade and calculations in electronic money on the Internet create new difficulties of protection of the rights within national legal systems. Despite the legislation is becoming stricter in terms of the procedure of electronic payments and the appropriate license is needed, some payment service providers work illegally. The owners of the exclusive rights to goods delivery and trademarks bear losses due to Internet trade, that allows purchasing goods remotely, that means out of the jurisdiction of the national right of the exclusive distributor. More and more daily functions are shifted from the human who is competent and delictual to robots and artificial intelligence, which don't have any rights and duties in legal understanding. It has significant effect on the content and element of offense. The issue goes to the subject of offense as it is not always possible to establish if it is an undelictual human owing to various factors. More and more offenses have cross-border nature. Working within the national legal system of one state, the companies in parallel violate the rights and the interests of competitors protected by the legislation of another state. There is a necessity to develop international legal system that enables to protect effectively all the participants of the world market. International cooperation within cybercrime is not sufficient as it covers only the most serious crimes in virtual networks, disregarding more serious offenses.

One of the tasks Law Enforcement Agencies are responsible for is to find evidence of criminal activities in the Darknet. However, visiting thousands of domains to locate visual information containing illicit acts manually requires a considerable amount of time and human resources. To support this task, in this paper, we explore the automatic classification of images uploaded to Tor darknet. Unfortunately, the foreground objects on such images are not always presented standalone, without background, due to the environmental conditions. To address this challenge on the digital investigation of Tor darknet visual content, we propose to classify automatically only relevant parts of the image combining saliency maps, i.e. to select the regions with the most salient information, with Bag of Visual Words (BoVW). We introduce Semantic Attention Keypoint Filtering (SAKF), a filtering strategy that removes non-significant features at a pixel level that mainly do not belong to the object of interest or foreground. We assessed SAKF on seven publicly available datasets, obtaining from 1.64 to 15.73 points higher accuracies than the method set as the baseline, i.e. BoVW using dense SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors. We also compared SAKF filtering performance against the deep features extracted from two well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, namely MobileNet and ResNet50. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight that the use of automatic image classification could be advantageous to support daily Law Enforcement Agencies investigations on Tor darknet.

Family relationships are the basis for a stable family atmosphere. Now with the internet, which has become a tangible part of our lives, membership of virtual communities, including social networks, has grown. It has created fundamental changes in the structure of social relationships and human interaction, forming a new framework of virtual interactions that transcend international borders. Due to their significance, unavoidability, availability, confidentiality, ease of use, and intrusive nature through interaction and sharing, virtual communities now extend beyond the individual and related level of risk. This study aimed to assess the cultural and behavioral risks of virtual interactions for Saudi families and their level of incidence and likelihood. It belonged to descriptive studies, using the social survey for a sample (1524) from Hail region families between 15 December 2022 and 31 January 2023, and was based on the list of cultural and behavioral risks of virtual interactions. Results showed that the most dangerous social networking sites for Saudi families were TikTok, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram respectively. Matrix results showed that 66.7% of virtual interaction threats have a high severity and likelihood, namely: adopting atheistic ideas, spreading the thought of hate, undermining the values of the Saudi family, and adopting ideas that incite violence from cultural threats, privacy hacks, cyber-bullying, fraud, violence, social isolation and cybercrime from behavioral threats. The study recommends adopting a social risk management (SRM) concept, especially regarding risks to family, because it is a new dimension of social protection.
Researchers have given a lot of attention to the relationship between religion and crime, finding that religion tends to have a deterring influence on crime-related attitudes and behaviors. This paper first examined the relationship between religiosity and cyberbullying, then ascertained how justice system could prevent cyberbullying behavior, through social and educational initiatives. The data was collected through normative juridical methods to provide a constructive understanding of the perspective of criminal law related to cyberbullying. It was revealed that the constitutional law took cognizance of cyberbullying, more than the religious laws, to curb cyberbullying in Indonesia on the pretext that cybercrimes took place in the cyberspace and not in real public. The findings also revealed an absence of the religious laws, and the increase in the cyber-sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where social media and other websites are indulged in slander and hoax with a view to insult Islamic leaders and their groups based on their religious affiliations, faith or ethnicity. Like the West and other developed nations, Indonesia has also thus witnessed cyber bullying and cybercrime incidents targeting individuals belonging to a particular religion, faith or ideology. The justice institutions and Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kementerian Agama) made several attempts to prevent this but the absence of robust religious laws were felt. The study concluded with recommending to take fresh insight into cyberbullying and its combating legal measures in the Indonesian religious justice system, appropriately aided by social and community initiatives.
Cybersecurity threats, including those involving machine learning, mal -ware, phishing, and cryptocurrency, have become more sophisticated. They target sensitive information and put institutions, governments, and individuals in a con-tinual state of risk. In 2019, phishing attacks became one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats. Such attacks attempt to steal sensitive data, such as login and payment card details, from financial, social, and educational websites. Many universities have suffered data breaches, serving as a prime example of victims of attacks on educational websites. Owing to advances in phishing tactics, strategies, and technologies, the end-user is the main victim of an attack scenario. According to several studies, the end-user can play a significant role in preventing a phishing attack. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the levels of user aware-ness regarding cyber threats and explore the relationship between the knowledge on cybercrimes and the awareness of phishing, within the context of cybercrime targeting educational websites. An observational experiment using 'think aloud' method was conducted with 20 students from Taif University. The results indi-cated that although the participants demonstrated an advanced level of informa-tion technology experience as specialists in computer science and computer engineering, their susceptibility to phishing was high. The results of this study will contribute to the cybersecurity research field in terms of proposing risk man-agement plans, delivering embedded training to end-users, and improving spam detecting tools.
In the age of globalization and sophistication of information technology, society is increasingly exposed to current changes and criminal threats such as personal security threats through online applications like Facebook. Therefore, this study discusses the forms of personal security threats through Facebook and its solution in Malaysia. Facebook is one of the most popular communication mediums in Malaysia and has millions of users both domestically and abroad. It is friendly, easy, fast and can share all your daily activities whether in writing, picture or video status. This study aims to highlight the forms of personal security threats that start on Facebook, give public awareness to the Malaysian community while using Facebook and provide recommendations on remedial measures before or after fraud on social media. This study used qualitative methods to obtain data and information from the Royal Malaysian Police, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission as well as the library study. The study found that Facebook helps people to connect, trading and communicate with individuals and communities. However, it also has an impact on personal safety for individuals, communities and organizations through cybercrime threats, fraud, data theft, exploitation and leakage of personal information, love fraud, slander, cyberbullying, encourage teen problems and cheating couples. This study can help the public to be more cautious when using Facebook, not just provide personal information to strangers and give them exposure to the actions they need to take when they become victims of fraud.
In the current Internet of things era, all companies shifted from paper-based data to the electronic format. Although this shift increased the efficiency of data processing, it has security drawbacks. Healthcare databases are a precious target for attackers because they facilitate identity theft and cybercrime. This paper presents an approach for database damage assessment for healthcare systems. Inspired by the current behavior of COVID-19 infections, our approach views the damage assessment problem the same way. The malicious transactions will be viewed as if they are COVID-19 viruses, taken from infection onward. The challenge of this research is to discover the infected transactions in a minimal time. The proposed parallel algorithm is based on the transaction dependency paradigm, with a time complexity O((M+NQ+N boolean AND 3)/L) (M = total number of transactions under scrutiny, N = number of malicious and affected transactions in the testing list, Q = time for dependency check, and L = number of threads used). The memory complexity of the algorithm is O(N+KL) (N = number of malicious and affected transactions, K = number of transactions in one area handled by one thread, and L = number of threads). Since the damage assessment time is directly proportional to the denial-of-service time, the proposed algorithm provides a minimized execution time. Our algorithm is a novel approach that outperforms other existing algorithms in this domain in terms of both time and memory, working up to four times faster in terms of time and with 120,000 fewer bytes in terms of memory.
In response to internal and external stimuli, the Royal Bhutan Police (RBP) faces the challenges of organizational change. As it continues its transition from military to civilian policing, responds to rapid social transformation in Bhutan, and adjusts to changes in service demands, the RBP must assess and improve its organizational and individual level competencies. This study considers issues associated with this transition in policing approach. Through the analysis of evidence from the Royal Bhutan Police's (RBP) commissioned officers, it specifically considers the agency's police culture and assesses competency areas requiring attention. The study seeks to identify the training needs of all 20 RBP districts in Bhutan. This was accomplished through a survey that targeted all RBP sworn officers. With an 82.9% response rate, the survey reveals that most of the study participants expressed the need for training in investigating cybercrime, bomb threat response, responding to terrorism, investigating accidental fire and arson, disaster management information technology skills, and rescuing and evacuating casualties. It also finds evidence to support an assessment that the RBP force needs training in areas directly related to modifying its culture to adjust to its civilian policing mission. Additional findings include incumbents in the rank of Police Major and above self-rating as more competent than Police Captain and below, and that male officers self-rate as more competent than female officers. The study results support the RBP's efforts to develop more relevant in-service training and may inform professionalizing police forces in other developing countries.
Cybercrime is an online crime committing fraud, stealing identities, violating privacy or hacking the personal information. A high level of information security in banking can be attained through striving to achieve an integrity, confidentiality, availability, assurance, and accountability. This Pandemic situation (COVID-19) paved the way for the customers to avoid traditional ways of banking and adapt to digital transactions. This banking digitalization increases in the utilization of cashless transactions like digital money (Cryptocurrency). Cyber security is imperative to preserve sensitive information, therefore, Blockchain technology has been adapted to provide security. Transactions done via Blockchain are tested through every block, which makes transactions secure and helps the banking system to work faster. The proposed algorithm WFB is used to estimate the average queue rate and avoid unwanted block generation. Then the trapezoidal fuzzy technique optimizes the allocation of blocks. An objective of this investigation is to enhance the security in banking systems from Cybercrimes by verifying Rain Drop Service (RDS) and Fingerprint Biometric without the need of any central authority. Once the service is completed, the service is a dropout and the following new service will be provided (Hence the name RDS). For the strong authentication scheme to fight against bank fraud, RSA encryption technique has been implemented successfully. Therefore, Blockchain technology increases the need for cyber security as a part of design architecture which intends to detect the stemming attacks in real time instead of repairing the damage.
Background: The pricing of illicit drugs is typically approached within the risks and prices framework. Recent sociological and economic studies of prices in online drug markets have stressed the centrality of reputation for price formation. In this paper, we propose an account of price formation that is based on the risks and prices framework, but also incorporates internal social organization to explain price variation. We assess the model empirically, and extend the current empirical literature by including payment methods and informal ranking as influences on drug pricing. Methods: We apply our model to estimate the prices of cannabis, cocaine, and heroin in two online drug markets, cryptomarkets ( n = 92 . 246). Using multilevel linear regression, we assess the influence of product qualities, reputation, payment methods, and informal ranking on price formation. Results: We observe extensive quantity discounts varying across substances and countries, and find premia and discounts associated with product qualities. We find evidence of payment method price adjustment, but contrary to expectation we observe conflicting evidence concerning reputation and status. We assess the robustness of our findings concerning reputation by comparing our model to previous approaches and alternative specifications. Conclusion: We contribute to an emerging economic sociological approach to the study illicit markets by develop-ing an account of price formation that incorporates cybercrime scholarship and the risks and prices framework. We find that prices in online drug markets reflect both external institutional constraint and internal social pro-cesses that reduce uncertainty.
Identifying the software used in a cybercrime can play a key role in establishing the evidence against the perpetrator in the court of law. This can be achieved by various means, one of which is to utilize the RAM contents. RAM comprises vital information about the current state of a system, including its running processes. Accordingly, the memory footprint of a process can be used as evidence about its usage. However, this evidence can be influenced by several factors. This paper evaluates three of these factors. First, it evaluates how the used programming language affects the evidence. Second, it evaluates how the used platform affects the evidence. Finally, it evaluates how the search for this evidence is influenced by the implicitly used encoding scheme. Our results should assist the investigator in its quest to identify the best amount of evidences about the used software based on its execution logic, host platform, language used, and the encoding of its string values. Results show that the amount of digital evidence is highly affected by these factors. For instance, the memory footprint of a Java based software is often more traceable than the footprints of languages such as C++ and C#. Moreover, the memory footprint of a C# program is more visible on Linux than it is on Windows or Mac OS. Hence, often software related values are successfully identified in RAM memory dumps even after the program is stopped.
The era of Internet of Things and 4th Industrial Revolution generate digital generation who has different life style. No doubt that the digital technologies become an important and centre of the generation life. The technologies change the way they play, communicate, work, and study. As a result the technologies force educational institutions, from primary school up to university, to change their learning system. Therefore many institutions have introduced and implemented variety of technology based learning, such as open learning, social learning, flipped learning, Massive Open Online Courses, etc. Accordingly, the institutions have to provide those technologies for all students, teachers, staffs, and their stakeholders for professional purposes, i.e. teaching and learning, and personal purposes, i.e. communicating, creating and socialising. Thus it is challenging the traditional concept of learning. The institutions fully understand numerous benefits of using digital technology for both professional and personal purposes. The technology creates the learning environment that everyone can teach anyone, more personal learning, and create more creativity and innovation beyond the limits of our imagination. On the other hand the institutions should conscious disadvantages of using the technology without knowing digital literacies. Digital literacies are key skill to develop to actively managing users' online presence. Teachers, students, and all staffs must aware to safe use of digital technologies. The institutions have a responsibility to educate cyber safety to people responsible behaviour when using digital technologies to prevent or to minimize cyberbullying, cybercrime, and plagiarism.
A novel concept of a metric hull has recently been introduced to encompass a set of objects by a few selected border objects. Following one of the metric-hull computation methods that generate a hierarchy of metric hulls, we introduce a metric index structure for unstructured and complex data, a Metric Hull Tree (MH-tree). We propose a construction of MH-tree by a bulk-loading procedure and outline an insert operation. With respect to the design of the tree, we provide an implementation of an approximate kNN search operation. Finally, we utilized the Profimedia dataset to evaluate various building and ranking strategies of MH-tree and compared the results with M-tree.
"With the advent of information and communication technology, the digital space is becoming a playing ground for criminal activities. Criminals typically prefer darkness or a hidden place to perform their illegal activities in a real-world while sometimes covering their face to avoid being exposed and getting caught. The same applies in a digital world where criminals prefer features which provide anonymity or hidden features to perform illegal activities. It is from this spirit the Darkweb is attracting all kinds of criminal activities conducted over the Internet such as selling drugs, illegal weapons, child pornography, assassination for hire, hackers for hire, and selling of malicious exploits, to mention a few. Although the anonymity offered by Darkweb can be exploited as a tool to arrest criminals involved in cybercrime, an in-depth research is needed to advance criminal investigation on Darkweb. Analysis of illegal activities conducted in Darkweb is in its infancy and faces several challenges like lack of standard operating procedures. This study proposes progressive standard operating procedures (SOPs) for Darkweb forensics investigation. We provide the four stages of SOP for Darkweb investigation. The proposed SOP consists of the following stages; identification and profiling, discovery, acquisition and preservation, and the last stage is analysis and reporting. In each stage, we consider the objectives, tools and expected results of that particular stage. Careful consideration of this SOP revealed promising results in the Darkweb investigation."
Processing large volumes of various data requires index structures that can efficiently organize them on secondary memory. Methods based on pivot permutations have become popular because of their tremendous querying performance. Pivot permutations can be perceived as a recursive Voronoi tessellation with a fixed set of anchors. Its disadvantage is that it cannot adapt to the data distribution well, which leads to cells unbalanced in occupation and unevenly filled disk buckets. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a novel schema called the BM-index. It exploits a weighted Voronoi partitioning, which is able to respect the data distribution. We present an algorithm to balance the data partitions, and show its correctness. The secondary memory is then accessed efficiently, which is shown in experiments executing k-nearest neighbors queries on a real-life image collection CoPhIR.
"The article explores the relationship between screen time and physical and mental health of young people, such as visual impairment, sleeplessness, eating disorders, as well as Internet addiction, loneliness, and depression.The article contains the results of the survey, conducted in November-December 2019 in Russia (Saratov region) among university students aged 18-22 (n=386) to identify the connection between virtual communication in social networks and the youth's mental health. The main research method was a survey. The questionnaire consisted of 25 questions, which were divided into four blocks: 1) the amount of screen time daily; 2) subjective attitude towards virtual friendship and communication; 3) characteristics of individuals, communicating with online; 4) the attitude to online communication as a way to overcome loneliness. As a result, on-line activity of young people does not lead to the development of sociability, building real friendships or romantic relationships, it takes a lot of time, enhancing the feeling of loneliness and provoking the emergence of depression. The author highlights the problem areas that impede the effective solution of these problems: the ambiguity of the experts' opinions regarding the impact of digital technology on the development of modern teenagers and youth; the conflict of interests between providers, business structures, advertisers and minor users; poor Internet literacy of parents and educators compared with modern teenagers and youth that hinders the development of adequate technologies for early detection, prevention and providing assistance to minors who could become real or potential victims of cybercrime."
This paper focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of in Jordanian E-banking sector. It also discusses the local awareness and familiarization of E-banking in Small to Midsized Enterprises-SMEs of Jordan and gives a consistent assessment of Jordan's current and future E-banking best practices. This paper initially has used secondary data to provide a study of F-banking in Jordan, how to overcome the hurdles in SMEs of Jordan necessary for SMEs to help facilitate E-banking adoption. The research is subject to top academic journal articles, corporate project data and reports, media articles, government and non government corporation-based documents and other appropriate information. Data were also collected by using interviews from Jordan E-business based organizations those are offering goods and services on electronic channels and professionals involved with E-banking related activities. The study found that F-banking is steadily transforming the way businesses to be conducted and changing the business environment in Jordan. E-banking can provide speedier, faster and reliable services to the customers for which they are relatively happy. E-banking services not only can develop new competitive advantages, it can improve its relationships with customers. As a developing country, Jordan is not fully known about E-banking sector. As a result, this paper also overviews the issues associated with E-banking e.g. cybercrime and try to explore the future challenges and prospects in Jordan. This paper also compares the local E-business sites with worldwide brand E-business sites to make an effective solution of Jordan's E-banking.
As countries are embracing the economic and social potential of the Internet of Everything (IoE)-the intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things, the world is seeing the cyberspace as a new battleground Along these lines, the information age security policy, strategy, and management face exceptional challenges. Traditional strategies and approaches to security need revision to apply to a future where threats can propagate instantaneously and where the identity or location of an adversary may not be known. Is Africa prepared, preparing, or at risk? Using the Cyber Readiness Index the paper also assesses the future risks the top 12 emerging economies in Africa that have embraced ICT and the Internet may face and compares their maturity and commitment to protecting those investments using an initial objective assessment of where each country stands in cyber security across five areas including Articulation and publication of a National Cyber Security Strategy, availability of operational Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) or Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) demonstration of commitment to protect against cybercrime, availability of information sharing mechanism, investment in cyber security basic and applied research and funding cyber security initiatives broadly. This differs from previous studies that have focused only on the cyber readiness of the North Pole. Findings raise fundamental questions and concerns for the African Union (AU) on fostering partnerships between African governments to promote better information sharing by further developing collaboration tools to heighten cyber resilience against pre-empted potential cyber war and terrorism especially between or among regional economic powers
Monitoring plays a crucial role in the operation of any sizeable distributed IT infrastructure. Whether it is a university network or cloud datacenter, monitoring information is continuously used in a wide spectrum of ways ranging from mission-critical jobs, e.g. accounting or incident handling, to equally important development-related tasks, e.g. debugging or fault-detection. Whilst pursuing a novel vision of new-generation event-driven monitoring systems, we have identified that a particularly rich source of monitoring information, computer logs, is also one of the most problematic in terms of automated processing. Log data are predominantly generated in an adhoc manner using a variety of incompatible formats with the most important pieces of information, i.e. log messages, in the form of unstructured strings. This clashes with our long-term goal of designing a system enabling its users to transparently define real-time continuous queries over homogeneous streams of properly defined monitoring event objects with explicitly described structure. Our goal is to bridge this gap by normalizing the poorly structured log data into streams of structured event objects. The combined challenge of this goal is structuring the log data, whilst considering the high velocity with which they are generated in modern IT infrastructures. This paper summarizes the contributions of a dissertation thesis, Normalization of Unstructured Log Data into Streams of Structured Event Objects dealing with the matter at hand in detail.
The number of malware infected machines from all over the world has been growing day by day. New malware variants appear in the wild to evade the malware detection and classification systems and may infect with ransomware or crypto miners for adversary financial gain. A recent colonial pipeline ransomware attack is an example of these attacks that impacted daily human activities, and the victim had to pay ransom to restore their operations. Windows-based systems are the most adopted systems across different industries for running applications. They are prone to get targeted by installing the malware. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform the malware classification on Portable Executable (PE) binary files using the fusion feature set approach. We present an extensive performance evaluation of various DL model architecture and Machine Learning (ML) classifier i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), on multi-aspect feature sets covering the static, dynamic, and image features to select the proposed CNN model. We further leverage the CNN-based architecture for effective classification of the malware using different combinations of feature sets and compare the results with the best-performed individual feature set. Our performance evaluation of the proposed model shows that the model classifies the malware or benign files with an accuracy of 97% when using fusion feature sets. The proposed model is robust and generalizable and showed similar performances on completely unseen two malware datasets. In addition, the embedding features of the CNN model are visualized, and various visualization methods are employed to understand the characteristics of the datasets. Further, large-scale learning and stacked classifiers were employed after the penultimate layer to enhance the CNN classification performance.
"A comprehensive taxonomy of fraud is presented based on morphological analysis, attribute listing and matrix analysis. Fraud matrix and tree classification frameworks are presented and discussed. They are then utilized to classify and explain a number of the different types of frauds, shown in the fraud matrix classification framework. First, triangular attributes of fraud are formulated, followed by fraud channels and elementary fraud features. Several well-known fraud types are identified using the proposed fraud classification framework. Further, new fraud types are discovered using the framework, for example, transactional frauds, automated frauds, synchronized fraud, unwitting accomplice, and 'Robin Hood' fraud. The importance of the taxonomy is that it can be used to classify both existing and newly identified fraud types in a way and manner that has not been previously reported; that is, it offers understanding to the different classes of frauds, the inherent threat actors behind such frauds, their capabilities, intent and the resulting nature of the frauds. This taxonomy has potential to offer insight in how appropriate countermeasures to mitigating the different types of frauds could be formulated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Log message abstraction is a common way of dealing with the unstructured nature of log data. It refers to the separation of static and dynamic part of the log message, so that both parts can be accessed independently, allowing the message to be abstracted into a more structured representation. To facilitate this task, so-called message types and the corresponding matching patterns must be first discovered, and only after that can be this pattern-set used to pattern-match individual log messages in order to extract dynamic information and impose some structure on them. Because the manual discovery of message types is a tiresome and error-prone process, we have focused our research on data mining algorithms that are able to discover message types in already generated log data. Since we have identified several deficiencies of the existing algorithms, which are limiting their capabilities, we propose a novel algorithm for message type discovery addressing these deficiencies.
"Recent years have seen rapid increases in cybercrime. The use of effective software security activities plays an important part in preventing the harm involved. Objective research on industry use of software security practices is needed to help development teams, academic researchers, and educators to focus their activities. Since 2008, a team of researchers, including two of the authors, has been gathering objective data on the use of 121 software security activities. The Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) study explores the activity use of 675,000 software developers, in companies including some of the world's largest and most security-focused. Our analysis of the study data shows little consistent growth in security activity adoption industry-wide until 2015. Since then, the data shows a strong increasing trend, along with the adoption of new activities to support cloud-based deployment, an emphasis on component security, and a reduction in security professionals' policing role. Exploring patterns of adoption, activities related to detecting and responding to vulnerabilities are adopted marginally earlier than activities related to preventing vulnerabilities; and activities related to particular job roles tend to be used together. We also found that 12 developer security activities are adopted early, together, and notably more often than any others. From these results, we offer recommendations for software and security engineers, and corresponding education and research suggestions for academia. These recommendations offer a strong contribution to improving security in development teams in the future."
The study of discursive understandings of cybervictimisation draws on a dataset of crime news reporting and asks the question of if and how cybervictimisation is construed in ways that differ from other types of (non-digital) victimisation. Building on a critical discourse perspective employing corpus-based text analysis methods, the composition of news discourses about cybervictimisation are analysed, alongside the relationship between such representations and news media discourse on crime victimisation generally. The aim is to see what effect the presence of a digital dimension has for how the notion of victimisation is socially and culturally understood. The study shows, first, that news reporting on cybervictimisation has a strong bias towards crimes that fit well with the notion of the ideal victim' (such as sexual victimisation and bullying) while excluding other types like hacking and identity theft. The question is raised whether victim' discourse is able to account for the latter types or if new understandings and concepts will emerge. Second, the study shows that discourses promoting understandings of technology as contributing to amplifying danger, and that represent technology as potentially undermining social order, are strong in cybervictimisation news reports. These discourses are consequential for who is seen as a legitimate victim and not. Just as it can be very difficult to identify and apprehend perpetrators of cybercrime, so is also the identification and definition of cybervictims ambiguous and demands to be further researched.
Of all the types of cybercrime that exist, hackers are the cybercriminals who have probably engaged both the imagination of the general public and the interest of the entertainment industry the most. They are also those who have elicited the greatest quantity of psychological academic literature. It seems that we have an unsatisfied desire to comprehend why any individual would be drawn to this type of activity, which seems in some cases to have little immediate benefit for the cybercriminal. This chapter aims to determine if we have discovered all that we need to about the psychology and motivations of hackers. Despite the vast quantities of literature in this area, it seems that we still do not have a thorough grasp on the mentality of the hacker. The chapter will commence with some background information regarding the methods used by hackers, a description of the history of hacking behaviour and terminology, and the legal dimensions of hacking. Following this, the chapter will consider the very diverse motives of hackers, as determined by psychological and criminological research. The personalities of computer hackers will then be examined, with special consideration of how psychological profiling could be used to help in solving hacking cases. Issues regarding punishment and prevention of hacking attacks will then be examined, and finally the difficulties in carrying out hacker research and potential directions for future research in this area will be explored.
Concern about national security has increased significantly since the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. The CIA, FBI, and other federal agencies are actively collecting domestic and foreign intelligence to prevent future attacks. These efforts have in turn motivated local authorities to more closely monitor criminal activities in their own jurisdictions. A major challenge facing all law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering organizations is accurately and efficiently analyzing the growing volumes of crime data. For example, complex conspiracies are often difficult to unravel because information on suspects can be geographically diffuse and span long periods of time. Detecting cybercrime can likewise be difficult because busy network traffic and frequent online transactions generate large amounts of data, only a small portion of which relates to illegal activities. Data mining is a powerful tool that enables criminal investigators who may lack extensive training as data analysts to explore large databases quickly and efficiently.(1) Computers can process thousands of instructions in seconds, saving precious time. In addition, installing and running software often costs less than hiring and training personnel. Computers are also less prone to errors than human investigators, especially those who work long hours. We present a general framework for crime data mining that draws on experience gained with the Coplink project (http://ai.bpa.arizona.edu/coplink), which researchers at the University of Arizona have been conducting in collaboration with the Tucson and Phoenix police departments since 1997.
Smartphones have become increasingly popular and nowadays with the using of 3G networks, the needs in terms of connectivity in a business environment are substantial. Malicious use of such devices is highly dangerous since users may be victims of such use. In this paper, we present two statistical methods (Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) and Minimum Volume Ellipsoid (MVE) used to detect abnormal smartphone's applications. Initial experiments results prove the efficiency and the accuracy of the MVE and MCD in detecting abnormal smartphone's applications.
Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in single image super-resolution (SR) research. However, due to the amplification of noise during the upsampling steps, state-of-the-art methods often fail at reconstructing high-resolution images from noisy versions of their low-resolution counterparts. However, this is especially important for images from unknown cameras with unseen types of image degradation. In this work, we propose to jointly perform denoising and super-resolution. To this end, we investigate two architectural designs: in-network combines both tasks at feature level, while pre-network first performs denoising and then super-resolution. Our experiments show that both variants have specific advantages: The in-network design obtains the strongest results when the type of image corruption is aligned in the training and testing dataset, for any choice of denoiser. The pre-network design exhibits superior performance on unseen types of image corruption, which is a pathological failure case of existing super-resolution models. We hope that these findings help to enable super-resolution also in less constrained scenarios where source camera or imaging conditions are not well controlled. Source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/angelvillar96/super-resolution-noisy-images.
"The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical infrastructure of any network, and, not surprisingly a common target of cybercrime. There are numerous works that analyse higher level DNS traffic to detect anomalies in the DNS or any other network service. By contrast, few efforts have been made to study and protect the recursive DNS level. In this paper, we introduce a novel abstraction of the recursive DNS traffic to detect a flooding attack, a kind of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The crux of our abstraction lies on a simple observation: Recursive DNS queries, from IP addresses to domain names, form social groups; hence, a DDoS attack should result in drastic changes on DNS social structure. We have built an anomaly-based detection mechanism, which, given a time window of DNS usage, makes use of features that attempt to capture the DNS social structure, including a heuristic that estimates group composition. Our detection mechanism has been successfully validated (in a simulated and controlled setting) and with it the suitability of our abstraction to detect flooding attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that work is successful in using this abstraction to detect these kinds of attacks at the recursive level. Before concluding the paper, we motivate further research directions considering this new abstraction, so we have designed and tested two additional experiments which exhibit promising results to detect other types of anomalies in recursive DNS servers."
Recently, the rapid popularity of smart phones significantly impacts the day-to-day activities of humans due to the increased access to social media and instant messaging services. The misuse of social media services leads to different cybercrime activities. Both the mobile device and cloud are the most significant evidential sources for the social network application forensics. It is essential to establish a mobile cloud forensic process to deal with the crime activities performed by the intelligent mobile user. Also, improving the cloud event traceability is a challenging task in a massive cloud environment. This work presents a mobile cloud forensic process that incorporates the time synchronization and inter and intra-application analysis along with the traditional forensic procedure. Time synchronization is a prerequisite process that facilitates the investigator to perform the application forensics in the mobile cloud concisely. An inter and intra-application analysis process ensures the extraction of the forensic-rich evidence and enriches the performance of the cloud event traceability by utilizing the metadata of potential mobile evidence. The proposed forensic process maintains a chronological timeline of evidence before correlating the potential evidence of the mobile and cloud. Eventually, it submits the extracted evidence with a chain of custody information to validate the forensic investigation process. It significantly enhances the accuracy of the investigation and produces evidence by applying the step by step process in the Android WeChat social network application. (C) 2020 The Authors.

"In recent years the number of cyber-attacks has dramatically increased, affecting military, government, business and home users. For example, the UK Ministry of Defence claims to have blocked and investigated over 1000 serious cyber-attacks in 2010 while in 2011 Detica reported that the cost of cybercrime in the UK is estimated to be 27 pound billion per annum. In cyber-attacks numerous methods exist that can be used to discover information about the attacking entity, otherwise termed as attribution. Attribution is a desired quality to counter a variety of attackers. Cyber-crime attribution can aid police investigations in identifying cyber criminals. In cyber warfare and conflict an attribution capability is desired to enhance decision making of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Attribution of terrorist cyber-attacks may help to prevent future attacks. Highly publicised attacks such as Stuxnet and Night Dragon have been subject to intense analysis, yet published attribution of these attacks has been minimal. The complexity of reliable attribution is increased by an attacker's ability to route attacks through compromised systems, anonymised networks, proxy servers and various jurisdictional boundaries. There are numerous technical attribution techniques ranging from traceback, malware inspection and honeypot deployment. In this paper we present a taxonomy to classify these techniques, using five different classes: acquired attributes, proposed/in use, external party involvement, sabotage opportunity and prepositioning depth. The novelty of this paper is its scope; classifying the landscape of technical attribution techniques."
"The COVID-19 brought several new challenges for the students and lecturers, particularly in higher education. The conventional physical classroom was almost instantly pushed into a new environment: a remote session class. And this lecturing paradigm shift occurred, necessarily, in a short period of time. The lecturing players suffered the pressure of using different learning tools and methodologies while exposing themselves to, in most part of cases, unexpected cybersecurity threats. The purpose of this article is to clarify all the new menaces that arose during this period. Also, to understand the level of exposure and impacts on the lecturer and student to this quick but necessary paradigm shift. Methodologically: two focus groups were undertook to capture representations of students about uses of computer technology; differences in exposure to threats before and during the pandemic and impacts on society; student's needs regarding the topic and suggestions about strategies for increasing overall knowledge about it. Answers were treated recurring to software webQDA (R)-Qualitative Data Analysis Software for analysis of qualitative data. Results depict the exposure to cybersecurity issues and some level of knowledge about them, inducing preventive practices when using informatics technology. Sense of increasing insecurity in society is associated with the statement of increasing activity regarding cybercrime, giving way to the assumption of the need of awareness and knowledge of general public regarding this issues, and rise suggestions on teaching approaches directed to the subject."
With the rapid development of science and technology pushing people into the information age, the appearance of information technology is a major change for the accounting industry, which will redefine the traditional accounting profession. The new management techniques and concepts also gradually change the traditional accounting working mode by promoting the development of accounting professionals from traditional accounting to accounting information. In recent years, cybercrime and attacking information system vulnerability have occurred frequently. This study utilizes the model and technology in the design of an accounting information management system by simply explaining the idea of cloud technology and examining its logical structure of cloud technology. After that, it designs the cloud platform architecture of the accounting information management system (AIMS) by building the SaaS model. It defines the distributed storage mode of the cloud platform and tests the cluster performance of the system after completing the system design and construction to judge the application effect of the system. Finally, the system operation time, local rows of data, and load balancing are tested experimentally. These results demonstrate that the response relationships of distinct tasks are modified higher than TeraSort, TeraSort higher than Inquiry, and response time is proportional to the amount of Reduce slots when input tasks are the same. The analysis shows that the large data cloud platform used in this paper has high operational efficiency, acceleration rate, and task execution rate.
Countless cybercrime instances have shown the need for detecting and blocking obscene material from social media sites. Deep learning methods (DLMs) outperformed in recognizing obscene content flooded on many online platforms. However, these contemporary DLMs primarily treat the recognition of obscene content as a simple task of binary classification, rather than focusing on the labelling of obscene areas. Hence, many of these methods could not pay attention to the fact that misclassification samples are so diverse. Therefore, this paper focuses on two aspects (i) developing a deep learning model that could classify and label the obscene portion, and (ii) generating a labelled obscene image dataset with a wide variety of obscene samples to minimize the risks of inaccurate recognition. We have proposed a method named S3Pooling based bottleneck attention module (BAM) embedded MobileNetV2-YOLOv3 (SBMYv3) for automatic detection of obscene content using an attention mechanism and a suitable pooling strategy. The key contributions of our article are: (i) generation of a well-labelled obscene image dataset with a variety of augmentation strategies using Pix-2-Pix GAN (ii) modifications to the backend architecture of YOLOv3 using MobileNetV2 and BAM to ensure focused and accurate feature extraction, and (iii) selection of an optimal pooling strategy, that is, S3Pooling strategy, while taking the design of the feature extractor into account. The proposed SBMYv3 model outperformed other state-of-the-art models with 99.26% testing accuracy, 99.39% recall, 99.13% precision, and 99.13% IoU values respectively.
The number of fraud occurrences in electronic banking is rising each year. Experts in the field of cybercrime are continuously monitoring and verifying network infrastructure and transaction systems. Dedicated threat response teams (CSIRTs) are used by organizations to ensure security and stop cyber attacks. Financial institutions are well aware of this and have increased funding for CSIRTs and antifraud software. If the company has a rule-based antifraud system, the CSIRT can examine fraud cases and create rules to counter the threat. If not, they can attempt to analyze Internet traffic down to the packet level and look for anomalies before adding network rules to proxy or firewall servers to mitigate the threat. However, this does not always solve the issues, because transactions occasionally receive a gray rating. Nevertheless, the bank is unable to approve every gray transaction because the number of call center employees is insufficient to make this possible. In this study, we designed a machine-learning-based rating system that provides early warnings against financial fraud. We present the system architecture together with the new ML-based scoring extension, which examines customer logins from the banking transaction system. The suggested method enhances the organization's rule-based fraud prevention system. Because they occur immediately after the client identification and authorization process, the system can quickly identify gray operations. The suggested method reduces the amount of successful fraud and improves call center queue administration.
The use of cyber weapons raises many issues, one of which is the scope of legal requirements affecting the legal review of cyber weapons under Additional Protocol I and customary international law. This paper explores the review of cyber weapons intended for use below the threshold of armed conflict As the line between war and peace is often increasingly blurred and the majority of cyber incidents are below the threshold of armed conflict, the laws and principles of international humanitarian law do not apply. In this paper, we engage in a scenariobased thought experiment exploring the legal framework affecting the use of cyber weapons outside armed conflict. In such situations, the well-known article 36 of Additional Protocol I and customary international law are not triggered. As a result, there is no explicit legal obligation to conduct a cyber weapons review in situations when cyber weapons are deployed in situations falling below the threshold of armed conflict. Our starting point is that even though international humanitarian law is not applicable, the use of cyber weapons is not completely unregulated. In the paper, we search for answer to following research question: what are the legal requirements for weapons review in situations where their intended use is for situations below the threshold of armed conflict? We identify the black-letter legal framework and explore the state practice of NATO member states where available. The paper argues that there are many obligations to be considered when deploying cyber weapons in situations below the threshold of armed conflict. The conclusion is that there is no obligation to conduct a review outside Article 36 of Additional Protocol I. That being said, there are definitely policy benefits in conducting broader software assessment to ensure respect to international law obligations of a state.
As an increasing amount of crime takes on a digital aspect, law enforcement bodies must tackle an online environment generating huge volumes of data. With manual inspections becoming increasingly infeasible, law enforcement bodies are optimising online investigations through data-mining technologies. Such technologies must be well designed and rigorously grounded, yet no survey of the online data-mining literature exists which examines their techniques, applications and rigour. This article remedies this gap through a systematic mapping study describing online data-mining literature which visibly targets law enforcement applications, using evidence-based practices in survey making to produce a replicable analysis which can be methodologically examined for deficiencies.
"Most people are exposed to risks both in the online and offline world. Several studies have provided definitions and measures of cybervictimization based on different theoretical approaches and most of them have focused on specific forms of cybercrime, depicting a limited portrayal of victimization. The current study explored victimization configurations in a sample of 749 university undergraduates from Spain (61.6% women; M age = 26.9), utilizing latent class analyses to account for the nature and frequency of various types of online and offline victimization along their life span. Among them, 35.9% were victims of a cyberattack, 24.4% reported being victims of cyberfraud and 49% of property crime. The analysis uncovered two classes of cybervictims-consisting of economic cybervictimization (victims of economic cybercrimes only) and cyber-polyvictimization (victims of various types of cybercrimes)-and allowed us to compare them with a group of non-victims. Younger respondents (15 to 25 years old), conventional university students, women, people with lower incomes and LGBTQI+ individuals have a higher representation in the cyber-polyvictimization class. In addition, members of this class have suffered more offline victimization in all the areas analyzed. The present study has found co-occurrence between online and offline victimization, thus reinforcing the relevance of simultaneously studying both areas and the interaction between them. From this empirical ground, prevention strategies should not be focused merely on opportunity factors related to the online interactions and behavior of potential victims, without facing the deep human and social roots of victimization."
Synthetic biology has the potential to positively transform society in many application areas, including medicine. In common with all revolutionary new technologies, synthetic biology can also enable crime. Like cybercrime, that emerged following the advent of the internet, biocrime can have a significant effect on society, but may also impact on peoples' health. For example, the scale of harm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates the potential impact of future biocrime and highlights the need for prevention strategies. Systematic evidence quantifying the crime opportunities posed by synthetic biology has to date been very limited. Here, we systematically reviewed forms of crime that could be facilitated by synthetic biology with a view to informing their prevention. A total of 794 articles from four databases were extracted and a three-step screening phase resulted in 15 studies that met our threshold criterion for thematic synthesis. Within those studies, 13 exploits were identified. Of these, 46% were dependent on technologies characteristic of synthetic biology. Eight potential crime types emerged from the studies: bio-discrimination, cyber-biocrime, bio-malware, biohacking, at-home drug manufacturing, illegal gene editing, genetic blackmail, and neuro-hacking. 14 offender types were identified. For the most commonly identified offenders (>3 mentions) 40% were outsider threats. These observations suggest that synthetic biology presents substantial new offending opportunities. Moreover, that more effective engagement, such as ethical hacking, is needed now to prevent a crime harvest from developing in the future. A framework to address the synthetic biology crime landscape is proposed.
The surge in cybercrime has emerged as a pressing concern in contemporary society due to its far-reaching financial, social, and psychological repercussions on individuals. Beyond inflicting monetary losses, cyber-attacks exert adverse effects on the social fabric and psychological well-being of the affected individuals. In order to mitigate the deleterious consequences of cyber threats, adoption of an intelligent agent-based solution to enhance the speed and comprehensiveness of cyber intelligence is advocated. In this paper, a novel cyber intelligence solution is proposed, employing four semantic agents that interact autonomously to acquire crucial cyber intelligence pertaining to any given country. The solution leverages a combination of techniques, including a convolutional neural network (CNN), sentiment analysis, exponential smoothing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), Porter stemming, and others, to analyse data from both social media and web sources. The proposed method underwent evaluation from 13 October 2022 to 6 April 2023, utilizing a dataset comprising 37,386 tweets generated by 30,706 users across 54 languages. To address non-English content, a total of 8199 HTTP requests were made to facilitate translation. Additionally, the system processed 238,220 cyber threat data from the web. Within a remarkably brief duration of 6 s, the system autonomously generated a comprehensive cyber intelligence report encompassing 7 critical dimensions of cyber intelligence for countries such as Russia, Ukraine, China, Iran, India, and Australia.
Objective: Our proposed study investigates the impact of cybersecurity awareness among children in terms of protecting them in cyberspace. The prevalence of cybercrime among children at the global and national levels imposes serious concerns. Cybercrimes penetrated largely during the digital transformation of education that facilitated children to access cyberspace unconditionally. Methodology: The research is based on reviewing the academic literature relevant to cybersecurity awareness's and its impact on protecting children in cyberspace. Main Findings: The findings highlight the significant role of cybersecurity awareness in reducing the impact of cyberattacks against children. Awareness of cybersecurity and the protection of children in cyberspace are interlinked with each other. Comprehensive cybersecurity awareness programs for children can significantly reduce the spread. Widespread awareness programs in the educational curriculum while utilizing all the required safety criteria to guarantee that the children are Trustworthy, secure, and ensuring their data safety is crucial step to consider. Social Implications: The article highlights the cybersecurity awareness measures that should be considered for children to provide them safe cyberspace platforms. Secure cyberspace for children to get education during the global spread of the Corona pandemic is the dire current social need. Originality/Novelty of the Study: The global spread of the Coronavirus has considerably affected people's daily lives. Due to increased dependability on online platforms during pandemic, we can name this situation as cyber-pandemic. Data breaches and cyberattacks rises dramatically due to a lack of cybersecurity awareness among the citizens.
Despite the efforts of information security experts, cybercrimes are still emerging at an alarming rate. Among the tools used by cybercriminals, malicious domains are indispensable and harm from the Internet has become a global problem. Malicious domains play an important role from SPAM and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) threats to Botnet and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks at large scales. To ensure there is not a single point of failure or to prevent their detection and blocking, malware authors have employed domain generation algorithms (DGAs) and domain-flux techniques to generate a large number of domain names for malicious servers. As a result, malicious servers are difficult to detect and remove. Furthermore, the clues of cybercrime are stored in network traffic logs, but analyzing long-term big network traffic data is a challenge. To adapt the technology of cybercrimes and automatically detect unknown malicious threats, we previously proposed a system called MD-Miner. To improve its efficiency and accuracy, we propose the MD-Miner(P) here, which generates more features with identification capabilities in the feature extraction stage. Moreover, MD-Miner(P) adapts interaction profiling bipartite graphs instead of annotated bipartite graphs. The experimental results show that MD-Miner(P) has better area under curve (AUC) results and found new malicious domains that could not be recognized by other threat intelligence systems. The MD-Miner(P) exhibits both scalability and applicability, which has been experimentally validated on actual enterprise network traffic.
Brand search results are poisoned by fake ecommerce websites that infringe on the trademark rights of legitimate holders. In this article, we study how to tackle and measure this problem automatically. We present a pipeline with two machine learning stages that can detect the ecommerce websites present in the list of brand search results and distinguish between legitimate and fake econunerce websites. For each classification task, we identify and extract suitable learning features and study their relative importance. Through a prototype system termed RI.SI.CO., we show that this approach is feasible, fast, and more accurate than both existing systems for trustworthiness assessment and non-expert humans. We next introduce two complementary metrics for evaluating the counterfeit incidence in brand search results: namely, a chart-based and a single-value measure. They allow us to analyze and compare counterfeit at various levels, including single brands within a specific sector as well as whole sectors. Experimenting with two luxury goods sectors, we report a number of interesting findings about how the main search parameters (e.g., search engine, query type, number of search results seen) affect counterfeiting and how this activity changes with time. On the whole, our research offers new insights and some very practical and useful means of analyzing and measuring counterfeit in brand search results, thus increasing awareness of and knowledge about this phenomenon and enabling targeted anti-counterfeiting actions.
"The research is aimed at substantiating the need to use a qualifying element with the use of information and telecommunication networks in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation to strengthen criminal responsibility for certain crimes related to the dissemination of prohibited information, and at formulating proposals for optimizing the criminal law protection of information security. The methodology deals with implementing knowledge from various branches of science, including information theory and jurisprudence. Traditional methods of jurisprudence are utilized simultaneously in an active manner. The results: The investigation underlines the significance of the criminal-law-related protection of the information space against the dissemination of information prohibited; reveals the possibilities of defining crimes as aggravated;-analyzes the cases of the use of the qualifying element committing a crime with the use of information and telecommunication networks;-checks the article on the equivalence of influence on the level of public danger of the crimes of the given element and the element committing a crime by means of the media;-confirms that the heterogeneity of the resources of the Internet or other networks cannot serve as an argument for denying such equivalence;-emphasizes the need to take into account such properties of these technologies as accessibility for the mass audience, relative anonymity of the user, remote functioning and transboundary nature in assessing the public danger of crimes committed with the use of information and telecommunication networks;-proves the need to assign the status of a qualifying element to the use of information and telecommunications networks in relation to such crimes as slander, public calls for the outbreak of an aggressive war and the rehabilitation of Nazism;-reveals technical and legal deficiencies of the criminal law description of the qualifying element being analyzed; and-determines the ways of their elimination. Methodology The methodology of the research involves knowledge from various branches of science including information theory and jurisprudence. At the same time, traditional methods of jurisprudence including the structured system analysis of criminal law, formal and logical proofs, etc. are utilized in an active manner. The conclusion draws the following inferences: (1) findings on the expediency of using the qualifying element being analyzed both to reflect one of the typical variants of the public way of committing a crime or the demonstrative nature of the latter and to take into account the exceptional characteristics of the distribution of prohibited information by means of information and telecommunication technologies; (2) recommendations to eliminate the shortcomings of criminal legislation related to the consolidation of the qualifying element with the use of information and telecommunication networks."
Cybercrime was estimated to cost the global economy $945 billion in 2020. Increasingly, law enforcement agencies are using social network analysis (SNA) to identify key hackers from Dark Web hacker forums for targeted investigations. However, past approaches have primarily focused on analyzing key hackers at a single point in time and use a hacker's structural features only. In this study, we propose a novel Hacker Evolution Identification Framework to identify how hackers evolve within hacker forums. The proposed framework has two novelties in its design. First, the framework captures features such as user statistics, node-level metrics, lexical measures, and post style, when representing each hacker with unsupervised graph embedding methods. Second, the framework incorporates mechanisms to align embedding spaces across multiple time-spells of data to facilitate analysis of how hackers evolve over time. Two experiments were conducted to assess the performance of prevailing graph embedding algorithms and nodal feature variations in the task of graph reconstruction in five time-spells. Results of our experiments indicate that Text-Associated Deep-Walk (TADW) with all of the proposed nodal features outperforms methods without nodal features in terms of Mean Average Precision in each time-spell. We illustrate the potential practical utility of the proposed framework with a case study on an English forum with 51,612 posts. The results produced by the framework in this case study identified key hackers posting piracy assets.
"The petro-chemical industry is a critical infrastructure that is vulnerable to cybercrime. In particular, industrial process control systems contain many vulnerabilities and are known targets for hackers. A cyberattack to a chemical facility can cause enormous risks to the economy, the environment, and public health and safety. This gives rise to the question how corporate cybersecurity has developed; how it is governed; and whether it should be subject to public oversight. This paper presents a case study of the governance of cybersecurity in the petrochemical industry in the Rotterdam Mainport area in the Netherlands, which reflects the 'new governance' view that cybersecurity can best be governed through voluntary public-private partnerships. The paper finds however that actual collaborative governance is not developing in the petrochemical industry in the port of Rotterdam; that corporate awareness and investment in cybersecurity stay behind standards, and that cybersecurity is not included in regulatory inspections. The paper places these findings in the context of three problems often associated with 'new governance' particularly pressing in cybersecurity governance: a weak role of government in public-private collaborative arrangements; an expectation that businesses will invest in self-regulation even in the absence of incentives to do so, and a lack of information exchange. In the port of Rotterdam, these problems result in a lack of obligations and accountability pressure on petrochemical corporations, leaving on of the most important chemical industrial hazards of today, largely unregulated."
Today, incorporating advanced machine learning techniques into intrusion detection systems (IDSs) plays a crucial role in securing mobile edge computing systems. However, the mobility demands of our modern society require more advanced IDSs to make a good trade-off between coping with the rapid growth of traffic data and responding to attacks. Thus, in this paper, we propose a lightweight distributed IDS that exploits the advantages of centralized platforms to train and learn from large amounts of data. We investigate the benefits of two promising bioinspired optimization algorithms, namely Ant Lion Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization, to find the optimal data representation for the classification process. We use Deep Forest as a classifier to detect intrusive actions more robustly and generate as few false positives as possible. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can enhance the reliability of lightweight intrusion detection systems in terms of accuracy and execution time.
Legal and commercial concepts must be well coordinated in maritime sector for better efficiency of logistic chain. Maritime sector is sensitive to global market fluctuations and politics. Therefore, each component of the entire logistic chain is almost equally important. Effective ship brokering has potential and relational impacts on ship owners, importers, exporters and banking sectors. Logistic chain efficiency is based on each compartment of the system. This is also necessary to build economically robust international trading infrastructure. Among many others, fake brokering, cybercrimes and unregulations are some of the major problems faced to brokering sector in Turkey. Therefore, a quantitative decision making approach was suggested to improve brokering activities in Turkey. For this purpose, the problems in ship brokering activities in Turkey were examined and an attempt was made to determine possible solutions. The factors that are effective on current problems were examined in detail in the study and the correlations between these problems and their structure were analyzed with fuzzy DEMATEL (The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method. Furthermore, an integrated model approach was devised to address and rank the significance of the alternatives that could provide applicable solutions to the problems using the fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. Study findings demonstrated that some of the most important problems experienced in ship brokerage activities in Turkey were K7 (issues related to certification, supervision, development and authorities), K6 (informal brokerage and non-prosecution), K3 (problems experienced with foreign languages) and K5 (fake brokers and cybercrime).
Social Engineering holds one of the most critical threats to public and private organizations. In this paper we focus on phishing threats by measuring the positive impact that awareness methods may provide to them in a long-term period to companies and public bodies. The assessment criterion uses two phishing attacks in a period of 18 weeks. The phishing attack comprises a hook mail containing a link to a credentials harvesting website. Users' reaction and user agent fingerprints are used in order to calculate a risk score for each victim. By applying chi square - tests it was found that there is a statistically significant score improvement for participants that were trained via the awareness methods. Furthermore, a risk analysis is conducted to identify, quantify and prioritize potential risks that could negatively affect the end-user's operations. The main idea concerning this proposed technique is the fact that the assessment methods can assist the employees to develop skills and abilities in order to use the digital world safely, avoiding phishing attacks. The risk analysis findings indicate that the awareness approach has significant improvement in long term lasting risk reduction. The study was conducted as part of the European Horizon 2020 DOGANA project which aims to deploy effective mitigation strategies and lead to reduce the risk created by modern Social Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. The results obtained in this paper corroborate the results obtained by the EU funded project SAINT from the econometric analysis and modeling of the cybercrime and cyber security markets.
Human needs consist of five levels, which are: physiological needs, safety needs, love needs, esteem needs and self-actualization. All these needs lead to human behavior. If the environment of a person is positive, healthy behavior is developed. However, if the environment of the person is not healthy, it can be reflected in his/her behavior. Machines are intelligent enough to mimic human intelligence by using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. In the modern era, people tend to post their everyday life events on social media in the form of comments, pictures, videos, etc. Therefore, social media is a significant way of knowing certain behaviors of people such as abusive, aggressive, frustrated and offensive behaviors. Behavior detection by crawling the social media profile of a person is a crucial and important idea. The challenge of behavior detection can be sorted out by applying social media forensics on social media profiles, which involves NLP and deep learning techniques. This paper is based on the study of state of the art work on behavior detection, and based on the research, a model is proposed for behavior detection. The proposed model outperformed with an F1 score of 87% in the unigram + bigram class, and in the bigram + trigram class, it gave an F1 score of 88% when compared with models applied on state of the art work. This study is a great benefit to cybercrime and cyber-security agencies in shortlisting the profiles containing certain behaviors to prevent crimes in the future.
Over the past ten years, there has been a significant increase in computer network intrusions, partly due to a thriving black market for cybercrime and the availability of advanced tools for committing such breaches. The most effective method for stopping unwanted intrusions and identifying abnormal network behavioral patterns is an intrusion detection system (IDS). In IDS, transfer learning techniques are frequently employed. An ML-based IDS experiences problems with data imbalance and a greater false detection ratio due to a small training dataset. These ID systems can quickly and automatically recognize harmful threats. The network requires a complex security solution because dangerous threats constantly develop and appear. As a result, developing an efficient and intelligent ID system is a substantial scientific challenge. We suggested an effective ensemble strategy that improved the spotted hyena optimization algorithm (ISHO) and the honey badger algorithm (HBA) to address the data imbalance and overfitting problem. The dataset is balanced by increasing the number of data samples and the detection precision. The Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)-Deep Residual Network 152 (SE-ResNet152) approach is utilized to remove the less critical features. Every iterative phase includes using a list of decision trees, which monitor the performance of the categorizer and prevent overfitting issues. We use the datasets UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC IDS 2018, and CICIDS2019 to simulate and assess the model. Compared to other approaches, the proposed approach performs well on three datasets and obtains above 99% accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.
While the world is becoming increasingly interdependent, the countries are evermore dependent on information systems, high-speed communications and artificial intelligence. That is increasing the risks and threats to citizens' privacy, global trade, the resilient of critical infrastructure and even the readiness of the armed forces. Traditional security measures are lagging behind new challenges and they are insufficient to prevent emerging risks. The potential damage that these threats can inflict on security and economy grows tremendously, but countermeasures needs to be sophisticated and thus difficult for implementation. The 21st century instead to be the era of technologies and information revolutions is becoming of synonymous of global risks and uncertainty. This article explore the transformation of relations in cyberspace as a result of globalization and the development of information technologies, that create preconditions for new forms of criminal activity cyber-war, cyber terrorism and cybercrime. The globalization of social and political processes lead to globalization of crime, which now is transnational. Today becomes more and more obvious the need for conceptual clarity and innovative approaches in security study for cyber threats in modern society. Understanding of interconnection between globalization in cyberspace and increasing insecurity in it as a consequence of that globalization and the relation between new information technology and emerging threats coning with their use is crucial for security of our societies. The article explore cyber security as one of the biggest challenges for today's interconnected world and how to achieve it resilient development and progress.
PurposeThe purpose of this preliminary empirical research study is to understand how environmental disruption such as brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic induces shifts in organisational culture, information security culture and subsequently employee information security compliance behaviour. Design/methodology/approachA single-organisation case study was used to develop understanding from direct experiences of organisational life. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a sequential mixed methods approach, with the qualitative phase following the quantitative to achieve complementarity and completeness in analysis. For the quantitative phase, 48 useful responses were received after a questionnaire was sent to all 150-200 employees. For the qualitative phase, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted. Statistical software was used to analyse the quantitative data and NVivo software was used to analyse the qualitative data. FindingsThe pandemic-induced environmental disruption manifested as a sudden shift to work-from-home for employees, and relatedly an increase in cybercrime. The organisational response to this gave rise to shifts in both organisational and information security culture towards greater control (rule and goal orientations) and greater flexibility (support and innovation orientations), most significantly with information security culture flexibility. The net effect was an increase in employee information security compliance. Originality/valueThe vast literature on organisational culture and information security culture was drawn on to theoretically anchor and develop parsimonious measures of information security culture. Environmental disruptions such as those caused by the pandemic are unpredictable and their effects uncertain, hence, the study provides insight into the consequences of such disruption on information security in organisations.
The South African economy is not only the second largest in Africa, but it is also the most diversified, industrialized and technologically advanced on the continent. This technological advance is evidenced by its citizenry's comparatively high-level of digital connectivity and interconnectedness. On the reverse side, South Africa (SA) has the third highest number of cybercrime victims internationally. Maintaining and expanding its competitive technological advantage requires of South Africa to have a robust national cybersecurity endeavour. This needs to include an innovative, high-impact cybersecurity awareness campaign that effectively reaches a diverse population. This paper's primary aim is to propose such a high-impact drive, namely a broad-based national cybersecurity awareness campaign that levers the South African minibus taxi industry. The paper's three objectives pertain to the 'why' and 'how' of such a campaign. The paper's first objective is to substantiate the need for a broad-based cybersecurity awareness campaign (in short: why is it needed?). The second objective is to substantiate why the taxi industry constitutes an optimal platform for a game changing campaign. Thirdly, the paper advances a proposition on a Taxi Industry Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign (TICAC) (i.e. how can the taxi industry be a game changer?). We qualify the TICAC as a tentative, high-level conceptual proposition subject to much further research on the theoretical/academic and practical levels. It is hoped that the paper would be of value to also other countries - developed and developing - in utilising private and/or public transport industries as platforms for cybersecurity awareness initiatives.
In recent years, Nigeria's image has always been negatively depicted in the global media, as the country's name is associated with some of the world's most sophisticated cybercriminals. The situation with the country's perceived dented reputation, most especially in the Southeast Asia, Western Europe and the United States of America, is ripe for the anti-cybercrime discourse to take root, and subsequently, become a fertile ground for various parties to contribute to the grand discourse from different perspectives. This article highlights the way Nigerian government, through its revenues generating agency, the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), utilizes a print media warning advertisement (WA) to discursively construct and showcase its efforts in combating cybercrimes. The study utilizes Fairclough's three-layered model for approaching discourse to analyse the FIRS-sponsored WA, which was published in The Guardian newspaper on 2 May 2013. The study incorporates analytical tools from the visual grammar (VG) and the multimodal discourse analysis (MDA) to examine the visual dimensions constituting the frame of the WA. The study revealed how the Nigerian government, through the FIRS sponsored WA, has attempted to discursively draw the attention of the general public to the potential dangers associated with the cybercriminals and their activities as well as suggesting the best ways to escape falling into their traps. The study recommends that governments and other civil societies should explore other means of creating more awareness to the general public, given the speed at which cyber-related crimes upsurge globally at the present time.
"Digital business has marked an era of transformation, but also an unprecedented growth of cyber threats. While digital explosion witnessed by the banking sector since the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant, the level and frequency of cybercrimes have gone up as well. Cybercrime officials attribute it to remote working-people using home computers or laptops with vulnerable online security than office systems; malicious actors relentlessly developing their tactics to find new ways to break into enterprise networks and grasping defence evasion; persons unemployed during the pandemic getting into hacking; cloud and data corruption; digital fatigue causing negligence; etc. This study adopts a case-based approach to explore the importance of business ethics, information sharing and transparency to build an information-driven society by scouting the case of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, India. PMC defaulted on payments to its depositors and was placed under Reserve Bank of India's directions due to financial irregularities and a massive fraud perpetrated by bank officials by orchestrating the bank's IT systems. The crisis worsened when panic-stricken investors advanced their narrative through fake news peddled via social media channels, resulting in alarm that caused deaths of numerous depositors. It exposed several loopholes in information management in India's deposit insurance system and steered the policy makers to restructure the same, thus driving the country consistent with its emerging market peers. The study further identifies best practices for aligning employees towards ethical behaviour in a virtual workplace and the pedagogical approaches for information management in the new normal."
Saudi Arabia has a goal of ensuring that it has at least two cities among the top 100 smart cities of the future. However, increasing connectivity and incorporation of smart solutions in cities still raises concerns over cyber security with threats arising daily including denial of services and phishing as some of the most significant. Saudi Arabia, therefore, needs a cybersecurity policy framework that will ensure effective protection for all stakeholders in the smart city from these cyber threats. User acceptance is foremost important in any new technology, including smart-cities. Due to ongoing cyber threats and in the absence of an efficient cyber policies, Saudi end-user community is not keen to accept newer technologies where their interaction with online medium is required. The proliferation of smart cities globally affords the opportunity to analyze and compare the efforts made in Saudi Arabia with other nations like the USA, India and Singapore which is the premier smart city model in the globe currently. This review looks at the similarities and differences between KSA's cyber security policy framework with these three nations. The review will note some of the defining characteristics and approaches to cyber security in the smart cities of USA, India, and Singapore. After reviewing the current framework in Saudi Arabia, this paper will make suggestions such as updating Saudi's cybercrime legislation like in the US or formulating a master cyber security plan as seen in Singapore that will improve KSA's framework creating the best framework model for cyber security in its smart cities.
"Grown internet usage by individual and industries have also increased the attack vector in cyberspace rapidly. Botnet is a digital weapon used by attackers to commit cybercrime in stealthiest way for all type of illegal online activity. Botnet is well articulated attack responsible for many malicious activities in large volume and mass effective against any targeted organization such as confidential data theft, financial loss, distribution of pirated products, e-business extortion and network or service disruption. Because of its global nature of infection and innovative covert techniques of malware development to evade detection, it is also known as advance persistent threat. An analysis of this APT revealed the advancement in sophistication of bot malware by encryption methods, concealed network connections and silent escape as an effective tool for profit-motivated e-crime. Reverse engineering is procedure to analyze malware to classify its type, hazard, impact on machine, information outflow and removal of signature technique. Botnet (APT) detection needs improvised process to identify the channel, architecture and encryption weakness. In bot examination; Programming style, network protocol and behavior analysis can mitigate the APT by creating signature, prototype of behavior based approach and elimination of C&C servers. Reverse engineering is excellent way for defense the modern botnets to immune valuable information by identifying the evidence behavior, log collection and digital forensics. The main aim of study is to determine the most adequate approach to recreate a botnet incident. Network security is prime concern to avoid state sponsored attacks like botnet so security of digital nation and e-governance can be assured."
The COVID-19 pandemic changed the lives of millions of citizens worldwide in the manner they live and work to the so-called new norm in social standards. In addition to the extraordinary effects on society, the pandemic created a range of unique circumstances associated with cybercrime that also affected society and business. The anxiety due to the pandemic increased the probability of successful cyberattacks and as well as their number and range. For public health officials and communities, location tracking is an essential component in the efforts to combat the disease. The governments provide a lot of mobile apps to help health officials to trace the infected persons and contact them to aid and follow up on the health status, which requires an exchange of data in different forms. This paper presents the one-time stamp model as a new cryptography technique to secure different contact forms and protect the privacy of the infected person. The one-time stamp hybrid model consists of a combination of symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing cryptography in an entirely new way that is different from conventional and similar existing algorithms. Several experiments have been carried out to analyze and examine the proposed technique. Also, a comparison study has been made between our proposed technique and other state-of-the-art alternatives. Results show that the proposed one-time stamp model provides a high level of security for the encryption of sensitive data relative to other similar techniques with no extra computational cost besides faster processing time.
Non-consensual intimate image dissemination (NCII), or else better known as revenge pornography is a form of technology-facilitated sexual violence that can have devastating effects on the victim. This is one of the first studies examining how demographic characteristics (gender, sexual orientation), personality traits (Dark Tetrad), and attitudes (aggrieved entitlement, sexual entitlement, sexual image abuse myth acceptance) predict NCII perpetration and victimization. In a sample of 810 undergraduate students (72.7% female and 23.3% male), 13.7% of the participants had at some point in their life, distributed nude, or sexual pictures of someone else without consent and 28.5% had experienced such victimization. NCII perpetration was predictive of NCII victimization and vice versa. Using binomial logistic regression, we found that women, members of the LGBQ+ community, those scoring higher in sadism, and participants with a history of NCII perpetration were more likely to report that someone had distributed their nude or sexual image without consent. Further, we found that those scoring higher in narcissism and sadism, along with those with a history of NCII victimization were more likely to report they had distributed the nude or sexual image of someone else without consent. Finally, the findings suggest that the relationship between victims and perpetrators is quite a bit more varied than the term revenge pornography implies.
In recent years cyber terrorism has become increasingly used with the globalization of technology and people's access to high-speed internet. It takes place exclusively in the online environment, the advantage being that it offers an increased level of anonymity to users. Terrorist groups are targeting the misappropriation of social media accounts, focused on Distributed Denial of Service activities, exploiting communications services and banking services for fraudulent misappropriation of financial accounts. Cyberterrorism generates very high costs for the national economy, such as the involvement of specialists for detecting and correcting intrusion, declining productivity and income, costs of information theft, regaining the reputation of an institution or company, the costs relating to the resumption of production and the provision of services, the loss of information concerning intellectual property, financial manipulation using stolen information, the cost of securing computer networks and assuring them in the event of intrusion, costs generated by the time spent on recovering stolen data. In 2018 both the US and Egypt took action on these activities, the US modified its national cyber strategy and Egypt adopted the new law project to combat cybercrime. The main cyber threats they face are: threats of intrusion and sabotage of IT infrastructures, cyberterrorism and cyberwar, threats to digital identity and theft of private data, malware programs. The targets of the attacks were public sector entities, financial organizations, health care organizations, retail and accommodation. The reasons for why hackers attack these organizations are money-related, malware infected by emails, commercial and industrial espionage.
The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Android operating system have made cutting-edge technology accessible to the general public. These are affordable, easy-to-use, and open-source technology. Android devices connect to different IoT devices such as IoT-enabled cameras, Alexa powered by Amazon, and various other sensors. Due to the escalated growth of Android devices, users are facing cybercrime through their Android devices. This article aims to provide a comprehensive study of the IoT and Android systems. This article classifies different attacks on IoT and Android devices and mitigation strategies proposed by different researchers. The article emphasizes the role of the developer in secure application design. This article attempts to provide a relative analysis of several malware detection methods in the different environments of attacks. This study expands the awareness of certain application-hardening strategies applicable to IoT devices and Android applications and devices. This study will help domain experts and researchers to gain knowledge of IoT systems and Android systems from a security point of view and provide insight into how to design more efficient, robust, and comprehensive solutions. This article discusses different attack vectors and mitigation strategies available to both developers and in the open domain. Certain guidelines are also suggested for application and platform developers, as well as application databases (Google play store), to limit the risk of attack, and users can form their own defense with knowledge regarding keeping hardware and software updated and securing their system with a strong password.
In the last decade, Social Networks (SNs) have deeply changed many aspects of society, and one of the most widespread behaviours is the sharing of pictures. However, malicious users often exploit shared pictures to create fake profiles, leading to the growth of cybercrime. Thus, keeping in mind this scenario, authorship attribution and verification through image watermarking techniques are becoming more and more important. In this paper, we firstly investigate how thirteen of the most popular SNs treat uploaded pictures in order to identify a possible implementation of image watermarking techniques by respective SNs. Second, we test the robustness of several image watermarking algorithms on these thirteen SNs. Finally, we verify whether a method based on the Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) technique, which is usually used in digital forensic or image forgery detection activities, can be successfully used as a watermarking approach for authorship attribution and verification of pictures on SNs. The proposed method is sufficiently robust, in spite of the fact that pictures are often downgraded during the process of uploading to the SNs. Moreover, in comparison to conventional watermarking methods the proposed method can successfully pass through different SNs, solving related problems such as profile linking and fake profile detection. The results of our analysis on a real dataset of 8400 pictures show that the proposed method is more effective than other watermarking techniques and can help to address serious questions about privacy and security on SNs. Moreover, the proposed method paves the way for the definition of multi-factor online authentication mechanisms based on robust digital features.
Cloud computing paradigm continues to revolutionize the way business processes are being conducted through the provision of massive resources, reliability across networks and ability to offer parallel processing. However, miniaturization, proliferation and nanotechnology within devices has enabled digitization of almost every object which eventually has seen the rise of a new technological marvel dubbed Internet of Things (IoT). IoT enables self-configurable/smart devices to connect intelligently through Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), WI-FI, LAN, GPRS and other methods by further enabling timeously processing of information. Based on these developments, the integration of the cloud and IoT infrastructures has led to an explosion of the amount of data being exchanged between devices which have in turn enabled malicious actors to use this as a platform to launch various cybercrime activities. Consequently, digital forensics provides a significant approach that can be used to provide an effective postevent response mechanism to these malicious attacks in cloudbased IoT infrastructures. Therefore, the problem being addressed is that, at the time of writing this paper, there still exist no accepted standards or frameworks for conducting digital forensic investigation on cloud-based IoT infrastructures. As a result, the authors have proposed a cloud-centric framework that is able to isolate Big data as forensic evidence from IoT (CFIBD-IoT) infrastructures for proper analysis and examination. It is the authors' opinion that if the CFIBD-IoT framework is implemented fully it will support cloud-based IoT tool creation as well as support future investigative techniques in the cloud with a degree of certainty.
The consequences of Industry 4.0 have adverse side effects on cybercrime growth, which requires creating an effective cybersecurity system for companies. Therefore, this study aims to develop a composite indicator of company cybersecurity to assess its development needs. For this purpose, the authors modified Porter's method by constructing a superposition matrix based on the growth rates of cyber threats and risks, calculating their quantitative characteristics and a composite indicator. The computations are based on indicators for 2016-2022 characterizing cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the consequences of cyber threats: the share of companies experiencing one, six or more successful cyberattacks, considering the likely and very likely success of cyberattacks on them in the next 12 months, security threat and concern indices, the share of companies with a growing security budget affected by ransomware and experiencing a shortage of skilled IT security personnel, the cost of stolen or compromised credentials. As a result, cybersecurity needs increased significantly for 2020-2022, mainly due to digital transformation and the cyber threats growth after the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparative analysis of the proposed indicator with those characterizing the development of Industry 4.0 showed that the need for a reliable cybersecurity system is much more important than the active development of modern technologies. Spending on IT is also increasing, but not enough to meet the needs of cybersecurity development, except for the 2022 results. The proposed indicator is defined for companies worldwide, but its versatility allows the methodology to be applied to enterprises of various industries and sizes.
The rise in internet users has brought with it the impending threat of cybercrime as the Internet of Things (IoT) increases and the introduction of 5G technologies continues to transform our digital world. It is now essential to protect communication networks from illegal intrusions to guarantee data integrity and user privacy. In this situation, machine learning techniques used in data mining have proven to be effective tools for constructing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and improving their precision. We use the well-known AWID3 dataset, a comprehensive collection of wireless network traffic, to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing network security. Our work primarily concentrates on Krack and Kr00k attacks, which target the most recent and dangerous flaws in IEEE 802.11 protocols. Through diligent implementation, we were able to successfully identify these threats using an IDS model that is based on machine learning. Notably, the resilience of our method was demonstrated by our ensemble classifier's astounding 99% success rate in detecting the Krack attack. The effectiveness of our suggested remedy was further demonstrated by the high accuracy rate of 96.7% displayed by our neural network-based model in recognizing instances of the Kr00k attack. Our research shows the potential for considerably boosting network security in the face of new threats by leveraging the capabilities of machine learning and a diversified dataset. Our findings open the door for stronger, more proactive security measures to protect IEEE. 802.11 networks' integrity, resulting in a safer online environment for all users.
e-Wallets and m-banking apps became more and more popular in the developed world, approaching a point of tipping. This can be due to the global use of big and small merchants of paying equipment and the ubiquity of e-wallet and m-banking apps adoption. Many consumers are using e-wallets and m-banking apps that can be an effective cybercrime option. e-Wallets and m-banking apps allow financial transactions via smartphones that give cybercriminals a lucrative opportunity. Mobile technology has become increasingly mainstream and continually strengthening, with the focus on mobile apps protection and forensic analysis developing. In this paper, the security aspect of five popular e-wallets in Malaysia were analyzed. This paper also provides a security analysis of another five leading m-banking apps. The security analysis is based on a security principle that is recommended by Open Web Application Security (OWASP) under Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) and Mobile Security Threats (MST). The static analysis has been done by using three mobile application-testing tools. This study included a variation of vulnerability scanning, code review and, most significantly, penetration testing. Each app complied with the security requirement, but their security features and characteristics, such as encryption, security protocols, and app services, are different to each other. This study was carried out using a DELL computer with Intel Core i7 CPU, 3.40 GHz CPU, 6 GB RAM. Finally, the results revealed the secure e-wallet and m-banking apps among the selected apps.
We live in an information society in which development occurs rapidly. Digitalization affects all aspects of society, cutting through all societal functions. Digital platforms make it possible to match demands on things and services and deliver them at a lower cost. Automatization and robotics affect demand for manual operations and workers. Moreover, working life is changing, as it increasingly utilizes an emerging complementary relationship between machines and people. Needs for more knowledge and skills also arise. This article provides a preliminary plan as to how and in what respects the issue of information security might be incorporated into university teachers' expertise. For example, in distance learning-a form of education distribution requiring computer equipment that is to be provided by the student-information security is crucial. From the educator's point of view, student identification-in connection with exams, for example-is obviously critical. Digital on-campus exams are another pertinent theme, entailing many opportunities for doing things in new or better ways in comparison with paper exams and the time-consuming administration they involve. New questions arise, however. Certain aspects of information and communication technology entail risks-such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks, cybercrime, and sabotage in general. This article will discuss the need for university teachers to be prepared to respond adequately and effectively to information security issues. Examples are given showing how the University of Boras approaches security considerations. A preliminary analysis of the need to include information security in the general knowledge required of all university teachers in the era of eLearning is given.
In the network security cybercrime technologies have brought many good things by means of the internet: electronic commerce, easy access to vast stores of reference material, collaborative computing, e-mail, and new avenues for advertising and information distribution, to name a few. As with most technological advances, there is also a other side: criminal hackers. Governments, companies, and private citizens around the world are anxious to be a part of this revolution, but they are afraid that some hacker will break into their Web server and replace their logo with pornography, read their e-mail, steal their credit card number from an online shopping site, or implant software that will secretly transmit their organization's secrets to the open Internet. With these concerns and others, the ethical hacker can help. This paper describes ethical hackers: their skills, their attitudes, and how they go about helping their customers find and plug up security holes. Hacking is the word that shakes everyone whenever it is said or heard by someone. Everyone born in this world with attitude wants to be a Hacker. But it is not a job of a new born baby or an old grown lady. A Hacker needs a brilliant mind to hack anything. There are many rules that he should learn to become an Ethical Hacker which is also called as penetrate testing. These rules include knowledge of HTML, Java Scripts, Computer Tricks, Cracking & Breaking etc. etc. In this paper I explain about the hacking techniques and the functions of how it takes place in the network and the methods to be solved.
Lato sensu when we encounter in treatises on harmony the notion of octaves and parallel/anti-parallel or direct fifths, we find out that these movements of the voices in the tonal-functional harmony are as a rule prohibited for a number of reasons. Alexandru Pascanu motivated these interdictions related to the parallel fifths as follows the reason for this categorical interdiction does not reside in the fact that it sounds bad (as they say), but rather in a stylistic imperative. The parallel fifths, reminiscences of the primitive polyphonic forms, create a modal atmosphere that contradicts the tonal ambience. The challenge in this article consists in making a parallel between the rules of harmony, of voice leading, that we musicians know only too well, and those other rules - the rules of law (applicable in cyberspace) - which could be very concisely defined as: those general and abstract rules that regulate the conduct of law subjects in their legal relationships or simply the rules of social conduct or morals. Using transposition and focusing on the rules that address the active or passive participants in cyberspace, we shall be able to identify a series of rules/norms that govern this electronic realm, and implicitly, reveal a range of illicit conducts, as a consequence of the breach of these rules by users. The availability and accessibility of the Internet have brought about personal and social changes. There has been an important increase in the number of human activities that have moved face-to-face encounters from the physical space into cyberspace through online activities - particularly during this pandemic - and these new habits are slowly changing customs, practices, priorities, governing, and even human culture. In cyberspace people behave in a manner that requires new concepts in psychology, as well as in the realm of national, European, and international law, which require the use of old psychological knowledge, as well as the articulation of new ideas in order to understand and explain the human behaviour in cyberspace.
"Introduction: The growing offer of products and services in a virtual environment resulted in a significant increase in the volume of personal and organizational data that transit through data networks and are stored in different places, by different entities. Interactions in this environment are continuously monitored, whether for needs related to the interests of companies or organizations, or to curb the most diverse illicit practices. These monitoring activities, which configure a state of permanent vigilance, raise concerns related to the treatment of data collected and processed, with important ethical and legal implications, and which may not be properly covered by legal instruments. Objective: The research sought to identify which studies published between 2010 and 2020 deal with ethical or legal issues related to privacy in the virtual environment. Methodology: A literature review was carried out, adopting content analysis as a technique. As a technological resource, Excel & REG; and ATLAS.TI & REG; software were used. Results: Only 19 of the 39 documents found are in line with the research objective, most of which are theses and dissertations. Publications are concentrated in the second half of the analyzed period. Conclusion: The analyses showed a growing need to monitor the information circulating in the virtual environment, involving sender and receiver, covering security issues, increased volume of data, new technologies, and cybercrime among other issues. The number and distribution of articles over the analyzed period indicate that these themes require even greater investigations, contemplating broader perspectives of monitoring activities in virtual environments."
The aim of the paper is to analyse the likely implications of Generative AI (GAI) on various aspects of business and the economy. Amid the rapid growth and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve-from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may provide quality service-such as copywriting-to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models-specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge. Not only the obvious expert-level data scientist roles but also low grade, model supervisors-people training the models, assessing the quality of responses given and handling escalations. Lastly new cybercrime risks emerging from the rise of GAI are discussed.
Background and Purpose: The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked global challenges, economic disruption, and an increase in related crimes, such as scams, fraud, and cybercrime. It has also changed the routines of individuals, businesses, and governments in combating financial crimes, especially professional accountants. As front-liners in the anti-money laundering (AML) regime, professional accountants play a vital role in combating financial crime, including money laundering activities that have risen during the pandemic. However, limited study has investigated the money laundering reporting framework for the professional accountants. Hence, this study aims to investigate the money laundering framework for professional accountants that suits the post-pandemic period. Methodology: This study conducted a content analysis, focussing on the current red flags for money laundering activities specifically for the professional accountants mentioned in prior literature and publicly available reports such as Financial Action Task Force (FATF), ICAEW and ACCA Global. Since this study focuses on the money laundering framework for the professional accountants, this study also referred to the MIA Competency Framework that highlights the importance of professional scepticism and professional judgement. Findings: Findings showed that professional accountants must exercise high professional scepticism and judgement when dealing with money laundering risk indicators related to related party transactions, beneficial ownership and e-commerce activities. This is to provide quality reporting to the authorities and to proceed with money laundering investigations. Contributions: This study will contribute to the regulators and professional accountant by proposing a money laundering framework for the professional accountants that would assist them in fulfilling their role as money laundering reporting entity.
Cybercrime affects companies worldwide, costing millions of dollars annually. The constant increase of threats and vulnerabilities raises the need to handle vulnerabilities in a prioritized manner. This prioritization can be achieved through Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), typically used to assign a score to a vulnerability. However, there is a temporal mismatch between the vulnerability finding and score assignment, which motivates the development of approaches to aid in this aspect. We explore the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in CVSS score prediction given vulnerability descriptions. We start by creating a vulnerability dataset from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Then, we combine text pre-processing and vocabulary addition to improve the model accuracy and interpret its prediction reasoning by assessing word importance, via Shapley values. Experiments show that the combination of Lemmatization and 5,000-word addition is optimal for DistilBERT, the outperforming model in our experiments of the NLP methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, specific events (such as an attack on a known software) tend to influence model prediction, which may hinder CVSS prediction. Combining Lemmatization with vocabulary addition mitigates this effect, contributing to increased accuracy. Finally, binary classes benefit the most from pre-processing techniques, particularly when one class is much more prominent than the other. Our work demonstrates that DistilBERT is a state-of-the-art model for CVSS prediction, demonstrating the applicability of deep learning approaches to aid in vulnerability handling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Joana-Cabral/CVSS_Prediction.
The objective of this paper, flowing from an active post-graduates research program, is to provide a best practice strategy framework for developing countries to secure cyberspace, taking cognisance of the realities and constraints within a developing milieu. Cybersecurity policies and related strategies are required for developing countries in order to effectively safeguard against cyber related threats (the same as for developed countries). These policies and strategies for developing countries will differ from those of developed countries due to the unique realities within a developing world. Africa in specific is presently seen as a hotbed for cybercrime, and one of the reasons is that many African countries do not have a proper framework, policies and procedures to properly protect cyberspace. Experience has also shown that a pure adoption by developing countries of the cyber frameworks of developed nations will not always be effective, especially due to the unique requirements and realities within developing worlds, such as limited resources, infrastructure, technologies, skills and experience. The approach taken for the research program, and discussed in this paper, is based on a comprehensive literature study on several existing cybersecurity policies and strategies from both developed and developing countries. From this the drivers / elements for national cybersecurity policies and strategies were identified. These drivers were than adapted to specifically relate to the requirements of developing countries, and then, utilising the identified and adapted drivers, our best practice strategy framework for developing countries to secure their cyberspace was developed. This document will be very useful for those African countries venturing into defining relevant policies and procedures.
Since February 2022, the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict significantly impacted the digital landscape. This study examines the conflict's impacts on the local and global digital ecosystem. Using grey literature, we analyzed English-language data sources primarily published between November 2022 and April 2023, which were based on data sources from the commencement of the conflict to the publication date. The investigation reveals insights into four categories: cyber and kinetic warfare, telecommunications, IT and cloud computing, digital geopolitics and resilience. The main insight in cyber warfare is that cyber attacks on Ukraine's digital infrastructure were only partially effective despite the massive involvement of cybercrime groups implementing adaptive wiping and DDoS attacks on behalf of national interests. The cyber defense success resulted from the allies' support for Ukraine and a well-established and implemented national cybersecurity strategy. Kinetic attacks against data centers have accelerated the migration of data and applications to cloud computing. The most incredible legacy of the current conflict is the positive paradigm shift in the cloud's security and privacy capabilities for sensitive systems' continuous operation as an alternative to system disability in locally destroyed data centers. The third insight reveals Telecom's reliance on satellite network suppliers and mobile power equipment, such as High-Capacity batteries, which are in shortage worldwide. Digital geopolitics alters the paradigms of digital resilience. Global tech companies assume the role of digital nations and superpowers while taking sides. During the conflict, we observe for the first time in practice the digital blockade by global techies of one side of the conflict and the digital support of the other, thereby shaping paradigms regarding digital sovereignty as digital resilience.
Cyberbullying is a type of cybercrime that has become a new phenomenon, rapidly increasing on the cyberspace, as it utilizes the Internet technology to harass people, especially among teenagers and youth on online learning platforms. This study aimed to analyze the factors influencing LGBTQ cyberbullying on online learning platforms among university students in Thailand. A quantitative research design was used to collect data from 400 university students in Thailand through questionnaires. The data were analyzed through a structural equation model. The results found that most Thai students had a low level of cyberbullying behavior, as they respected each other, especially LGBTQ students. Moreover, there were three major factors comprising demographics, the situation, and online learning platform behavior that had a significant direct effect on the outcome of LGBTQ cyberbullying victims. The demographic factors (gender, motivation, psychology, and technology using behavior) had a direct effect on the situation factors (perceived support, parental involvement, and university climate and environment), and a direct effect on online learning platform factors (teachers, classmates, dialog of online learning, group work, and relationship between classmates and the teacher). Moreover, the LGBTQ online learning platform factor had a direct effect on the outcome of cyberbullying (social equality, mindset, intellect, physical, and society). The relative Chi-square (chi 2 / df) of 1.194 indicated that the model was suitable. The comparative fit index (CFI) was 0.991, the goodness of fit index (GFI) was 0.971, and the model based on the research hypothesis was consistent with the empirical data. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.022.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are well-known for their privacy properties that allow for the anonymous exchange of money. Bitcoin tracking with taint analysis remains challenging as it does not account for the change in Bitcoins' ownership or the usage of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to obscure Bitcoins' movement, and often produces unessential incidents with transactions unlikely to be related to the targeted activity. In this paper, we propose to improve the Bitcoin taint analysis tracking process that adapts to the context of address ownership and avoid following unrelated transactions. First, we introduce an approach in which we incorporate Bitcoin taint analysis with address profiling. Second, we propose two context-based taint analysis strategies. Third, we introduce a set of metrics using hypothesised behaviours related to illegal Bitcoins and recognisable patterns within the blockchain. We conducted an experiment using sample data from known Bitcoin theft cases to illustrate and evaluate the approach. The results on address profile integration reveal distinct transaction behaviours in tracking theft cases following all the metrics, such as address reuse, address size and transaction fee payment. One of the context-based tracking strategies, Dirty-First, shows positive potential for illustrating illegal Bitcoins' spending and obscuring strategies. The majority of the six metrics we defined give distinct results in transaction behaviours between the theft cases and the control groups. Our context-based tracking methodology provides a solution for one of the shortcomings in the current Bitcoin tracking methodology and the next step for future cryptocurrency and cybercrime forensic research.

The announced problems did not arise today from scratch. It seemed that in modern society, with its developed system of hygiene, medicine, sanitary and epidemiological measures for the prevention of diseases (prevention, vaccination, etc.), the mass and uncontrolled spread of dangerous infectious diseases that covered not only local areas, but and entire countries, remained only in the memories of the distant past. But! As it turned out, the existing means of control were not enough, and now a new coronavirus with the code name - COVID-19 is rapidly spreading around the world and the spread of which is determined by the WHO pandemic. One of the measures to combat the spread of the virus was the isolation of citizens and, accordingly, a decrease of their activity. But the activity of criminals has not decreased - on the contrary, new circumstances give them the opportunity to more effectively carry out their actions. Therefore, the development of a typical psychological (criminalistic) portrait of a criminal with a conditional name quarantine, seems relevant and promising. Against the backdrop of outbreaks of coronavirus, more and more people do not part with medical masks, respirators. Although the mask provides some protection against infection, it significantly complicates the process of biometric authentication, which complicates the work of even artificial intelligence technologies.
Online users have completely changed the initial concept of social networks and how they have been perceived in recent years. Online Social Networks (OSNs) have completely changed in form, scope and nature, by the way Internet users create, view, share, present and/or use information. As a result, many vulnerabilities have emerged and the security threats, attacks, and malware of OSNs continue to increase because malicious or malevolent users commonly referred to, as 'attackers' often take advantage of the inferred trust relationships inherent in social networking to promote cybercrimes. This paper aims to investigate commonly used approaches to malware propagation on online social network systems, by examining their attack vectors and present a qualitative review of the findings. The study shows that online social networks are still vulnerable to Cross site scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking attacks. We further show that Clickjacking using malware URL links is still the dominant source of malware propagation on online social networks. Finally, we propose areas for further research used to stem the use of OSNs as a medium for malware distribution.
The term 'data', ubiquitous in the Digital Age, etymologically refers to a piece of information 'given' (datum). In this article, I argue that the term 'capta' would be more accurate, since information is often taken from us. Capturing information replicates normative elements of abuse, surveillance, control and harm becoming central and problematic within the emergence of the 'onlife'. I illustrate my argument via an ethnomethodological consideration of my attempt to resist the unwilling capture of personal information. Since 2016, I have engaged in what I call an 'offlife' existence, phasing out all devices and platforms that covertly capture personal data. However, my experiment has proven problematic, impractical and has even been perceived as being anti-social, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the conclusion of this article, I consider the problematics of engaging in some form of resistance to data collection.
It has recently been discovered that large companies and nations observe their customers and citizens, disregarding any remaining moral and technological lines, being able to listen to telephone conversations and monitoring communications, through powerful monitoring and surveillance programs. Elsewhere on the planet, nations in turmoil or wrapped in a cloak of censorship persecute their citizens, controlling them by denying them access to the free Web without the threat of repercussions that threatens their dignity To support the present research, an analysis of platforms that allow anonymous and secure browsing and a study of technologies and programs with potential privacy breach and computer intrusion were performed. The main objective of this work was to analyse the computer monitoring and surveillance technologies, identifying the available tools, trying to find potential solutions, developing and providing a methodology that enhances any desktop, server or mobile operating system, with characteristics that combat the exposed in this summary.

The paper discusses means to identify potential impacts of data flows on customers' security, and privacy during online payments. The main objectives of our research are looking into the evolution of cybercrime new trends of online payments and detection, more precisely the usage of mobile phones, and describing methodologies for digital trace identification in data flows for potential online payment fraud. The paper aims to identify potential actions for identity theft while conducting the Reconnaissance step of the kill chain, and documenting a forensic methodology for guidance and further data collection for law enforcement bodies. Moreover, a secondary objective of the paper is to identify, from a user's perspective, transparency issues of data sharing among involved parties for online payments. We thus declare the transparency analysis as the incident triggering a forensic examination. Hence, we devise a semi-automated traffic analysis approach, based on previous work, to examine data flows, and data exchanged among parties in online payments. For this, the main steps are segmenting traffic generated by the process payment, and other sources, subsequently, identifying data streams in the process. We conduct three tests which include three different payment gateways: PayPal, Klarna-sofort, and Amazon Pay. The experiment setup requires circumventing TLS encryption for the correct identification of forensic data types in TCP/IP traffic, and potential data leaks. However, it requires no extensive expertise in mobile security for its installation. In the results, we identified some important security vulnerabilities from some payment APIs that pose financial and privacy risks to the marketplace's customers.
Increasing demand for digital evidence in criminal investigations is driving decentralization of forensic capabilities closer to the crime scene. Law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep pace with technological developments, cybercrime growth, and scientific advances. In federated environments, digital forensic knowledge and practices vary widely across regions. To reduce delays, wasted resources, missed opportunities, mistakes, and misinterpretations, there is a pressing need to balance the democratization of digital forensic capabilities with knowledge management and sharing between decentralized regions. There are multiple forms of knowledge to be managed, including procedural, technical, investigative, scientific, behavioral, crime analysis, and forensic intelligence. In addition, there are multiple knowledge producers and consumers, including police investigators, digital forensic practitioners, criminal intelligence analysts, attorneys, and judges. Knowledge management becomes even more challenging when multiple interdependent regions are involved, speaking different languages. Taking all of these factors into consideration, this work presents an inter-regional knowledge management solution for improving the quality, consistency, reliability, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and return on investment of digital forensic capabilities. The basis of this work is a community-driven initiative of Swiss regional police authorities. Interviews were conducted with 15 digital forensic units to determine their current knowledge management practices and needs. The results were then generalized into a prioritized set of requirements for inter-regional digital forensic knowledge management that may be applicable in other countries. These requirements were used to evaluate knowledge management platforms, and one was selected. Implementation, operations, and maintenance challenges of an inter-regional digital forensic knowledge management platform are discussed.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to decipher the law relating to cybercrimes regulation and benchmarking best practices that could be adopted to address regulatory weaknesses in some countries. In many countries, cybercrimes regulation is undermined by a lack of robust regulatory regimes. The few regimes that are available are fragmented with no coherent global strategy to deal with these offences across countries and regions. There is a lot of scholarly literature to corroborate the fact that lack of requisite laws on cyber and financial crimes has rendered states lame ducks when faced with well-organized and resourced criminal organizations. Design/methodology/approach This paper articulates intricacies of regulating money laundering and cybercrimes using data from selected African countries and beyond. Generic issues on financial crimes, cybercrimes, case law and policy documents drawn from different jurisdictions have been examined based on the objectives of the study. Cybercrime activities and anti-money laundering (AML) regulatory models have been evaluated drawing on experiences of selected countries in Africa and other countries. Questions whether suspicious activity reports are appropriate as a model to counter incidences of cybercrime activities or whether other options should be considered were also examined. Most notably, the risk-based assessment model such as profiling of high-risk clients rather than reporting every transaction will be compared and possibly suggested as a suitable alternative in financial crimes regulation. The authors have evaluated the data and AML regulatory approaches and other policy measures to curtail the foregoing threats. There is a possibility that AML tools used by financial institutions and banking activities could be used to prevent the growing threat of cybercrimes. The paper has also been enriched by case studies of tenuous legal systems and fragmentation of laws on cybercrimes and financial crimes and how these gaps have been exploited to fuel incidences of illicit criminal activities around the globe. The paper has also used empirical data including visits to banks and financial institutions on the nexus between the threat of cybercrimes and money laundering prevention. The authors have been selective, evaluating cases from 2000s to date. This timeline was particularly important because of the increased incidences of computers and money laundering threats globally. After analysing the data, the authors were able to delineate that there is a close connection between the foregoing two crimes, how they operate in practice, differences and similarities in the counter-measures used to mitigate their negative effect globally. Thus, in the authors' contention, this is a novel study that is likely to spur farther research on law and policy against cyber and AML crimes not only in Uganda but also in other jurisdictions. At the same time, the findings of the study could complement, and perhaps also complete, the work of scholars who have written papers on cybercrimes to advocate for regulatory changes fight against these offences. The study will also complement the work of other researchers who have challenged the segregation of cybercrimes and financial crimes in local and international regulatory discourses. This research aims to make a significant contribution to the study of cybercrimes and how they are regulated in international law. Findings The findings of the paper have confirmed that the high incidences of money laundering and cybercrimes today are partly fuelled by inherent weaknesses in the global regulatory system and partly fuelled by weaknesses at an individual state level. Many countries have enacted a raft of anti-cyber and AML legislation but this notwithstanding, these laws have not been used to stem cross-border crimes globally. This is partly explained by the fact that many enforcement institutions lack the requisite capacity to institute measures through which to implement engendered laws and policies easily. The regulatory capacity of many countries has been eviscerated by deficiencies in infrastructure and systems.
Cyber threats are attempts to secure unauthorized access to, change, or delete private information, to demand money from victims, or to disrupt business. Cybercrime includes everything from identity theft, malware threats, email and online fraud, to bank fraud. Businesses and individuals use this method to guard their data centers and other digital systems. The lack of scalability, sluggish response times, and inability to spot advanced and insider threats are among some of the problems with conventional approaches to network security. These flaws highlight the need for research to build more efficient and all-encompassing security methods to guard against the expanding variety of network attacks. Cybercriminals use AI and data poisoning, as well as model theft strategies to automate their attacks. A cyber security technique based on artificial intelligence is presented in this study for financial sector management (CS-FSM). In order to map and prevent unexpected risks from devouring a business, artificial intelligence is one of the best technologies. Using the proposed technique, cyberattack problems can be classified and solved. To ensure the security of financial sector information, algorithms such as the Enhanced Encryption Standard (EES) encrypt and decrypt data. By learning from the training data, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm produces predictions. In the financial sector, it is used to detect and stop malware attacks. The proposed method increases cyber security systems' performance by increasing their defense against cyberattacks. CS-FSM enhances data privacy (18.3%), scalability (17.2%), risk reduction (13.2%), data protection (16.2%), and attack avoidance (11.2%) ratios.
Digital forensic examinations have grown in breadth and depth at a currently unsustainable rate. Digital Investigations now feature in around 90% of criminal cases, demonstrating that digital evidence is crucial to forensic investigations. Due to the high number of cases, most law enforcement units have significant backlogs of devices waiting for analysis. As the field of Digital Investigation has grown, it is no longer solely related to criminal investigations, with the techniques also supporting civil, private, and corporate activities. Given the evident challenges, it is logical that more digital forensic experts are needed to keep pace with the field's complexities and demands. Identifying what characteristics and skills make a digital forensic expert enables an evaluation to ensure that any new staff are fit for purpose. There is a growth in academic, civil, corporate, and intelligence-based activity within the field. Each area defines their standards, field scope, and expertise level. Still, as any case has the potential to become a matter of criminal investigation, surely the focus needs to be on the standards required to ensure evidence is admissible for that purpose. As expertise levels can vary, it is also necessary to challenge the level at which an expert is defined and the implications of this decision. By identifying what makes an expert in this unique forensic science area, it is possible to explore the potential challenges the field faces in obtaining, retaining, and training staff.

Over the last decade, userland memory forensics techniques and algorithms have gained popularity among practitioners, as they have proven to be useful in real forensics and cybercrime investigations. These techniques analyze and recover objects and artifacts from process memory space that are of critical importance in investigations. Nonetheless, the major drawback of existing techniques is that they cannot determine the origin and context within which the recovered object exists without prior knowledge of the application logic. Thus, in this research, we present a solution to close the gap between application-specific and application-generic techniques. We introduce OAGen, a post-execution and app-agnostic semantic analysis approach designed to help investigators establish concrete evidence by identifying the provenance and relationships between in-memory objects in a process memory image. OAGen utilizes Points-to analysis to reconstruct a runtime's object allocation network. The resulting graph is then fed as an input into our semantic analysis algorithms to determine objects' origin, context, and scope in the network. The results of our experiments exhibit OAGen's ability to effectively create an allocation network even for memory-intensive applications with thousands of objects, like Facebook. The performance evaluation of our approach across fourteen different Android apps shows OAGen can efficiently search and decode nodes, and identify their references with a modest throughput rate. Further practical application of OAGen demonstrated in two case studies shows that our approach can aid investigators in the recovery of deleted messages and the detection of malware functionality in post-execution program analysis.
The advent of new media has opened up opportunities and space for youths to conduct business online. Nowadays, online shopping has become one of the main activities for Internet users because it saves an individual's time and energy. Although this modern technology provides various benefits, from another point of view it can pose a threat to Internet users, especially youths such as becoming victims of online fraud. The issue of fraudulent purchases of goods online is becoming more alarming. It is increasingly happening when the country faces the Covid-19 pandemic where the use of e-commerce is increasing among the people. A holistic effort needs to be made to view, address and curb the issues of buying goods online among youths. In this context, the knowledge and practices of consumers are vital so that they will not become victims of cybercrime. Therefore, this study aims to identify the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices of youths towards information privacy and security of online purchases. This study uses a quantitative approach in which a total of 400 respondents in Klang, Selangor have answered a questionnaire on the issue of online purchasing. The results of the study found that privacy and information security issues influence the attitudes and practices of youths when making online purchases. This proves that youths who have the knowledge and awareness are able to protect them from becoming victims of cyber crime and in turn are able to face the risks of online purchases.
"Online shopping has become increasingly popular as a result of various shopping apps which are easy to use and allow users to search, explore and purchase products using their smart phones. High usage of mobile phones by millennials has resulted in an increased activity on online platforms. However, the growth of e-commerce and online transactions have also brought with it the risks of cybercrime, which has resulted in causing anxiety to online customers. Online identity theft is a mounting problem that affects individuals all over the world. Identity theft is becoming common; about 1 in 15 adults became victims of identity fraud in the year 2017 (Bellemare, 2019) and the fear of victimization has also increased with one in five victims of identity theft having experienced it more than once. Despite the growing fear of victimization discouraging online shopping, it is still growing and is considered as a preferred method by the young generation. The present study explores the determinants of online shopping and assesses the impact of fear of victimization as a mediating variable between online shopping determinants and online shopping tendency. The results of the study indicate that there is no relationship between the attitude of the consumer with online shopping tendency. The results of the study also report a negative effect of the perceived risk on the consumer's shopping tendency. However, trust was found to have an impact on online shopping tendency. The mediating effect of fear of victimization was evident in the study."
The main goal of our research was to evaluate the need of elderly computer users for special training on cybersecurity. The article highlights the results of our study which deals with the elderly and their information practices. We used 268 questionnaires from Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Denmark and Sweden. Only members of social organizations were included in the sample. It was important to find out whether pensioners use the Internet and what for. It turned out that the spectrum of used features is quite narrow. On the other hand, there is also an increase of using Internet for public services, for paying for goods and other services. The data of this study was based on the analysis of the annual Norton Report 2013 and typical cyber crime cases where pensioners were victims. So this data led us to the conclusion about high risk of ICT use among elderly, which also accompanies opportunities for them. Governments in most European countries and the European Commission are making great efforts in the fight against cybercrime. But elderly people are not regarded as a potential risk group in the existing cybersecurity strategies. The analysis of computer literacy training programs for elderly people led us to the conclusion that cybersecurity issues are not considered or considered in a very small amount in this kind of programs. The results of our research allowed us to identify common problem areas for all countries participating in the study. The analysis showed the need of specialized training course on cyber security for the elderly and also the guidelines for its conduct.
Authorship verification is a crucial process employed to determine the authorship of a given text by analyzing distinct aspects of the writer's style, such as vocabulary, syntax, and punctuation. This process has gained significant research attention in various domains, including intellectual property rights, plagiarism detection, cybercrime investigations, copyright infringement, and forensics. While extensive studies have been conducted on multiple languages worldwide, encompassing Western European languages like Italian and Spanish, as well as Asian languages such as Bengali and Chinese, the investigation of authorship verification in Urdu has been comparatively limited, despite its status as a prominent South Asian language. This limitation can be attributed to the intricate and distinctive morphology of Urdu, which necessitates specific methodologies that cannot be directly applied in the same manner as other languages. To bridge this gap, we propose an innovative approach for authorship verification in Urdu, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with three distinct hyper-tuned parameters: ADAM, SGD, and RMSProp. To facilitate the development of this approach, we have curated a new corpus called UAVC-22, specifically tailored for Urdu authorship verification. This corpus offers enhanced robustness in terms of authors' classes and unique words. We have developed 9 authorship verification models, utilizing three different text embedding techniques, namely Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, we have performed a comparative analysis with traditional machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest to assess the superiority and efficacy of the CNN-based approach. The optimized CNN-ADAM model with FastText achieved the highest accuracy of 98% for the Urdu dataset UAVC-22.
"Introduction: The growing offer of products and services in a virtual environment resulted in a significant increase in the volume of personal and organizational data that transit through data networks and are stored in different places, by different entities. Interactions in this environment are continuously monitored, whether for needs related to the interests of companies or organizations, or to curb the most diverse illicit practices. These monitoring activities, which configure a state of permanent vigilance, raise concerns related to the treatment of data collected and processed, with important ethical and legal implications, and which may not be properly covered by legal instruments. Objective: The research sought to identify which studies published between 2010 and 2020 deal with ethical or legal issues related to privacy in the virtual environment. Methodology: A literature review was carried out, adopting content analysis as a technique. As a technological resource, Excel & REG; and ATLAS.TI & REG; software were used. Results: Only 19 of the 39 documents found are in line with the research objective, most of which are theses and dissertations. Publications are concentrated in the second half of the analyzed period. Conclusion: The analyses showed a growing need to monitor the information circulating in the virtual environment, involving sender and receiver, covering security issues, increased volume of data, new technologies, and cybercrime among other issues. The number and distribution of articles over the analyzed period indicate that these themes require even greater investigations, contemplating broader perspectives of monitoring activities in virtual environments."
Digital evidence is critical in cybercrime investigations because it is used to connect individuals to illegal activity. Digital evidence is complicated, diffuse, volatile, and easily altered, and as such, it must be protected. The Chain of Custody (CoC) is a critical component of the digital evidence procedure. The aim of the CoC is to demonstrate that the evidence has not been tampered with at any point throughout the investigation. Because the uncertainty associated with digital evidence is not being assessed at the moment, it is impossible to determine the trustworthiness of CoC. As scientists, forensic examiners have a responsibility to reverse this tendency and officially confront the uncertainty inherent in any evidence upon which they base their judgments. To address these issues, this article proposes a new paradigm for ensuring the integrity of digital evidence (CoC documents). The new paradigm employs fuzzy hash within blockchain data structure to handle uncertainty introduced by error-prone tools when dealing with CoC documents. Traditional hashing techniques are designed to be sensitive to small input modifications and can only determine if the inputs are exactly the same or not. By comparing the similarity of two images, fuzzy hash functions can determine how different they are. With the symmetry idea at its core, the suggested framework effectively deals with random parameter probabilities, as shown in the development of the fuzzy hash segmentation function. We provide a case study for image forensics to illustrate the usefulness of this framework in introducing forensic preparedness to computer systems and enabling a more effective digital investigation procedure.
Cybercrime is a growing and worrisome problem, particularly when it involves minors. Cyberaggression among adolescents in particular can result in negative legal and psychological consequences for people involved. Therefore, it is important to have instruments to detect these incidents early and understand the problem to propose effective measures for prevention and treatment. This paper aims to design a new self-report, the Cyber-Aggression Questionnaire for Adolescents (CYBA), to evaluate the extent to which the respondent conducts aggressions through a mobile phone or the internet and analyse the factorial and criterion validity and reliability of their scores in a sample of adolescents from Asturias, Spain. The CYBA was administered to 3,148 youth aged between 12 and 18 years old along with three self-reports to measure aggression at school, impulsivity, and empathy. Regarding factorial validity, the model that best represents the structure of the CYBA consists of three factors (Impersonation, Visual-sexual Cyber-aggression, and Verbal Cyber-aggression and Exclusion) and four additional indicators of Visual Cyber-aggression-Teasing/Happy Slapping. Regarding criterion validity, the score on the CYBA correlates positively with aggression at school and impulsivity and negatively with empathy. That is the way cyber-aggression correlates with these three variables, according to previous empirical evidence. The reliability of the scores on each item and factor of the CYBA are adequate. Therefore, the CYBA offers a valid and reliable measure of cyber-aggression in adolescents. (C) 2016 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.
"The easy accessibility of stored data on the cloud storage with the use of wide range of digital devices offers both the economic and technical opportunities to its subscribers. These benefits can also be exploited by malicious users to carry out illegal activities. When such illegal activities (cybercrimes) are carried out, it is essential for digital forensic investigators to identify the malicious usages, the dynamics of the crime, identify the perpetrators or the individuals behind the crime, reconstruct the crime patterns, interpret the criminal activities and charge the personalities involved to the court of law. The sustainability of digital forensics depends on the use of appropriate technology to curb various forms of cybercrimes. During forensic investigation artificial intelligence techniques and the use of appropriate forensic tools play important roles to detect activities related to cybercrime. One of the technical challenges associated with cloud forensics investigation is the inability of forensic investigators to obtain raw data from the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) as a result of privacy issue; this necessitates the need for client forensics. The aim of this paper is to propose a model based on traceability technique to illustrate how the extracted digital artifacts from Windows 10 and an android smartphone can be mapped and linked to the cloud storage accessed and to illustrate the patterns of the activities with 5Ws1H-based expression (what, who, where, when, why and how). The model is set out to assist forensic investigators to easily identify, track and reconstruct a post-event timeline of the activities that takes place on cloud storage with the use of client devices and thereby saves time and enhances better visualization of the crime patterns."
Phishing is the easiest way to use cybercrime with the aim of enticing people to give accurate information such as account IDs, bank details, and passwords. This type of cyberattack is usually triggered by emails, instant messages, or phone calls. The existing anti-phishing techniques are mainly based on source code features, which require to scrape the content of web pages, and on third-party services which retard the classification process of phishing URLs. Although the machine learning techniques have lately been used to detect phishing, they require essential manual feature engineering and are not an expert at detecting emerging phishing offenses. Due to the recent rapid development of deep learning techniques, many deep learning-based methods have also been introduced to enhance the classification performance. In this paper, a fast deep learning-based solution model, which uses character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) for phishing detection based on the URL of the website, is proposed. The proposed model does not require the retrieval of target website content or the use of any third-party services. It captures information and sequential patterns of URL strings without requiring a prior knowledge about phishing, and then uses the sequential pattern features for fast classification of the actual URL. For evaluations, comparisons are provided between different traditional machine learning models and deep learning models using various feature sets such as hand-crafted, character embedding, character level TF-IDF, and character level count vectors features. According to the experiments, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 95.02% on our dataset and an accuracy of 98.58%, 95.46%, and 95.22% on benchmark datasets which outperform the existing phishing URL models.
Internet of Things security targets around secure network enabled devices that interface with one another on wireless network. IoT security is the secure component attached to the Internet of Things, and it endeavors to ensure IoT devices and systems against cybercrime. The Internet of Things is a developing pattern, with a cascade of new components hitting the market. As this grows widely there occurs an issue: When you're associated with everything, there are many approaches to hack your private data. That can make you an appealing objective for individuals who need to make a benefit off of your own information. Each associated devices you possess can include another protection concern, particularly since the majority of the interface with your cell phone. Any innovation accessible today has not come to its 100 % capacity. It generally has a hole to go. Thus, we can say that Internet of Things has a huge innovation in a world that can assist different advances with reaching its exact and finish 100 % ability also. This is widely called network intrusion which means an intruder steals one's private data over the network. IoT energizes the correspondence between devices, also popularly known as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. Along with this, the physical devices can remain associated. Due to association of physical devices, there occurs network traffic which leads to denial of services and bottleneck. To overcome these consequences in wireless sensor network, data routing protocols are implemented. This proposed system emphasizes how data traffic over wireless network are regulated by data routing protocol using genetic algorithm with the traffic information collected through IoT devices.
This empirical study is an exploration of the influence methods, fear appeals, and urgency cues applied by phishers to trick or coerce users to follow instructions presented in coronavirus-themed phishing emails. To that end, a content analysis of 208 coronavirus-themed phishing emails has been conducted. We identified nine types of phishing messages crafted by phishers. Phishing emails purporting to provide information about the spread of the disease were the most common type of unsolicited emails. Authority, liking and commitment emerged as the most common influence methods. Fear appeals and urgency cues were present in almost all of the sampled phishing messages. Finally, the analysis of coronavirus-themed phishing emails revealed a shift in the modus operandi of phishers. The implications of these results are discussed in this paper.
Smishing (SMS phishing) is a cybercrime in which criminals send fraudulent messages, including malicious links, to steal the victims' private data or cause financial losses. The damage caused by smishing has become more severe, particularly with the proliferation of mobile devices. In smishing, a major difficulty faced by victims is discrimination between normal and smishing messages. To resolve this problem, we present an on-device smishing classifier based on a deep-learning model. In real-world scenarios, access to a substantial, authentic dataset is crucial. We trained and evaluated the classifier using real SMS datasets containing approximately 250,000 smishing messages and 950,000 normal messages obtained from victims in Korea. To ensure privacy, the classifier operates solely on mobile devices without externally transmitting any data. It utilizes a lightweight method that does not require significant computing power on mobile devices. We explored several models to determine a suitable model for mobile devices and optimized it using real datasets. Furthermore, our statistical analysis of actual smishing messages revealed that 98% of smishing messages are variants of previously sent messages. To address the prevalence of variant smishing messages, we propose a text evasion attack tool called EVA that is capable of generating pseudo-variant messages from a given message using an adversarial attack approach. We used this tool to evaluate and enhance the robustness of our classifier against various messages. Our classifier exhibited exceptional classification accuracy (0.99) while being lightweight (at 127 kB) and robust against variant smishing messages (attack success rate of 0.41).
"Cybercrimes have increased against Android devices due to the increased usage of Instant Messaging, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Webcam Applications that are built into the Android device, resulting in invasion of the victim's privacy. The existing studies demonstrate how to utilize the vulnerabilities of the Android device; however, none have proposed a comprehensive study highlighting the hacking tricks and their countermeasures. This study demonstrates how to discover and fully control the Android device using existing tools. Furthermore, it proposes a novel GPS Tracking Application. The purpose of this research is twofold: 1. To demonstrate how to disclose the victim's sensitive information after performing diverse hacking tricks; and 2. To implement countermeasures for each Android hacking tricks. The author believe that such a scenario is needed for implementing awareness among Android device users. Also, it shows Android and Instant Messaging Application developers to mitigate existing vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing security levels."
The purpose of this study is to explore the need for digital forensic investigations at universities in South Africa and to determine if a university is forensically ready to conduct effective digital forensic investigations. For this research paper, the University of Cape Town is used as a case study. The research explores the existing digital forensic investigation process at the university and determines its capability to conduct a comprehensive digital forensic investigation. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were applied to this study using questionnaires, interviews and secondary data (documentation). Existing research within the field of digital forensics tends to focus on for-profit organisations, while educational institutions, such as the case study in this paper, have been largely ignored. Educational institutions have a strong emphasis on teaching, learning, research and support, thus the drive to increase digital forensic capability is less than at for-profit organisations. However, it is becoming increasingly important for all organisations to develop digital forensic capability due to the ever increasing rate of cybercrime. The key findings in this research established that the University of Cape Town had no demand for digital forensic investigations on campus and therefore had no formal digital forensic investigation process in place. The university had a minimal capacity to conduct these investigations and had no policy to manage digital forensic investigations. It was also found that digital forensic readiness should be developed at the university to ensure the capability to conduct digital forensic investigations. Further, some of the existing processes at the university could be adapted to develop a digital forensic readiness capability.
Digital forensics is now essential in addressing cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime but potentially it can have a role in almost every other type of crime. Given technology's continuous development and prevalence, the widespread adoption of technologies among society and the subsequent digital footprints that exist, the analysis of these technologies can help support investigations. The abundance of interconnected technologies and telecommunication platforms has significantly changed the nature of digital evidence. Subsequently, the nature and characteristics of digital forensic cases involve an enormous volume of data heterogeneity, scattered across multiple evidence sources, technologies, applications, and services. It is indisputable that the outspread and connections between existing technologies have raised the need to integrate, harmonise, unify and correlate evidence across data sources in an automated fashion. Unfortunately, the current state of the art in digital forensics leads to siloed approaches focussed upon specific technologies or support of a particular part of digital investigation. Due to this shortcoming, the digital investigator examines each data source independently, trawls through interconnected data across various sources, and often has to conduct data correlation manually, thus restricting the digital investigator's ability to answer high-level questions in a timely manner with a low cognitive load. Therefore, this research paper investigates the limitations of the current state of the art in the digital forensics discipline and categorises common investigation crimes with the necessary corresponding digital analyses to define the characteristics of the next-generation approach. Based on these observations, it discusses the future capabilities of the next-generation unified forensics analysis tool (U-FAT), with a workflow example that illustrates data unification, correlation and visualisation processes within the proposed method.
Phishing is one of the simplest ways in cybercrime to hack the reliable data of users such as passwords, account identifiers, bank details, etc. In general, these kinds of cyberattacks are made at users through phone calls, emails, or instant messages. The anti-phishing techniques, currently under use, are mainly based on source code features that need to scrape the webpage content. In third party services, these techniques check the classification procedure of phishing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Even though Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been lately utilized in the identification of phishing, they still need to undergo feature engineering since the techniques are not well-versed in identifying phishing offenses. The tremendous growth and evolution of Deep Learning (DL) techniques paved the way for increasing the accuracy of classification process. In this background, the current research article presents a Hunger Search Optimization with Hybrid Deep Learning enabled Phishing Detection and Classification (HSOHDL-PDC) model. The presented HSOHDL-PDC model focuses on effective recognition and classification of phishing based on website URLs. In addition, SOHDL-PDC model uses character-level embedding instead of word-level embedding since the URLs generally utilize words with no importance. Moreover, a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (HCNN-LSTM) technique is also applied for identification and classification of phishing. The hyperparameters involved in HCNN-LSTM model are optimized with the help of HSO algorithm which in turn produced improved outcomes. The performance of the proposed HSOHDL-PDC model was validated using different datasets and the outcomes confirmed the supremacy of the proposed model over other recent approaches.
Reducing physical distances within cyberspace allowed information to travel almost instantly while the international cybercrime phenomenon has risen almost inevitably. Most of the slips in cybersecurity come into being due to a poor management of the online environment, due to a lack of knowledge within the technological features in current use and due to the improper way to work with data. This issue leads to the necessity of outlining a cybersecurity culture along with respecting the rights related to online privacy. There is not yet a universally valid solution to the complex problem of cybersecurity, the field being very dynamic, the technological progress - very fast, while the individual cannot find enough self protection against organizations specialized in fraud, fake news dissemination, data retrieval, storage and destruction. The attitude towards cybersecurity does not represent a special case, it only completes and supports individual's attitude towards society. We must yet mention that these alarming scenarios are backed up by the business environment which looks at selling security solutions in growing numbers. Malware protection programs represent one of the most important measures to ensure cybersecurity measures. The dynamics of the internet and the frequency of attacks impose the use of efficient methods that identify suspicious behaviour. The situations in which signature detection fails, machine learning use can lead to acceptable results. This type of computational learning (supervised learning) implies using a set of data that make the ins and outs to be known, while the resulting model determines the connections and makes predictions over a new set of data. The present paper showcases the research done so far within The Integrated Software Platform for the mobile malware analysis.
Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity are ` hot topics' these days. Every organisation should have a proper response and recovery plan in place -whether it operates in public or private sector, and whether it is small or large. In particular since recent adverse events such as the Japan Tsunamis, potential Pandemic Flu outbreaks, increased risk of Cybercrime and IT system failures. And many organisations do have plans, in order to be able to confidently respond to crisis situations that impact on the availability of their building, their staff, their IT systems, their voice communications or perhaps one of their critical external suppliers. However, making a plan is not enough. and teaching people the content of the plan and their role in the event of a disaster doesn't provide the desired results if only done by means of written instructions, traditional presentations/hand-outs and e-learning methods. A more practical approach is required for staff and other stakeholders to feel emotionally, physically and psychologically prepared for a disaster or major incident. Disaster drills and simulations are a hands-on way to let participants experience their role and ` be in it' for a period of time, before a real disaster strikes. It has proven to be the only lasting method that instils clear-headedness, courage and creativity, which will be invaluable in a real-life incident. This presentation will show you some of the key ingredients to successful disaster simulations, including the use of Audio Visual tools, social media and role plays. The presenter will share her global experiences from Australia, Africa, Asia and Europe gained during her role as Business Continuity trainer and facilitator.
Soft set theory is the most developed tool for demonstrating uncertain, vague, not clearly defined objects in a parametric manner. Bipolar uncertainty incorporates a significant role in apprehending discrete and applied mathematical modeling and decision analysis of various physical systems. Graphical and algebraic structures can be studied more precisely when bipolar parametric linguistic properties are to be dealt with, emphasizing the need of a bipolar mathematical approach with soft set theory. In this research paper, we apply the powerful technique of bipolar fuzzy soft sets to hypergraphs and present a novel framework of bipolar fuzzy soft hypergraphs. We elaborate various methods for the construction of bipolar fuzzy soft hypergraphs. We discuss the concept of linearity in bipolar fuzzy soft hypergraphs and study isomorphism properties of bipolar fuzzy soft line graphs of bipolar fuzzy soft hypergraphs, dual and 2-section of bipolar fuzzy soft hypergraphs. We present an application of bipolar fuzzy soft information for analyzing chat conversations of pedophiles and detecting online child grooming cases.
Currently, within the world, cybercrime is becoming increasingly rampant-often targeting civil infrastructure like power stations and other critical systems. A trend that is being noticed with these attacks is their increased use of embedded devices in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This creates a substantial risk to systems and infrastructures worldwide. Threats to embedded devices can be significant, and network stability and reliability can suffer, mainly through the risk of battery draining or complete system hang. This paper investigates such consequences through simulations of excessive loads, by staging attacks on embedded devices. Experimentation within Contiki OS focused on loads placed on physical and virtualised wireless sensor network (WSN) embedded devices by launching DoS attacks and by exploiting the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Results from these experiments were based on the metric of power draw, mainly the percentage increase over baseline and the pattern of it. The physical study relied on the output of the inline power analyser and the virtual study relied on the output of a Cooja plugin called PowerTracker. This involved experiments on both physical and virtual devices, and analysis of the power draws characteristics of WSN devices with a focus on embedded Linux platforms and Contiki OS. Experimental results provide evidence that peak power draining occurs with a malicious-node-to-sensor device ratio of 13-to-1. Results show a decline in power usage with a more expansive 16-sensor network after modelling and simulating a growing sensor network within the Cooja simulator.
Fin-Tech is the merging of finance and technology, to be considered a key term for technology-based financial operations and money transactions as far as Fin-Tech is concerned. In the massive field of business, mobile money transaction security is a great challenge for researchers. The user authentication schemes restrict the ability to enforce the authentication before the account can access and operate. Although authentication factors provide greater security than a simple static password, financial transactions have potential drawbacks because cybercrime expands the opportunities for fraudsters. The most common enterprise challenge is mobile-based user authentication during transactions, which addresses the security issues against fraudsters. The confirmation of a user legitimation before the money transaction is highlighted by mechanisms and technologies from previous studies that may be helpful in user authentication. This study aims to identify the technologies for user authentication and the opportunity for their transformation to mobile money transaction security despite having all the legally required data for a transaction. This proposed review has identified the role of multifactor authentication techniques for authentication to mitigate the risk of fraudulent transactions-the analysis through 92 articles taken from famous publishers. The most relevant articles address authentication problems, of which 54 percent describe money transaction security, and the rest highlight the supporting technology for user authentication. The study platform described the technology-based approaches with the appreciation of new ideas for secure money transactions. The QR code and multifactor authentication are key terms that increased security by 46%. In addition, this also ensures the user is legitimate using advanced technologies and algorithms to predict and discover transaction risks and discourage fraudsters from trying.
Outlier (also known as anomaly) detection technology is widely applied to many areas, such as diagnosing diseases, evaluating credit, and investigating cybercrime. Recently, several studies, based on frequent itemset mining (FIM), have been proposed to detect outliers in categorical data. For efficiency, these FIM-based studies pruned (ignored) the majority of data by either imposing a threshold or restricting the length of the pattern or both, and they further adopted the limited information to evaluate observations. In spite of high efficiency, such a pruning approach encounters the problem of distortion, i.e., the accuracy decreases to a low level of discernment or even causes the contrary judgment in certain cases. In this paper, we introduce the concept relative patterns discovery from a new perspective on association analysis. To efficiently explore the relative patterns, we devise a hash-index-based intersecting approach (called the HA). Based on the knowledge of relative patterns, we propose an unsupervised approach (called the UA) to evaluate which observations are anomalous. Instead of using the limited information, our method can differentiate the features of observations without the problem of distortion. The results of the empirical investigation, conducted with eight real-world datasets on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, demonstrate that our method generally outperforms the previous studies not only in accuracy but also inefficiency. We also demonstrate that the execution complexity of our method is significantly efficient, especially in high-dimensional data. Furthermore, our method can represent a natural panorama of data, which is appropriate in controlled experiments for discovering more decisive factors in outlier detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Developing a long-lasting, secure Industry 4.0 system presents a significant challenge for businesses and other interested parties. Industrial control systems (ICSs) are particularly vulnerable to cybercrime because of the operating systems' excessive availability and high robustness requirements. This research investigates five graph-theory-based measures to evaluate the robustness of industrial network topologies against three centrality-based attacks and one random attack. Experiments are conducted to examine the three levels of the ICS network topology, from the field devices to the controllers and the enterprise devices. The results are twofold. On the one hand, the closeness-based attack is the most harmful since it has the highest destructive potential and needs to attack only half of the total nodes in the network to reach the lowest robustness level. The betweenness-based attack follows closely in terms of destruction, whereas the degree-based attack is less destructive but rapidly degrades the robustness of the network. On the other hand, the flow robustness measure provides the best performance in the presence of any of the studied attacks, showing strong perception of robustness reduction when only one percent of the total nodes in the network are attacked. For this reason, the flow robustness measure is suitable to identify and locate the targeted attacks at their early stages, preventing them from becoming more catastrophic. Finally, the results suggest that the industrial network security system should combine at least two measures to ensure robustness against the most destructive attacks and their early-stage detection. The research also confirmed the results by implementing attacks and measures on a real gas transmission network.
Most of the sophisticated attacks in the modern age of cybercrime are based, among other things, on specialized phishing campaigns. A challenge in identifying phishing campaigns is defining a classification of patterns that can be generalized and used in different areas and campaigns of a different nature. Although efforts have been made to establish a general labeling scheme in their classification, there is still limited data labeled in such a format. The usual approaches are based on feature engineering to correctly identify phishing campaigns, exporting lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, e.g., previous phrases. In this context, the most recent approaches have taken advantage of modern neural network architectures to record hidden information at the phrase and text levels, e.g., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, these models lose semantic information related to the specific problem, resulting in a variation in their performance, depending on the different data sets and the corresponding standards used for labeling. In this paper, we propose to extend word embeddings with word vectors that indicate the semantic similarity of each word with each phishing campaigns template tag. These embedded keywords are calculated based on semantic subfields corresponding to each phishing campaign tag, constructed based on the automatic extraction of keywords representing these tags. Combining general word integrations with vectors is calculated based on word similarity using a set of sequential Kalman filters, which can then power any neural architecture such as LSTM or CNN to predict each phishing campaign. Our experiments use a data indicator to evaluate our approach and achieve remarkable results that reinforce the state-of-the-art.
"Internet users are continually exposed to phishing as cybercrime in the 21st century. The objective of phishing is to obtain sensitive information by deceiving a target and using the information for financial gain. The information may include a login detail, password, date of birth, credit card number, bank account number, and family-related information. To acquire these details, users will be directed to fill out the information on false websites based on information from emails, adverts, text messages, or website pop-ups. Examining the website's URL address is one method for avoiding this type of deception. Identifying the features of a phishing website URL takes specialized knowledge and investigation. Machine learning is one method that uses existing data to teach machines to distinguish between legal and phishing website URLs. In this work, we proposed a method that combines correlation and recursive feature elimination to determine which URL characteristics are useful for identifying phishing websites by gradually decreasing the number of features while maintaining accuracy value. In this paper, we use two datasets that contain 48 and 87 features. The first scenario combines power predictive score correlation and recursive feature elimination; the second scenario is the maximal information coefficient correlation and recursive feature elimination. The third scenario combines spearman correlation and recursive feature elimination. All three scenarios from the combined findings of the proposed methodologies achieve a high level of accuracy even with the smallest feature subset. For dataset 1, the accuracy value for the 10 features result is 97.06%, and for dataset 2 the accuracy value is 95.88% for 10 features."
The increasing levels of criminal media being shared in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks pose a significant challenge to law enforcement agencies. One of the main priorities for P2P investigators is to identify cases where a user is actively engaged in the production of child sexual abuse (CSA) media - they can be indicators of recent or on-going child abuse. Although a number of P2P monitoring tools exist to detect paedophile activity in such networks, they typically rely on hash value databases of known CSA media. As a result, these tools are not able to adequately triage the thousands of results they retrieve, nor can they identify new child abuse media that are being released on to a network. In this paper, we present a new intelligent forensics approach that incorporates the advantages of artificial intelligence and machine learning theory to automatically flag new/previously unseen CSA media to investigators. Additionally, the research was extensively discussed with law enforcement cybercrime specialists from different European countries and Interpol. The approach has been implemented into the iCOP toolkit, a software package that is designed to perform live forensic analysis on a P2P network environment. In addition, the system offers secondary features, such as showing on-line sharers of known CSA files and the ability to see other files shared by the same GUID or other IP addresses used by the same P2P client. Finally, our evaluation on real CSA case data shows high degrees of accuracy, while hands-on trials with law enforcement officers demonstrate the toolkit's complementarity to extant investigative workflows.

Detection of network attacks is a challenging task, especially concerning detection coverage and timeliness. The defenders need to be able to detect advanced types of attacks and minimize the time gap between the attack detection and its mitigation. To meet these requirements, we present a stream-based IP flow data processing application for real-time attack detection using similarity search techniques. Our approach extends capabilities of traditional detection systems and allows to detect not only anomalies and attacks that match exactly to predefined patterns but also their variations. The approach is demonstrated on detection of SSH authentication attacks. We describe a process of patterns definition and illustrate their usage in a real-world deployment. We show that our approach provides sufficient performance of IP flow data processing for real-time detection while maintaining versatility and ability to detect network attacks that have not been recognized by traditional approaches.
"Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which cyber-attackers pose themselves as authorized persons or entities and hack the victims' sensitive data. E-mails, instant messages and phone calls are some of the common modes used in cyberattacks. Though the security models are continuously upgraded to prevent cyberattacks, hackers find innovative ways to target the victims. In this background, there is a drastic increase observed in the number of phishing emails sent to potential targets. This scenario necessitates the importance of designing an effective classification model. Though numerous conventional models are available in the literature for proficient classification of phishing emails, the Machine Learning (ML) techniques and the Deep Learning (DL) models have been employed in the literature. The current study presents an Intelligent Cuckoo Search (CS) Optimization Algorithm with a Deep Learning-based Phishing Email Detection and Classification (ICSOA-DLPEC) model. The aim of the proposed ICSOA-DLPEC model is to effectually distinguish the emails as either legitimate or phishing ones. At the initial stage, the pre-processing is performed through three stages such as email cleaning, tokenization and stop-word elimination. Then, the N-gram approach is; moreover, the CS algorithm is applied to extract the useful feature vectors. Moreover, the CS algorithm is employed with the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to detect and classify phishing emails. Furthermore, the CS algorithm is used to fine-tune the parameters involved in theGRUmodel. The performance of the proposed ICSOA-DLPEC model was experimentally validated using a benchmark dataset, and the results were assessed under several dimensions. Extensive comparative studies were conducted, and the results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed ICSOA-DLPEC model over other existing approaches. The proposed model achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.72%."
The increasing number of cyber-attacks has become a global problem for companies, public institutions, even for governments and for each particular user. Cybercrime causes damage of about 750 billion EUR every year in Europe alone. Thus, ICT security is nowadays a major concern, increasing the demand for specialists in this domain. Currently, universities do not produce enough graduates with strong network security skills able to defend against complex cyber-attacks. Recently new EU approved ERASMUS+ project (DECAMP) addresses innovatively this educational aspect. DECAMP brings together within a framework of an international partnership 6 EU universities and 3 associated partners. The project is set up to create 6 online courses with integrated heterogeneous virtual hands-on lab environments covering ICT Security issues of various application areas. Each partner creates a course corresponding to its expertise. These courses can be accessed by all the students, professors and researchers of the universities within the DECAMP consortium as well as from other EU universities. The core of the DECAMP project is an online distributed virtual campus. The paper describes the procedure developed for controlling a secure access of various types of users to the platform of eLearning course materials. The solution complies on one hand with all the differences of enrollment procedures installed at each particular EU University to verify the type of user (student, teacher, researcher, etc.) requiring access to the institution's resources. On the other hand the developed mechanism allows the users to obtain a single sign on (SSO) account which supports their accesses to all distributed modules of the platform, placed at the corresponding universities which create and maintain them. A prototype system that has been deployed for testing the proposed solutions is also presented.
"Tourism is one of the most dynamically developing areas of the world economy, in which rural areas are getting more and more importance, since they are popular target areas of tourists. It is an exciting task to examine the link between civil lifestyle, tourism and security. The three major new types of challenges - economic recession, cybercrime and terrorism, which threaten tourism and the industries involved - affect many fields of science. All kinds of safety begin with the individual and family security. This is followed by social security, then followed by the protection of national security and the security of the world and humanity. It is scientifically proven that safety is one of the basic human needs; there is the need for protection. In our paper we review and analyze some of the pivotal problems associated with tourism safety. This paper is only the first part of our broad research, in which we will also study the experiences of the civil population and tourists in Hungary and their sense of security. Research questions will be: 1. The European migration crisis reduced the sense of security both in population and in tourists. 2. Increased security preparedness will give a greater sense of security for both the civilian population and tourists. 3. The emergence of European migration crisis affected the Hungarians differently than the foreigners in their free movement in regards of their decisions for tourism purposes. The aim of our research is to see how much safety issues influence the general living and specific tourism potentials of the countryside, whether these issues have such negative impacts that halt the sustainable and smart development of rural settlements. In this paper we intended to call the attention on the relationship between rural development and security."
We live in an era of unprecedented technology. Millions of users depend on information technology to carry out their daily lives and large-scale commercial and industrial operations are no exception. At the same time, the rapidly growing interconnectivity of IT systems and the surge in cybercrime since the pandemic have rendered industry-standard hardware and software components increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks. Cyber defense is a coordinated act of resistance that intends to understand the capabilities and motives of attackers in order to secure our country's data and more importantly, the livelihoods of our citizens. This research aims to contribute to the progress of cybersecurity and defense technology as a whole by focusing on a dynamic aspect of malware: digital unwanted advertisements. It presents a novel approach to automating the analysis of malicious content on the internet by web scraping ads of the popular search engine Google to extract relevant data (URL, Company, Title, Product Desc.), building machine learning models (supervised & unsupervised) to classify and make predictions on that data, and creating a web application for end users to access. The results show that our tool can detect trends within the features with limited false positives, paving the way for us to make predictions on whether the advertisements are desirable or unwanted. The research concludes that in this time and age, it is extremely important to protect against fraud, especially by adhering to cybersecurity's best practices and to think about threats in more global terms. Our hope with this research is to prompt action to ensure society continues to improve in IT resilience.
The internet has had a major impact on how information is shared within supply chains, and in commerce in general. This has resulted in the establishment of information systems such as e-supply chains amongst others which integrate the internet and other information and communications technology (ICT) with traditional business processes for the swift transmission of information between trading partners. Many organisations have reaped the benefits of adopting the eSC model, but have also faced the challenges with which it comes. One such major challenge is information security. Digital forensic readiness is a relatively new exciting field which can prepare and prevent incidents from occurring within an eSC environment if implemented strategically. With the current state of cybercrime, tool developers are challenged with the task of developing cutting edge digital forensic readiness tools that can keep up with the current technological advancements, such as (eSCs), in the business world. Therefore, the problem addressed in this paper is that there are no DFR tools that are designed to support eSCs specifically. There are some general-purpose monitoring tools that have forensic readiness functionality, but currently there are no tools specifically designed to serve the eSC environment. Therefore, this paper discusses the limitations of current digital forensic readiness tools for the eSC environment and an architectural design for next-generation eSC DFR systems is proposed, along with the system requirements that such systems must satisfy. It is the view of the authors that the conclusions drawn from this paper can spearhead the development of cutting-edge next-generation digital forensic readiness tools, and bring attention to some of the shortcomings of current tools.
Stylometry is a method for identifying anonymous authors of anonymous texts by analyzing their writing style. While stylometric methods have produced impressive results in previous experiments, we wanted to explore their performance on a challenging dataset of particular interest to the security research community. Analysis of underground forums can provide key information about who controls a given bot network or sells a service, and the size and scope of the cybercrime underworld. Previous analyses have been accomplished primarily through analysis of limited structured metadata and painstaking manual analysis. However, the key challenge is to automate this process, since this labor intensive manual approach clearly does not scale. We consider two scenarios. The first involves text written by an unknown cybercriminal and a set of potential suspects. This is standard, supervised stylometry problem made more difficult by multilingual forums that mix 133t-speak conversations with data dumps. In the second scenario, you want to feed a forum into an analysis engine and have it output possible doppelgangers, or users with multiple accounts. While other researchers have explored this problem, we propose a method that produces good results on actual separate accounts, as opposed to data sets created by artificially splitting authors into multiple identities. For scenario 1, we achieve 77% to 84% accuracy on private messages. For scenario 2, we achieve 94% recall with 90% precision on blogs and 85.18% precision with 82.14% recall for underground forum users. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a case study that includes applying our technique to the Carders forum and manual analysis to validate the results, enabling the discovery of previously undetected doppelganger accounts.
Vice President for Promoting our European Way of Life Margaritis Schinas, stated at the time of the adoption of Europol's amendment that Europol is a true example of where EU action helps protect us all. Today's agreement will give Europol the right tools and safeguard to support police forces in analysing big data to investigate crime and in developing pioneering methods to tackle cybercrime. While some characterized the changes as an achievement for the adaptability and operational role of Europol, others argued that it undermines fundamental rights and weakens data protection. This paper analyses the amendments made to the Regulation and explores Europol's increasing role of in national investigations and the associated dangers of it. The paper starts with a historical analysis of Europol's legal framework and role in national criminal investigations, before diving into the core of the Regulation. After 2022, Europol supports Member States' investigations in many ways. First, through the continuous retention of large and complex datasets, which was strongly criticized by NGOs and the EDPS. Second, through the transformation of Europol into the information hub and broker for the exchanges of data with private parties. Third, more indirectly, through Europol's support of research and innovation projects, for national authorities to use and explore new technologies in their work. However, these amendments are not without dangers. The Regulation of 2022 pushes the boundaries of Europol's competences further, by circumventing existing limits and questioning the legality of the operations. The stronger role of Europol lacks sufficient safeguards and efficient oversight. This is highly problematic considering the impact Europol may have on national investigations, and as a result on the situation of individuals.
"Along with advances in information technology, cybercrime techniques also increased. There are several forms of attacks on data and information, such as hackers, crackers, Trojans, etc. The Symantec Intelligence report edition on August 2012 indicated that the attacker selected the target of attacks. The type of data is valuable and confidential. The Hackers selected the target to attack or steal interest information the first and they did not just taking random from a large amount of data. This indication worried because hackers stealing the data more planned. Therefore, today many systems reinforced with various efforts to maintain data security and overcome these attacks. Necessary methods to secure electronic messages that do not fall on those who are not authorized. One alternative is steganography. Cryptography and Steganography are the two major techniques for secret communication. Cryptography converts information from its original form (plaintext) into unreadable form (cipher text); where as in steganography is the art of hiding messages within other data without changing the data to it attaches, so data before and after the process of hiding almost look like the same. There are many different techniques are available for cryptography and steganography. The cryptography suspicion against disguised message is easily recognizable, because of the message disguised by changing the original message becomes as if illegible. While further reduce suspicion steganography disguised as a message hidden in the file. The research designed the application of steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) in which the previous message is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm (AES) and it can restore the previously hidden data. The messages in this form application and hidden text on media digital image so as not to arouse suspicion. The result of research shown the steganography is expected to hide the secret message, so the message is not easy to know other people who are not eligible."
The digital revolution we are witnessing nowadays goes hand in hand with a revolution in cybercrime. This irrefutable fact has been a major reason for making digital forensic (DF) a pressing and timely topic to investigate. Thanks to the file system which is a rich source of digital evidence that may prove or deny a digital crime. Yet, although there are many tools that can be used to extract potentially conclusive evidence from the file system, there is still a need to develop effective techniques for evaluating the extracted evidence and link it directly to a digital crime. Machine learning can be posed as a possible solution looming in the horizon. This article proposes an Enhanced Multiclass Support Vector Machine (EMSVM) model that aims to improve the classification performance. The EMSVM suggests a new technique in selecting the most effective set of parameters when building a SVM model. In addition, since the DF is considered a multiclass classification problem duo to the fact that a file system might be accecced by more than one application, the EMSVM enhances the class assignment mechanism by supporting multi-class classification. The article then investigates the applicability of the proposed model in analysing incriminating digital evidence by inspecting the historical activities of file systems to realize if a malicious program manipulated them. The results obtained from the proposed model were promising when compared to several machine-learning algorithms. (c) 2019 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

"Issues related to information culture evoke a natural interest of Ukrainian and foreign researchers. In addition to purely technical aspects and the development of competency characteristics, the problem of the development of students' information culture and their personal characteristics is acquiring particular relevance. Virtual space has significant advantages in terms of the speed of information distribution, communication opportunities, and the exchange of scientific data. At the same time, threats are evident, in particular the growth of cybercrime, aggression, dependence, and manipulation. This is particularly obvious in the youth environment. The creation of national elite in modern universities, the openness of the information space, globalization, and the growth of competition in the labor market require operational information for specification of educational policy and adoption of optimal managerial decisions. It becomes increasingly clear that there is a contradiction between the low level of information and analytical skills of students and the high level of requirements for the organization of work with computer technology; sufficient level of theoretical and practical knowledge and low level of skills necessary for work with information technologies; sufficient level of professional training and low level of readiness to use computer technologies in educational activities. Information culture is considered as one of the facets of the universal culture associated with the social nature of man and is the product of its various creative abilities. The need for original specialized courses, which allow quick response to new challenges and improve the quality of professional training of students is constantly increasing. The article outlines the preconditions for improving students' information culture in view of the experience of foreign countries and Ukraine."
"The cyberspace depicts an increasing number of difficulties related to security, especially in healthcare. This is evident from how vulnerable critical infrastructures are to cyberattacks and are unprotected against cybercrime. Users, ideally, should maintain a good level of cyber hygiene, via regular software updates and the development of unique passwords, as an effective way to become resilient to cyberattacks. Cyber security breaches are a top priority, and most users are aware that their behaviours may put them at risk; however, they are not educated to follow best practices, such as protecting their passwords. Mass cyber education may serve as a means to offset poor cyber security behaviours; however, mandatory education becomes a questionable point if the content is not focused on human factors, using human-centric approaches and taking into account end users' behaviours, which is currently the case. The nature of the present paper is largely exploratory, and the purpose is two-fold: To present and explore the cyber hygiene definition, context and habits of end users in order to strengthen our understanding of users. Our paper reports the best practices that should be used by healthcare organisations and healthcare professionals to maintain good cyber hygiene and how these can be applied via a healthcare use case scenario to increase awareness related to data privacy and cybersecurity. This is an issue of great importance and urgency considering the rapid increase of cyberattacks in healthcare organisations, mainly due to human errors. Further to that, based on human-centric approaches, our long-term vision and future work involves facilitating the development of efficient practices and education associated with cybersecurity hygiene via a flexible, adaptable and practical framework."
Over the past few years, the number of crimes related to the worldwide diffusion of digital devices with large storage and broadband network connections has increased dramatically. In order to better address the problem, law enforcement specialists have developed new ideas and methods for retrieving evidence more effectively. In accordance with this trend, our research aims to add new pieces of information to the automated analysis of evidence according to Machine Learning-based post mortem triage. The scope consists of some copyright infringement court cases coming from the Italian Cybercrime Police Unit database. We draw our inspiration from this low level crime which is normally sat at the bottom of the forensic analyst's queue, behind higher priority cases and dealt with the lowest priority. The present work aims to bring order back in the analyst's queue by providing a method to rank each queued item, e. g. a seized device, before being analyzed in detail. The paper draws the guidelines for drive-under-triage classification (e. g. hard disk drive, thumb drive, solid state drive etc.), according to a list of crime-dependent features such as installed software, file statistics and browser history. The model, inspired by the theory of Data Mining and Machine Learning, is able to classify each exhibit by predicting the problem dependent variable (i.e. the class) according to the aforementioned crime-dependent features. In our research context the class variable identifies with the likelihood that a drive image may contain evidence concerning the crime and, thus, the associated item must receive an high (or low) ranking in the list.
This paper investigates the generation of personal biometric data, encryption of data, and the storage of such data in a cloud based database. The data generator simulates the movement and action of an active person for detailed analysis in other projects. Included is a report on the performance of the data generator implementing different data encryption algorithms and storage in NoSQL document databases. Additionally this paper contains results of experiments from tests on the writing performance of the NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Couchbase, Elasticsearch and RethinkDB) using the emulated data.
"Currently, the world of digital forensics analysis is dividing into multiple branches, with each branch needing its own specific set of skills and competences. A growing number of best practices for analysing the different media are reported in many publications, such as the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence website [1]. The forensics analysis of a video, for example, shares nothing in common (except scientific procedure) with the examination of a mobile content extraction. This ongoing fragmentation of the digital forensics specialisations impacts on the ability to acquire a comprehensive global overview of the entire investigation. The range of data is vast, and thus, selecting the right insight is vital, for example, using a known procedure or tested tool to conduct the investigation, as described in the Computer Forensic Tool Testing Program (CFTT NIST) documentation [2]. CDR (Call Detail Record) analysis is a great source of information, but is sometimes overlooked; the volume of the data seems overwhelming and the lack of a standard model could be discouraging. Combining this massive amount of useful data with other data sources, such as GPS positions, BTS log files, mobile extractions, highway and traffic logs, will provide the investigator with a complete picture of the events. CDR analysis can be the keystone of the digital forensics world, pulling all the elements together to effectively counteract anti-forensics."
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse research surrounding mandate fraud and to devise a crime script identifying the crime commission process. It is hoped this will assist in standardising investigation of mandate fraud by law enforcement. Design/methodology/approach The design of this paper follows on from the approach taken by van Hardeveld et al. (2017) in identifying a cybercrime script for carding activity. The current environment surrounding the investigation of digital fraud in the UK is examined through a review of the existing literature. Analysis of the crime commission process for mandate fraud is then outlined in a potential crime script identifying possible intervention points for law enforcement. Findings UK law enforcement's current response to digital fraud is struggling to provide positive outcomes for victims. There is inconsistency in the investigative approach and practical issues surrounding how the digital fraud problem is tackled. Changing the emphasis of digital fraud investigation to focus on the money laundering networks based in the UK also needs to be considered. Standardising investigation into digital fraud by mapping out digital criminality using crime scripts and routine activity theory could be beneficial for law enforcement. The results of this process could also assist in effectively identifying where law enforcement resources may be best deployed to solve some of the practical issues highlighted. Originality/value There is little literature directly focused on a crime script for mandate fraud. This is despite it being a significant contributor to fraud losses in the UK. For law enforcement, both digital and financial investigation skill sets are required to investigate such offences. Therefore, mapping the crime commission process has significant value for clearly identifying investigative intervention points.
This study examines whether macro-level opportunity indicators affect cyber-theft victimization. Based on the arguments from criminal opportunity theory, exposure to risk is measured by state-level patterns of internet access (where users access the internet). Other structural characteristics of states were measured to determine if variation in social structure impacted cyber-victimization across states. The current study found that structural conditions such as unemployment and non-urban population are associated with where users access the internet. Also, this study found that the proportion of users who access the internet only at home was positively associated with state-level counts of cyber-theft victimization. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.
The prevalence of cybercrime has emerged as a critical issue in contemporary society because of its far-reaching financial, social, and psychological implications. The negative effects of cyber-attacks extend beyond financial losses and disrupt people's lives on social and psychological levels. Conventional practice involves cyber experts sourcing data from various outlets and applying personal discernment and rational inference to manually formulate cyber intelligence specific to a country. This traditional approach introduces personal bias towards the country-level cyber reports. However, this paper reports a novel approach where country-level cyber intelligence is automatically generated with artificial intelligence (AI), employing cyber-related social media posts and open-source cyber-attack statistics. Our innovative cyber threat intelligence solution examined 37,386 tweets from 30,706 users in 54 languages using sentiment analysis, translation, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), N-gram, and Porter stemming. Moreover, the presented study utilized 238,220 open-intelligence cyber-attack statistics from eight different web links, to create a historical cyber-attack dataset. Subsequently, AI-based algorithms, like convolutional neural network (CNN), and exponential smoothing were used for AI-driven insights. With the confluence of the voluminous Twitter-derived data and the array of open-intelligence cyber-attack statistics, orchestrated by the AI-driven algorithms, the presented approach generated seven-dimensional cyber intelligence for Australia and China in complete automation. Finally, the topic analysis on the cyber-related social media messages revealed seven main themes for both Australia and China. This methodology possesses the inherent capability to effortlessly engender cyber intelligence for any country, employing an autonomous modality within the realm of pervasive computational platforms.
"One of the important factors for popularity and addiction of Facebook is due to the daily installments and use of third party apps. The new way of cybercrime is introduced by hackers in online social networks (OSNs). Hackers identified various ideas to damage the computer systems and methods to forward spam messages for advertisement purpose in illegal way. As popularity of third-party apps platform and deploying malicious applications increases so hackers have started taking advantages. Online social media is considered as a rich source of information as it provides the good quality content; however consumption of poor quality content can degrade user experience, and have unsuitable impact in the real world. In this paper we proposed system which develop tool that can predict malicious application with better results as compare to existing system. Proposed system implements the classification technique. This technique is used for identifying malicious app. System added parameters like number of user rating and user review to generate better results. That is user rating and Description Content check-up. Every app has few reviews as a feedback from user side, and we consider user mention all related to that app which is as per its experience. We consider all that reviews for checking app is malicious or benign. Existing system says that malicious app doesn't give any description but what about such malicious app which gives description and such benign app which doesn't give description...?? Its completely opposite of accuracy result. So in this paper we consider these two points as new feature of FRAppE for improving result accuracy. By including these parameters the proposed framework produces better result prediction."
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) use sophisticated cyberattacks to disrupt a nation's critical infrastructure. Conventional cyberattack management is response-driven, which (while important) is ineffective, especially in managing APTs. There is an immediate need for anticipatory defense measures that reflect the adaptive nature of this new breed of adversaries. This paper identifies five main research areas that need immediate attention. Using a criminological framework and empirical evidence of observations and interviews done at Industrial Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team's (ICS-CERT) Red/Blue cybersecurity training exercise held at Idaho National Laboratory, this paper argues that understanding how adversaries adapt at various points in the intrusion chain is crucial in profiling APTs and developing anticipatory cybersecurity measures. The paper offers recommendations for further research and the relevance of multidisciplinary collaboration.
Five decades ago advances in integrated circuits and time-sharing operating systems made interactive use of computers economically feasible. Visions of man-computer symbiosis and the augmentation of man's intellect became realistic research objectives. The initial focus was on facilitating interactivity through improved interface technology, and supporting its application through good practices based on experience and psychological principles. Within a decade technology advances made low cost personal computers commonly available in the home, office and industry, and these were rapidly enhanced with software that made them attractive in a wide range of applications from games to office automation and industrial process control. Within three decades the Internet enabled human-computer interaction to extend across local, national and international networks, and, within four, smartphones and tablets had made access to computers and networks almost ubiquitous to any person, at any time and any place. Banking, commerce, institutional and company operations, utility and government infrastructures, took advantage of, and became dependent on, interactive computer and networking capabilities to such an extent that they have now been assimilated in our society and are taken for granted. This hyperconnectivity has been a major economic driver in the current millennium, but it has also raised new problems as malevolent users anywhere in the world have become able to access and interfere with critical personal, commercial and national resources. A major issue for human-computer studies now is to maintain and enhance functionality, usability and likeability for legitimate users whilst protecting them from malevolent users. Understanding the issues involved requires a far broader consideration of socio-economic issues than was required five decades ago. This article reviews various models of the role of technology in human civilization that can provide insights into our current problematique.
Underground hacking has evolved from its early countercultural roots to become a complex and varied phenomenon. By combining a historical review of the literature with a content analysis of 30 years of underground hacker communication, we show that hacking has evolved in three waves to embrace learning and creativity, intrusion and crime, as well as politics and cyberwarfare. We uncover a paradoxical relationship between hackers and society at large where underground hacking is considered a digital crime while at the same time inspiring and driving corporate innovation, cybersecurity, and even cyberwarfare. The outcome of our research provides a nuanced picture of the hacker underground by highlighting differences between competing discursive themes across time. Moreover, by translating these themes into a set of six contrasting personas of IS professionals, we discuss how knowledge, technologies, and creative practices of underground hackers are being professionalized. We use this discussion to provide implications and a research agenda for IS studies in cybersecurity, innovation, and cyberwarfare.
Similarity searching has become widely utilized in many online services processing unstructured and complex data, e.g., Google Images. Metric spaces are often applied to model and organize such data by their mutual similarity. As top-k queries provide only a local view on data, a data analyst must pose multiple requests to observe the entire dataset. Thus, group-by operators for metric data have been proposed. These operators identify groups by respecting a given similarity constraint and produce a set of objects per group. The analyst can then tediously browse these sets directly, but representative members may provide better insight. In this paper, we focus on concise representations of metric datasets. We propose a novel concept of a metric hull which encompasses a given set by selecting a few objects. Testing an object to be part of the set is then made much faster. We verify this concept on synthetic Euclidean data and real-life image and text datasets and show its effectiveness and scalability. The metric hulls provide much faster and more compact representations when compared with commonly used ball representations. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
"Like notions of process equivalence, behavioural preorders on processes come in many flavours, ranging from fine-grained comparisons such as ready simulation to coarse-grained ones such as trace inclusion. Often, such behavioural preorders are characterized in terms of theory inclusion in dedicated characteristic logics; e.g. simulation is characterized by theory inclusion in the positive fragment of Hennessy-Milner logic. We introduce a unified semantic framework for behavioural preorders and their characteristic logics in which we parametrize the system type as a functor on the category Pos of partially ordered sets following the paradigm of universal coalgebra, while behavioural preorders are captured as graded monads on Pos, in generalization of a previous approach to notions of process equivalence. We show that graded monads on Pos are induced by a form of graded inequational theories that we introduce here. Moreover, we provide a general notion of modal logic compatible with a given graded behavioural preorder, along with a criterion for expressiveness, in the indicated sense of characterization of the behavioural preorder by theory inclusion. We illustrate our main result on various behavioural preorders on labelled transition systems and probabilistic transition systems."
World is moving rapidly towards the digital transformation. The internet across the world is growing rapidly which gives rise to many opportunities in every field including entertainment, finance, education, sports etc. As every coin has two aspects, the internet also has many advantages and disadvantages. We know about the advantages, but the only major disadvantage that everyone should be aware of is the increase in cyber-attacks. It is nothing, but the illegal activity committed on the internet. Many government websites and systems were hacked in the past few years and it has caused a huge loss to the nations like India, USA and China. These governments have already taken various steps to counter these crimes & attacks. But still, the attackers are coming up with new ways of attacking every time. There is need for some concrete solution which is not in the reach of the attackers. For developing such systems and tools we have done a deep analysis of various types of cybercrime and attacks happened in past along with existing solutions proposed by many researchers. Therefore, this paper presents a study on various cyber-attacks that were triggered in India and other countries in the past few years. The various prevention methods proposed in past to deal with these kinds of attacks. These prevention methods are based on machine learning algorithms like a random forest, k-means clustering, support vector machine and artificial neural network applied in order to prevent cyber-attacks. Also, in this paper, we have reported proposed intelligent system which is based supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to avoid these cyber-attacks. This proposed system might provide high efficiency with a minimum human intervention which can be implemented and used as a universal solution to most of the common cyber-attacks.
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a protective technology designed to increase the security of online accounts. The enhanced security is achieved by using two layers of authentication to facilitate a login process so that should one layer become compromised (e.g. a password), the second layer will still ensure that the account is protected. Considering the prevalence of cybercrime and in particular, password attacks, it is important to examine the behaviour of individuals in terms of the effort they make to protect their online account(s). Studies surrounding 2FA have focused on the various technologies supporting it as well as issues concerning its usability and convenience. In general, users fail to protect themselves online due to the effort that is required. Enhanced security means increased effort and inconvenience, and although risks are present and perceived by Internet users, sufficient effort to protect their online accounts is not made. This study made use of a Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) approach in trying to understand the behaviour of Internet users surrounding their intentions to adopt 2FA to protect their online account(s). The PMT model is adapted to include an additional concept focusing on 'Technology Awareness'. Empirical data was collected using an online survey, with 209 responses analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). Results were in line with other protective technology literature in terms of the perception of online threat vulnerability and severity being less significant in determining behavioural intention than the perception of the technology itself. The results show that the perception of (1) the difficulty associated with using the 2FA technology (response costs) and (2) the effectiveness of the 2FA technology (response efficacy) prove to be significant in determining behavioural intention to adopt 2FA as protective technology. Lastly, awareness of online security issues and solutions was relevant in the adapted PMT model and significantly influenced intention.
Voice recognition technology is very important for prevention of identity crimes and cybercrimes because voice contains a lot of personal information. In this research, we propose a voice recognition system which consists of two stages of the feature extraction and identification. In feature extraction, noise directly affects the reason of feature extraction. Therefore, how to effectively remove noise is a special important study voice recognition system. Voice signal will be unavoidably affected by the interference of noise in the process of generation and transmission, thus resulting in a decline in the recognition rate of the system. When someone now enroll and use themselves voiceprint with noise to verify their identity by our presented system, the next time only use an app to access online services or phone, this security recognition system will help online system protect users account and reduce the chances of scammers accessing users account and information. The results of experiments, when SNR are -5, 0 and 5, the recognition rate of our proposed system can reach 80.1%, 86.2% and 90.4%, respectively. This research fits to the key approaches to prevent cybercrimes.
Under most circumstances, cyber criminals will commit fraudulent transactions using proxy services which hide their real IP address and physical location. This is done in an effort to avoid being tracked and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies. This paper presents the investigation of a proxy detection methodology and efforts to implement such technology into a business solution with the sole purpose of eliminating the majority of fraudulent transaction attempts. The approach, described in this paper identifies multiple proxy connectivity methods, and implements a multi-tiered detection technique. The result of the experiments demonstrates that the proxy methodology improves business security by identifying users who are utilizing proxies and to collect data that prevents potentially fraudulent activities.
The EU Commission has proposed a new Directive on combating sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The updated piece of legislation proposes to block access to child pornography websites. After months of negotiation, the Council, Parliament and Commission have agreed on a compromised text which generates more confusion and has been lambasted as meaningless. The compromised text is a result of powerful lobbying by Hollywood porno industry, Internet Service Providers and civil libertarians. The compromised text brings to highlight the tension between freedom of speech and protection of children. (C) 2011 Sylvia Kierkegaard. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Of all the types of cybercrime considered in this book, piracy, illegal file sharing and/or other types of copyright infringement are probably the offences that members of the general public are most likely to have committed. Yar (2007) indicates that piracy activity seems to be very widespread, including individuals from various social classes, although there seems to be a disproportionate number of young people engaging in the activity. This chapter aims to determine if those involved in piracy and online copyright infringement activities see themselves as criminals. It also aims to examine how such offenders justify their actions and how they can be dissuaded from such acts. Definitions of key terms in the area will be presented, along with some examples of real events relating to illegal file sharing. A description of some of the methods used during illegal file sharing and piracy will be provided, along with a historical view of how copyright infringement has developed over time. The known current prevalence rates and costs of offending will be considered, along with arguments presented from industry and academia regarding the effects of file sharing on legitimate sales. Similarly, the problem of trying to estimate the true cost of piracy and illegal file sharing will be highlighted. The psychology of offenders will be considered, and in particular, the phenomenon of the lack of insight of offenders into their own criminality will be investigated. In particular, the roles of self-control, social learning and justifications in illegal file sharing will be analysed. Some potential solutions for these crimes will be considered, including the determination of appropriate punishments and the development of suitable educational campaigns. Finally, potential future trends and research will be described.
The threat of Cyberterrorism is a sub-category of the overall threat environment that can emerge from cyberspace. In consequence military commanders have to take this into account for planning and executing operations when the strategic threat assessment indicates the presence of this specific threat to the operation. The article provides a practitioner's perspective along the military Operational Planning Process (OPP) and the recent developments to integrate cyber considerations in this process along the questions what ... if ... a commander of an (EU-led) Crisis Management Operation (CMO) has to respond inter alia to the (so far fictional) tasking, ... in cooperation with all relevant partners and stakeholders take appropriate means and actions to counter Cyberterrorism in the Area of Responsibility (AoR).... It provides considerations, which are the relevant planning aspects and factors that the commander should take into account in order to respond to the tasking. This includes the characteristics of cyberspace, the phenomenon of cyberterrorism as such, the type of the military operation, the mandate, the legal framework, the (cyber) situation in the theatre, the necessary information and capabilities, necessary processes/procedures, as well as the relationship with other Cyber Security Providers like Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in the AoR. It provides an assessment of the use of military capabilities in countering cyberterrorism in crisis management operations, and draws conclusions on the different options and limitations for a complementary use of LEAs and the Military in countering cyberterrorism as it occurs in current and future CMO outside of EU boundaries.
Cities all over the world are becoming increasingly smarter, including Dubai Smart City. The Smart Cities vision is to automate critical public services, make improvements for community interaction, and achieve significant levels of efficiency in a connected and technology-driven society, such as in traffic control. However, this has positioned Smart Cities to be a target of compromised Cyber Security, which can potentially undermine the information systems of local departments, general security, law enforcement, and transport systems. Dubai is a dynamic and emerging economy that has the potential to become a major economic center of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region owing to its strength in strategic information. The main purpose of this paper is to explore, evaluate, and discuss components of overall strategic security, innovation, management, and the development of Dubai in terms of Cyber Security. This study also showcases conducted survey results based on the Smart City Cyber Security program. Furthermore, it demonstrates the current and future challenges faced by Smart Cities from cyber-threats, including the development of strategic security plans to defend against sophisticated cyberattacks, and encourages citizens to take responsibility and implement awareness of how to proactively counter cyberattacks on Smart Cities. However, it is imperative to evaluate the strategies that are required to prepare Dubai's Electronic Security Center to align with Dubai Vision 2021 in order for Dubai to be one of the securest Smart Cities in terms of Cyber Security around the globe. This research aims to argue that to develop Dubai's Electronic Security Center, strategies should be a top priority for Dubai to ensure the security of the Smart City and to diminish cybercrime in Dubai.
The internet has become so integrated with users' daily activities, that cyber users interweave their daily activities automatically between the physical and cyberspace without noticing. Cyberspace can be referred to as a virtual computer world, which includes the connectivity of multiple networks. These connections between multiple networks within cyberspace form a global computer network to enable online communication between cyber users. Cyber users connect to cyberspace for socialising, work and educational purposes. The advantages of cyberspace are enormous and to a great benefit to all cyber users and cyber business. However, cyberspace opens the door to a number of possible cyber risks and cybercrimes that can affect cyber users. Cybercrimes and risks relate to either financial loss, disruption or damage to the reputation of a cyber user or organisation. These cybercrimes can include hacking, phishing or identity theft. Cyber users may not be aware of or knowledgeable regarding cyber risks and cybercrimes. The cyber user needs to be cyber safety conscious in order to be protected against cyber risks and cybercrimes. In many instances, cyber users within the industrial sector are being made aware of cyber risks through education and training programmes within their working environment. However, many cyber users within communities in South Africa are not working in industry and therefore do not have access to opportunities regarding cyber safety awareness. This research aims to investigate the level of cyber safety awareness within communities and propose a number of approaches that can be used to create and implement cyber-safety awareness programmes and material within different communities. Differently communities within South Africa have different needs that can range from different languages, learning approaches and community-defined processes and procedures. A quantitative research method and random sampling were used to obtain data about cyber safety awareness within communities. In the research, a survey with full ethical clearance was used.
The data generated by Internet of Things devices is increasingly being introduced as evidence in court. The first US case involving the introduction of medical data from a pacemaker as evidence of arson and insurance fraud was State of Ohio v Compton. The purpose of this article is three-fold. First, the article explores this case, looking in particular at the facts of the case and the charges brought against the defendant. Second, the article critically examines the decision of the trial court judge during the suppression hearing for the evidence from the pacemaker. In this hearing, the judge ruled that the search and seizure did not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of the defendant and allowed the pacemaker data to be entered as evidence against him. Third, the article considers the implications of this decision for future cases involving Internet-of-Things (IoT) medical data. Ultimately, the constitutional protections of IoT medical device data and the circumstances under which the data from these devices will be collected and used as evidence, are issues that currently demand the attention of legal and digital forensics professionals and warrant public debate.
Internet has brought a lot of security challenges on the interaction, activities, and transactions that occur online. These include pervasion of privacy of individuals, organizations, and other online actors. Relationships in real life get affected by online mischievous actors with intent to misrepresent or ruin the characters of innocent people, leading to damaged relationships. Proliferation of cybercrime has threatened the value and benefits of internet. Identity theft by fraudsters with intent to steal assets in real space or online has escalated. This study has developed a metrics model based on distance metrics in order to quantify the credential identity attributes used in online services and activities. This is to help address the digital identity challenges, bring confidence to online activities and ownership of assets. The application forms and identity tokens used in the various sectors to identify online users were used as the sources of the identity attributes in this paper. The corpus toolkits were used to mine and extract the identity attributes from the various forms of identity tokens. Term weighting schemes were used to compute the term weight of the identity attributes. Other methods used included Shannon Entropy and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency scheme (TF*IDF). Standardization of data using data normalization method has been applied. The results show that using the Cosine Similarity Measure, we can identify the identity attributes in any given identity token used to identify individuals and entities. This will help to attach the legitimate ownership to the digital identity attributes. The developed model can be used to uniquely identify an online identity claimant and help address the security challenge in identity management systems. The proposed model can also identify the key identity attributes that could be used to identify an entity in real or cyber spaces.
In today's digital age, the digital transformation is necessary for almost every competitive enterprise in terms of having access to the best resources and ensuring customer satisfaction. However, due to such rewards, these enterprises are facing key concerns around the risk of next-generation data security or cybercrime which is continually increasing issue due to the digital transformation four essential pillars- cloud computing, big data analytics, social and mobile computing. Data transformation-driven enterprises should ready to handle this next-generation data security problem, in particular, the compromised user credential (CUC). When an intruder or cybercriminal develops trust relationships as a legitimate account holder and then gain privileged access to the system for misuse. Many state-of-the-art risk mitigation tools are being developed, such as encrypted and secure password policy, authentication, and authorization mechanism. However, the CUC has become more complex and increasingly critical to the digital transformation process of the enterprise's database by a cybercriminal, we propose a novel technique that effectively detects CUC at the enterprise-level. The proposed technique is learning from the user's behavior and builds a knowledge base system (KBS) which observe changes in the user's operational behavior. For that reason, a series of experiments were carried out on the dataset that collected from a sensitive database. All empirical results are validated through well-known evaluation measures, such as (i) accuracy, (ii) sensitivity, (iii) specificity, (iv) prudence accuracy, (v) precision, (vi) f-measure, and (vii) error rate. The experiments show that the proposed approach obtained weighted accuracy up to 99% and overall error of about 1%. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently can detect CUC which may keep an organization safe from major damage in data through cyber-attacks.

Purpose The aims of this paper are to explore the rise of cyberhate on the Zoom video conferencing platform at the outset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine victimized cases of Zoombombing where it was used as a cyberhate tool. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only impacted our lives and modes of working and studying, but also created new environments for cybercriminals to engage in cybercrime, cyberhate and hacking by exploiting tools such as Zoom. This new phenomenon called Zoombombing was first reported in mid-March 2020, when the social distancing and stay-at-home policies in the United States were nationally introduced. Design/methodology/approach This research conducted a news media content analysis on cases of Zoombombing. To conduct this analysis empirically, a dataset with all of the reported Zoombombing cases from March to April 2020 was created. Google Trends, news media and tweets were used to analyze Zoombombing as a form of cyberhate, particularly digital racism. Findings The results reveal prevalent Zoom-mediated racism toward Asian Americans, African Americans and Jewish Americans. This study understands Zoombombing from a sociopolitical/cultural perspective through news reporting of victimized cases and explores various ways that Zoombombing shapes, mediates, transforms and escalates racism. Originality/value This study is one of the very first studies to analyze Zoombombing in a way that builds upon an emerging body of literature on cyberhate. This paper considers Zoom as a space where curious young people, cybercriminals, extremists and hackers impose their ideologies and beliefs upon newly established online learning and working environments and engage in a struggle for identity recognition in the midst of increasingly accessible vulnerable software and cyberspace.
"Cloud computing has drastically altered the ways in which it is possible to deliver information technologies (ITs) to consumers as a service. In addition, the concept has given rise to multiple benefits for consumers and organizations. However, such a fast surge in the adoption of cloud computing has led to the emergence of the cloud as a new cybercrime environment, thus giving rise to fresh legal, technical and organizational challenges. In addition to the vast number of attacks that have had an impact on cloud computing and the fact that cloud-based data processing is carried out in a decentralized manner, many other concerns have been noted. Among these concerns are how to conduct a thorough digital investigation in cloud environments and how to be prepared to gather data ahead of time before the occurrence of an incident; indeed, this kind of preparation would reduce the amount of money, time and effort that is expended. As a number of cloud forensics challenges have not received enough attention, this study is motivated by a particular gap in research on the technical, legal and organizational factors that facilitate forensic readiness in organizations that utilize an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model. This paper presents a framework with which to investigate the factors that facilitate the forensic readiness of organizations. This framework was identified by critically reviewing previous studies in the literature and by performing an in-depth examination of the relevant industrial standards. The factors were comprehensively studied and extracted from the literature; then, the factors were analysed, duplicates were removed, and the factors were categorized and synthesized to produce the framework. To obtain reliable results, the research method involved two steps: a literature review, followed by expert reviews. These techniques help us paint a comprehensive picture of the research topic and validate and confirm the results."
This paper discusses a new online tool for online gamers to share networking performance results and to produce aggregate networking performance reports generated from the data reported by all users. It is necessary to improve the quality of service and make online games faster. This will help improve latency sensitive game data collection. It will help to improve gaming performance through the global network of servers, optimizing the game connection from end to end. A Web API was developed to receive data in the form of a HTTP post from WTFast clients while they are playing their games. A data generator was also built to simulate thousands of concurrent users posting data to the web API. The web API stores the data in a Elasticsearch database. A web interface was built for WTFast clients to view their historical network data and to share it on forums or social media. The web interface shows a graph of their network performance with and without using the GPN (R). The complete system is anticipated to need to handle approximately 400,000 concurrent users sending network data every 2 seconds.
The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is one of the main issues faced by cloud service providers due to their intricate nature. The main aim of this attack is to disrupt the services of authorized users by forwarding massive malicious requests to the victim system. Even though the modern Artificial Intelligence-powered intrusion detection system offers improved benefits, it suffers from analyzing the traces of intrusion in the massive network flow. This article presents a novel Chaos-based Henry Gas Solubility Optimization-Weight initialization based-rectified linear Unit (HGSO-WIB-ReLU) framework to identify different types of DoS attacks like HTTP flood attacks, DNS flood attacks, and ICMP flood attacks. The main aim of this technique is to identify the low rate of DoS attacks which the state-of-art techniques often based on statistical analysis and machine learning are incapable of accomplishing. Convolutional neural network architecture incorporates the WIB-ReLU activation function primarily to prevent vanishing gradient issues and provide efficient training. The WIB-ReLU framework's hyperparameters are primarily improved using the HGSO method by increasing the classifier's accuracy rate for detecting DoS attacks. In this way, the proposed model minimized the high false positive rate in identifying low-rate DoS attacks in large datasets. Different benchmark datasets such as BUET- DDoS2020, CIC DoS Attacks, and Low Rate DDoS are used to conduct the experiments and the efficiency of the model is verified in terms of accuracy, F1-measure, and precision score. When evaluated using the BUET-DDoS, CIC-DoS, and Low rate DDoS datasets, the proposed model offers an accuracy of 97%, 96.67%, and 96%, respectively. The experimental analysis conducted demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HGSO-WIB-ReLU framework when compared to the different state-of-art methodologies.
We review seminal social science theories of Trust & Control to consider how their application to Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (DLT, e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple) provide the potential for fresh criminal and information security challenges to traditional mechanisms of criminal detection and law enforcement. The social science theories of trust and control provide an accessible matrix to evaluate malicious behavior related to these new forms of money and currency. This foreshadows the ability for DLTs to become the 'poison of choice' for crime and security objectives or perhaps be avoided altogether by criminals. We argue that an understanding of DLTs is incomplete without a social science underpinning and framework which trust and control provide. The continued use of these technologies will require public and private institutions to rethink their approaches to crime prevention and information security for purely digital threats.
Network forensics can be an expansion associated with network security design which typically emphasizes avoidance and detection of community assaults. It covers the necessity for dedicated investigative abilities. When you look at the design, this indeed currently allows investigating harmful behavior in communities. It will help organizations to examine external and community this is undoubtedly around. It is also important for police force investigations. Network forensic techniques can be used to identify the source of the intrusion and the intruder's location. Forensics can resolve many cybercrime cases using the methods of network forensics. These methods can extract intruder's information, the nature of the intrusion, and how it can be prevented in the future. These techniques can also be used to avoid attacks in near future. Modern network forensic techniques face several challenges that must be resolved to improve the forensic methods. Some of the key challenges include high storage speed, the requirement of ample storage space, data integrity, data privacy, access to IP address, and location of data extraction. The details concerning these challenges are provided with potential solutions to these challenges. In general, the network forensic tools and techniques cannot be improved without addressing these challenges of the forensic network. This paper proposed a thematic taxonomy of classifications of network forensic techniques based on extensive. The classification has been carried out based on the target datasets and implementation techniques while performing forensic investigations. For this purpose, qualitative methods have been used to develop thematic taxonomy. The distinct objectives of this study include accessibility to the network infrastructure and artifacts and collection of evidence against the intruder using network forensic techniques to communicate the information related to network attacks with minimum false-negative results. It will help organizations to investigate external and internal causes of network security attacks.
TLS is crucial to network security, but TLS-related APIs have been repeatedly shown to be misused. While existing usable security research focuses on cryptographic primitives, the specifics of TLS interfaces seem to be under-researched. We thus set out to investigate the usability of TLS-related APIs in multiple libraries with a focus on identifying the specifics of TLS. We conducted a three-fold exploratory study with altogether 60 graduate students comparing the APIs of three popular security libraries in establishing TLS connections: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and mbed TLS. We qualitatively analyzed submitted reports commenting on API usability and tested created source code. User satisfaction emerged as an interesting, potentially under-researched theme as all APIs received both positive and negative reviews. Abstraction level, error handling, entity naming, and documentation emerged as the most salient usability themes. Regarding functionality, checking for revoked certificates was especially complicated and other basic security checks seemed not easy as well. In summary, although there were conflicting opinions on both the interface and documentation of the libraries, several usability issues were shared among participants, forming a target for closer inspection and subsequent improvement.
Smartphones and tablets have become important in daily life as they provide a convenient and mobile means to seek, access and share information. This convenience carries a downside in the rising concern with mobile security. Conveying the importance of personal digital security is notoriously difficult with adult users and perhaps more so for users who are children. Children are avid consumers of novel apps, frequently install new programs, and regularly update existing ones. Since apps can have hidden actions or malicious behaviour, this places users at risk from malicious or modified apps and some teenage users avoid specific apps out of concern for privacy. For example, location information is considered sensitive, so thousands of mobile apps that access GPS data, might impact upon children's privacy and security. This paper reports a school-based survey of mobile usage as a perspective on issues in smartphone security. Our results suggest that males are more cautious than females in relation to installation of software applications on mobile devices and tend to be more aware of permission issues than their female counterparts. In contrast, a larger proportion of females than males received upsetting, attacking or bullying content from other people.
The development of the information and digital world determines the formation of new public requests, firstly, to ensure the security of cyberspace. The development of social tasks that can be solved using information technologies is constantly growing, therefore the number of cybercrimes is increasing, and their specifics are changing. An analysis of the development trend of cybersecurity and cybercrime showed that the number and scale of cyberattacks will continue to grow. Accordingly, the purpose of the article is to find the development directions of approaches to ensuring security in cyberspace in accordance with modern global challenges. The article determines that new global challenges have significantly changed the system of people's life conducting financial transactions, trade, receiving services (administrative, communal, social, and household, etc.), and providing communication systems. In the conditions of the pandemic, the processes of all spheres of human activity only spread. The analysis of digitalization models for ensuring cybersecurity is presented in the article but needs clarification and further development, which relates to new global challenges in the security architecture in the world and on the European continent. The article considers approaches to ensuring the effectiveness of cybersecurity in new social conditions. The article uses the methods of control charts to conduct a sociological survey to rank the factors of influence on the cause-and-effect relationships of cybersecurity. The put-forward hypothesis regarding the structuring of influencing factors allows us to systematize directions for further research. The projection of the trend line of the number of cyberattacks and the number of subjects subjected to cyberattacks in the analyzed period determines the scaling and complication of protection processes both at the company level and at the state level.
"Ransomware is a type of malicious software that locks out its victim from accessing functionality or data on their device, typically by encrypting files. To regain access, victims would typically need to make a ransom payment. Victims get notified that their device has been infected through a ransom note (splash screen) displayed on their device. Ransomware splash screens can be presented in many ways; the most common ones are via a text file or a graphical user interface (GUI). Splash screens may also include additional features, such as a countdown timer, as part of the ransomware operator's ploy to encourage their victims to pay. The main aim of this study was to gain valuable insights into how ransomware splash screens might affect victims' responses. Moreover, the study also investigated whether exposure to different splash screens would encourage participants to adopt good security behaviours. A controlled experiment was conducted by randomly assigning 538 participants into one of the three ransomware infection scenarios based on the splash screen type (Text -based, GUI or GUI + Timer). After watching a demonstration of a ransomware scenario, each participant was asked to complete a survey regarding their post-infection behaviour and their cybersecurity habits. The study concluded that ransomware's user interface elements do not have a notable effect on how victims would react, in terms of their willingness to pay or their reporting rates. Additionally, even though 60% of the participants would like to report a ransomware incident, they were not sure how to do this. This illustrates a lack of public awareness about cybercrime reporting. Lack of trust was the main reason why participants did not want to click on links offering cybersecurity advice after the exposure. This shows that more effective methods for encouraging cybersecurity behaviour are still needed."
"The people having a perpetrating mind and the facilitation in advanced technologies cause the criminogenic activities in cyberspace, thereby creating societal problems. Darknet is an internet-based technology that builds on an encrypted network. Darknet networks can be accessed using a specific software with a specific network configuration; its content does not index by any search engines. Since its beginning, Darknet has been used for criminogenic tasks and applauded primarily for cybercrime promotion, including arms and drug dealing. Few countries have control over digital media and are ruled by a suppressive government. They have formulated strict policies for freedom fighters and journalism, using the Darknet anonymously. Also, many people use it for illegal purposes. Therefore, we have both positive and negative impacts of the darknet on human society and just cannot be discarded. However, in this paper, our prime concern emanates from the darknet network detection from the network traffic data through the deep transfer learning model. To provide a more accurate result, we transform time-based features into a three-dimensional image and then feed it into a pretrained model for the extraction of promising features. In this study, we considered the Deepinsight method to transform the numerical features into image data. These features were then used in a proposed bi-level classification system to classify the input data into malicious activities. To identify the optimized pretrained network this paper utilized 10 pre-trained models: AlexNet, ResNetl8, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16, VGG19, Inceptionv3, and SqueezeNet with three different baseline classifiers, namely support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest. In addition to malicious activity prediction, the proposed model could also predict the type of traffic. The experiment results illustrate that the VGG19 based features along with random forest can classify the traffic data with 96% of accuracy. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
This paper describes our research on the insider threats of Social engineering. Social engineering is a method using interaction between humans to get the access of a system in an illegal way. Due to staff's lack of confidentiality, the confidentiality of records is compromised, data is stolen or financial damage is done. This is insider threat. Social engineering and insider threat are two of the most relevant subjects in cyber security today. This research summarizes and seeks solution for the drawback of Social engineering through analyzing the Insider Threat cases. The first stage is to introduce the importance of using social engineering to reduce internet crime by analyzing the past loss created by insider threats. The second test illustrates insider threats' hazards to network security are ongoing. The third part covers the situation of insider threats with the emphasis on the security side. The topic of security aspect is extended to the rest of internal control of system, data exchange, and management of employees and their communication content. Actually, by the time of this abstract, insider threats are still not being taken as seriously as it should be. Many companies and organizations have given little thought to the insider threat but have concentrated on keeping attackers outside the network. This research will directly focus on the insider threats of organizations and the ways hackers use social engineering with the latest analysis of technology involved and examples that are close to common cybercrime. We aim to reveal the importance of reducing insider threats in organizations. The further research will be focused on a group consisted of managers and engineers within a company and the communication means of staff to the outside world. The analysis of the related crime cases will help prevent similar tragedy and seek possible approaches.
Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular machine learning(ML), deep learning (DL) has seen huge pace in recent years and is now set to really start influencing all aspects of community and occupations in which people are engaged. This growth has been charged the advancement in computing power, combined with headway in algorithms and cybersecurity is no exception. AI is an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to look like they have natural brilliance. Systems which are based on AI, sometimes called as cognitive systems, are helping us automate many jobs and gear up difficulties which are more complex than most humans are capable of solving. New generations malware and cyber attacks can be difficult to detect with traditional cybersecurity procedures. They develop over time, so more vigorous approaches are necessary. Solutions for these problems in security rely on ML use data from earlier attacks to respond to newer. Another significant advantage of AI systems in cybersecurity is that they will free up a huge amount of time for IT employees. AI is most commonly used to detect threats and attacks. The systems are developed in a such a way that it must be able to act quickly to the situation on its own. And AI systems do not make errors in completing their tasks. So each threat is responded in the most effective and proper way. In future days, there will be a rapid increase of an international clash in cyberspace. This may include attacks on infrastructure and utilities, as well as damaging normal operations of government and financial bodies, traditional society institutions such as banks, press, law enforcement, and judicial. So taking the cybersecurity as an issue for this paper and let us see the challenges and what is the role of AI, ML, and DL in avoiding cybercrime in future.
Social ideas and affordable and global online communications. Many people use social networks to communicate and express their opinions in supporting or opposing different causes, with most of this user-generated content being textual information. As there are a lot of raw data of people posting real time messages about their opinions on a variety of topics in daily life, it is a worthwhile research endeavor to collect and analyze these data, which may be useful for government to make informed decisions or to monitor public opinion. Data available in social media is obviously only one type of information that can be of interest when trying to detect a possible terrorist or radical group, there are several cases for example in which the social media has been used by radical thinkers to act as influencers and encourage fanatics with the same radical views to take violent action.Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for opinion mining and extremist content detection in on line social media data. Social media data targeted in this work to analyze, is the public text post on Facebook, the most popular social networking site. With this framework, machines can learn how to automatically extract the set of messages from Facebook public pages, using API graph calls, filter out non opinion messages,determine their sentiment regarding the issue of interest directions (i.e. positive, negative) and detect violent or extremist content. The purpose of this model is to build a Big Data application that gets stream of public data from Facebook social network, which can help law enforcement and cybercrime analysts with analyzing and monitoring social media, in the search of digital trace of violence or radicalism, that can be exploited in further digital forensic investigation
The wide diffusion of mobile devices and the ability of users to customize their experience through applications (Apps) is opening to new problems related to privacy, security and data integrity for the mobile ecosystem. Smartphones, in general, and Android devices, in particular, are rapidly becoming emerging threat vectors of cybercrime activities. Unofficial Android markets, especially those with weak controls on published Apps, are the places where frauds may easily start and spread. Hence, the ability to identify and quickly shut down deceptive Apps is of paramount importance in the protection of users, services and infrastructures. Traditional approaches that aim at mitigating the presence of malicious Apps in unofficial markets, are based on crawlers for scanning stores and checking the words used in Apps' description. These methods works very well when the App's title, keywords and description match specific patterns that identify services to protect and the application owner or App's signature do not match expected ones. Unluckily, the performance of such methods reduce sharply when the store adopts a language that is not supported by the recognition system or the App publisher uses misleading words in the App's description. Nevertheless, App publishers always use a logo which is familiar to the user in order to highlight the application and increase the probability that the users install it. In this paper we presents a system that overcomes the limitation of traditional approaches including logo analysis in the process of App recognition. Our contribution is the definition and evaluation of a logo-based complementary system to be used in conjunction with traditional approaches based on word lists checking. The system and the performance of the proposed solution are presented and analyzed in the paper.
In this technological world one of the general method for user to save their data is cloud. Most of the cloud storage company provides some storage space as free to its users. Both individuals and corporate are storing their files in the cloud infrastructure so it becomes a problem for a forensics analyst to perform evidence acquisition and examination. One reason that makes evidence acquisition more difficult is user data always saved in remote computer on cloud. Various cloud companies available in the market serving storage as one of their services and everyone delivering different kinds of features and facilities in the storage technology. One area of difficulty is the acquisition of evidential data associated to a cybercrime stored in a different cloud company service. Due to lack of understanding about the location of evidence data regarding which place it is saved could also affect an analytical process and it take a long time to speak with all cloud service companies to find whether data is saved within their cloud. By analyzing two cloud service companies (IDrive and Mega cloud drive) this study elaborates the various steps involved in the activity of obtaining evidence on a user account through a browser and then via cloud software application on a Windows 7 machine. This paper will detail findings for both the Mega cloud drive and IDrive client software, to find the different evidence that IDrive and the mega cloud drive leaves behind on a user computer. By establishing the artifacts on a user machine will give an overall idea regarding kind of evidence residue in user computer for investigators. Key evidences discovered on this investigation comprises of RAM memory captures, registry files application logs, file time and date values and browser artifacts are acquired from these two cloud companies on a user windows machine.
There is an emerging international phenomenon of drugs that are sold without any control on online marketplaces. An example of a former online marketplace is Silk Road, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs operated as a Tor hidden service. Silk Road was closed by FBI in 2013 but new alternatives have appeared since illicit substances is a big market. One problem with online marketplaces is that the sold substances have many different names and new substances are constantly developed. In this work we use semantic techniques to automatically detect new names of drugs. Our experiments are applied on data from a darknet marketplace, on which we use a set of known drug names and distributional statistics to find words that are semantically similar. The results show that semantic technologies work very well when it comes to detecting names of drugs on darknets.
Recently, well-known and established South African organisations have experienced cyberattacks. South African Bank Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) confirmed in October 2019 that the industry had been hit by a wave of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting multiple banks. This happened shortly after the website of City of Johannesburg (CoJ) succumb to a ransomware attack. These attacks are a wakeup call for South African organisations and underline the essential need for suitable detection mechanisms to prevent cyberattacks. The detection of cyberattacks relies not only on understanding existing attacks but also being able to identify emerging threats. The continuous and strategic collection of relevant and valuable cybersecurity data sets can offer insight into ongoing threats or cyberattacks, while also assisting with the combatting of cybercrime. Although various third-party providers, such as Shodan and Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), exist and do provide access to cybersecurity data sets, these providers have little to no presence in South Africa (SA). Most of the available cybersecurity data sets are heavily slanted towards the United States and the identified trends might not be relevant to the South African context. Therefore, this paper introduces the Lost Packet warehousing Service, a technological solution that will function as the primary source for cybersecurity data collection within South Africa. The Lost Packet Warehousing Service will allow for the continuous but passive collection of cybersecurity data sets. Examples of such data sets could include network telescope, honeypot and NetFlow collectors. Data analysis and processing techniques are then applied to the collected cybersecurity data sets to identify, infer, detect and predict emerging trends and cyberattacks. Also discussed in this paper is the steps taken to maintain the security and privacy of the collected cybersecurity sets. The paper concludes by discussing the various benefits offered by the Lost Packet Warehousing Service.
Transformations of data objects into the Hamming space are often exploited to speed-up the similarity search in metric spaces. Techniques applicable in generic metric spaces require expensive learning, e.g., selection of pivoting objects. However, when searching in common Euclidean space, the best performance is usually achieved by transformations specifically designed for this space. We propose a novel transformation technique that provides a good trade-off between the applicability and the quality of the space approximation. It uses the n-Simplex projection to transform metric objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, and then transform this space to the Hamming space. We compare our approach theoretically and experimentally with several techniques of the metric embedding into the Hamming space. We focus on the applicability, learning cost, and the quality of search space approximation.
As recent events have clearly demonstrated, the first years of the 21st century have been tenser than experts in the field would have estimated some time ago. This situation is largely due to significant developments in the global security environment, generated by newer (cybercrime) or older (terrorism, trans-border crime) risks and threats, which have reached unpredictable levels of intensity. Changes in the security environment will inevitably lead to a reconsideration of identity security and of the responsibility for the patrimonial, cultural and religious values of a state. We believe that besides representing a political project, the effort of managing Europe is or should also be a project for managing the European cultural space. Valorizing the heritage of every nation, safeguarding the masterpieces that have not yet been recognized as such, the monuments, the traditions and the small heritage of all the countries belonging to this cultural area (regardless of the political evolution of united Europe) is becoming the primary mission in a Europe of cultures. Noting the impact of cultural and religious determinations on either individual or collective personality, social psychology is called upon to analyze and describe the ways in which individuals and societies can influence culture, behavior and spirituality, but also the ways in which culture and religion can influence, in their turn, individuals and societies. Day after day, it is becoming increasingly clear that 21st-century Europe is a space of-often inadvertent-interference between religion and culture, the former having contributed to the development of culture and having, indeed, created culture. Aware of its contribution to the creation of culture, religion remains open to dialogue with the culture of the secular society, not in order to impose its own views, but to build interconnecting bridges.
This article considers the legal response to romance frauds. This is an issue that attracts increasing scholarship, as digital communication technologies not only make it easier for people to meet but also for scammers to prey on unsuspecting victims. Initially, these scams would take place solely online, and they could proceed very rapidly. While these still exist, they increasingly take place over a prolonged period and can be very sophisticated, including the establishment of a real relationship. Historically, the law responds to this crime through offences relating to fraud, but this arguably leaves parts of the behaviour unpunished. Using hypothetical case studies (vignettes), this article compares how the law in England and Wales, Scotland and Canada tackles romance fraud. It concludes by suggesting the need for a new offence where sexual activity is procured by deception.
A parallel neural joint model algorithm is proposed for the analysis and detection of malicious Uniform Resource Locator (URL). By detecting and analyzing malicious URL's characteristics, the semantic and visual information will be extracted. First, a visualization algorithm is used to realize the visualization of the URL mapping to a gray image with texture characteristics. Second, the lexical feature and character feature of URL are extracted and further processed through word vector technology. These extracted features are transformed into lexical embedding vectors and character embedding vectors. To combine the texture features with text features, a parallel joint neural network combining capsule network (CapsNet) and independent recurrent neural network (IndRNN) is utilized to capture multi-modal vectors of visual and semantic information synchronously. The last layer utilizes the attention mechanism to further filter the deep features extracted from the overall network while concentrating on effective features improving the classification accuracy and analyzing and detect malicious URLs. Based on the experimental results, it is demonstrated that this algorithm has higher accuracy compared to the traditional algorithms.
"Concerns about cyberwar, cyberespionage, and cybercrime have burst into focus in recent years. The United States and China have traded accusations about cyber intrusions, and a December 2012 U.N. conference broke down over disagreements about cyberspace governance. These events show the increased risk of cyberconflict and the corresponding need for basic agreement between states about governing cyberspace. States agree that something must be done, but they disagree about almost everything else. Two competing visions of cyberspace have emerged so far: Russia and China advocate a sovereignty-based model of cyber governance that prioritizes state control, while the United States, United Kingdom, and their allies argue that cyberspace should not be governed by states alone. Prior academic writing has focused on cyber issues related to states' regulation of their citizens, but this Article addresses the now-pressing state-to-state issues. A limited analogy to existing legal regimes for the high seas, outer space, and Antarctica shows that global governance of cyberspace is possible. Moreover, these existing regimes provide a menu of options for governance and establish a baseline against which cyber governance can be assessed. The Article examines three fundamental questions that states have answered for the other domains and must now answer for cyber: (I) what role, if any, private parties should play in governance; (2) how the domain should be governed (no governance system, treaty, or norms); and (3) whether and how to regulate military activities in the domain. The answers for the old domains were similar multilateral governance, governance by treaty, and some level of demilitarization. But cyber differs from the old domains in important ways that suggest the answers for cyber should be different. This Article argues for multistakeholder governance, governance through norms, and regulated militarization."
The emerging dynamic architectures of autonomous digital ecosystems raise new challenges in the process of assuring trust and safety. In particular, the admission of software smart agents into autonomous dynamic ecosystems will become a significant future topic. In this work we propose the concept of predictive simulation, which elevates from the concept of virtual Hardware-in-the-Loop (vHiL) testbed, to support rapid runtime evaluation of software smart agents in autonomous digital ecosystems. Based on this testbed, we introduce a novel strategy for building trust in software components that enter an ecosystem as black boxes without executing their behavior which can be potentially malicious, but by executing corresponding digital twins which are abstract models fed with real-time data.
Robust cyber-resilience depends on sound technical controls and testing of those controls in combination with rigorous cyber-security policies and practices. Increasingly, corporations and other organizations are seeking to test all of these, using methods more sophisticated than mere network penetration testing or other technical audit operations. More sophisticated organizations are also conducting so-called Red Team exercises, in which the organization tasks a small team of highly skilled and trained individuals to try to gain unauthorized access to physical and logical company assets and information. While such operations can have real value, they must be planned and conducted with great care in order to avoid violating the law or creating undue risk and reputational harm to the organization. This article explores these sometimes tricky issues, and offers practical risk-based guidance for organizations contemplating these types of exercises. (C) 2018 Joseph V. DeMarco.

Smartphones have become increasingly popular, and, nowadays, thanks to the use of 3G networks, the need for connectivity in a business environment is significant. Smartphones provide access to a tremendous amount of sensitive information related to business, such as customer contacts, financial data and Intranet networks. If any of this information were to fall into the hands of hackers, it would be devastating for the company. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based approach to detecting abnormal behaviour in smartphone applications. First we carry out various robust clustering techniques that help to identify and regroup applications that exhibit similar behaviour. The clustering results are then used to define a cluster-based outlier factor for each application, which in turn identifies the top n malware applications. Initial results of the experiments prove the efficiency and accuracy of cluster-based approaches in detecting abnormal smartphone applications and those with a low false alert rate.
Effective criminal investigation depends on reliable access to evidence. With the extensive use of cloud computing in various forms, electronic evidence of criminal activity may no longer be found with criminals or their associates themselves. Rather, the evidence resides with cloud providers, oftentimes on servers outside of the territory of the investigating law enforcement authorities (LEAs). Thus, even in otherwise completely domestic criminal investigations of crime committed domestically against a domestic victim, relevant electronic evidence may be stored in a cloud arrangement in another country. Obtaining the evidence in those situations may be difficult. In this article, we identify 16 variables and a number of fundamental and non fundamental constraints that must be taken into account by anyone setting out to construct a framework facilitating appropriate LEA access to evidence via direct contact with cloud providers, while safeguarding the rights and interest of individuals, as well as the rights and interest of the provider, and those of other States.

Many methods in image forensics are sensitive to varying amounts of JPEG compression. To mitigate this issue, it is either possible to a) build detectors that better generalize to unknown JPEG settings, or to b) train multiple detectors, where each is specialized to a narrow range of JPEG qualities. While the first approach is currently an open challenge, the second approach may silently fail, even for only slight mismatches in training and testing distributions. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a forensic detector that is able to express uncertainty in its predictions. This allows detecting test samples for which the training distribution is not representative. More specifically, we propose Bayesian logistic regression as an instance of an infinite ensemble of classifiers. The ensemble agrees in its predictions from test samples similar to the training data but its predictions diverge for unknown test samples. The applicability of the proposed method is evaluated on the task of detecting JPEG double compression. The detector achieves high performance on two goals simultaneously: It accurately detects double-JPEG compression, and it accurately indicates when the test data is not covered by the training data. We assert that the proposed method can assist a forensic analyst in assessing detector reliability and in anticipating failure cases for specific inputs.
Modern industries widely rely upon software and IT services, in a context where cybercrime is rapidly spreading in more and more sectors. Unfortunately, despite greater general awareness of security risks and the availability of security tools that can help to cope with those risks, many organizations (especially medium/small-size ones) still lag when it comes to building security into their services. This is mainly due to the limited security skills of common developers/IT project managers and to the typically high costs of security procedures. In fact, while automated tools exist to perform code analysis, vulnerability scanning, or security testing, the manual intervention of security experts is still required not only for security analysis and design, but also to configure and elaborate the output of the security testing tools. In this paper, we propose a novel secure software development methodology aimed at supporting developers from security design to security testing, suitable for integration within modern DevOps pipelines according to a DevSecOps (or SecDevOps) approach. The proposed methodology leverages a model-based process that enables identifying existing threats, selecting appropriate countermeasures to enforce, and verify their mitigation effectiveness through both static assessment procedures and targeted security tests. To demonstrate our approach's feasibility and concretely illustrate the devised activities, we provide a step-by-step description of the whole process concerning a containerized microservice-based application case study. In addition, we discuss the application of the proposed methodology, in its threat modeling and security testing phases, to a well-known vulnerable web application widely used for security training purposes, to illustrate that we can identify most of the existing vulnerabilities and determine appropriate test plans to assess and mitigate such vulnerabilities.
Phishing leverages people's tendency to share personal information online. Phishing attacks often begin with an email and can be used for a variety of purposes. The cybercriminal will employ social engineering techniques to get the target to click on the link in the phishing email, which will take them to the infected website. These attacks become more complex as hackers personalize their fraud and provide convincing messages. Phishing with a malicious URL is an advanced kind of cybercrime. It might be challenging even for cautious users to spot phishing URLs. The researchers displayed different techniques to address this challenge. Machine learning models improve detection by using URLs, web page content and external features. This article presents the findings of an experimental study that attempted to enhance the performance of machine learning models to obtain improved accuracy for the two phishing datasets that are used the most commonly. Three distinct types of tuning factors are utilized, including data balancing, hyper-parameter optimization and feature selection. The experiment utilizes the eight most prevalent machine learning methods and two distinct datasets obtained from online sources, such as the UCI repository and the Mendeley repository. The result demonstrates that data balance improves accuracy marginally, whereas hyperparameter adjustment and feature selection improve accuracy significantly. The performance of machine learning algorithms is improved by combining all fine-tuned factors, outperforming existing research works. The result shows that tuning factors enhance the efficiency of machine learning algorithms. For Dataset-1, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (XGB) achieve accuracy rates of 97.44% and 97.47%, respectively. Gradient Boosting (GB) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) achieve accuracy values of 98.27% and 98.21%, respectively, for Dataset-2.
This paper examines two recent Canadian legislative initiatives intended in whole or in part to combat cyberbullying: the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia and the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act. Both pieces of legislation were responses to the suicide deaths of female teenagers Rehtaeh Parsons in Nova Scotia and Amanda Todd in British Columbia. It is questionable whether either suicide was directly caused by cyberbullying. Todd was primarily a victim of an adult capper living in the Netherlands, who persuaded her to expose her breasts via web cam, and then attempted to use the captured images to extort money and more images. Parsons was filmed engaging in what police concluded was consensual sex with several teenage boys at a house party. The cell phone video was posted on the Internet, making Parsons a victim of sexting. In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada fired a shot across the bow of Bill C-30, the immediate predecessor to the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, ruling that a police search (permissible under Bill C-30) in a child pornography case infringed upon constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and upon the right to privacy in cyberspace. In 2015, the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia was struck down by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia because it violated constitutional rights to freedom of expression and to life, liberty and security of person. In a criminal harassment case involving Twitter, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled in 2016 that Twitter is like a public square, where freedom of expression is protected, and where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. These three court decisions can be expected to limit the extent to which Canadian legislators and law enforcement agencies can go in their efforts to pursue and prosecute cyberbullies and/or cyber criminals.
Within a digital ecosystem, systems and actors form coalitions for achieving common and individual goals. In a constant motion of collaborative and competitive forces and faced with the risk of malicious attacks, ecosystem participants require strong guarantees of their collaborators' trustworthiness. Evidence of trustworthy behavior derived from runtime executions can provide these trust guarantees, given that clear definition and delimitation of trust concerns exist. Without them, a base for negotiating expectations, quantifying achievements and identifying strategical attacks cannot be established and attainment of strategic benefits relies solely on vulnerable collaborations. In this paper we examine the relationship between goals and trust and we introduce a formalism for goal representation. We delimit the trust concerns with anti-goals. The anti-goals set the boundaries within which we structure the trust analysis and build up evidence for motivated attacks.
A nation cannot sustain a highly productive and efficient population without smart cities. Due to their significant reliance on digital technologies, these cities require a high level of cybercrime protection. Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention due to their secure and reliable infrastructure. The decentralised cryptocurrency operates in a trust-less environment known as the blockchain, where each network participant has a ledger copy of all transactions. Blockchain technology employs a proven consensus mechanism without requiring establishment of a central authority. But the consensus mechanism requires miner to solve a cryptographic problem by generating random hashes until one of them matches the desired one. This procedure is energy-intensive, and when thousands of miners repeat it to verify a single transaction, a substantial amount of electricity is consumed. Moreover, electricity produces a significant amount of carbon footprint. Patch methodology utilises the data of all hashes created per year and the efficiency of mining hardware over a 10-year period to calculate the Bitcoins energy consumption. Due to a large number of unknown and uncertain factors involved, it is difficult to precisely calculate a single value for electricity consumption and carbon footprint as reported by Patch methodology. The proposed method extends the Patch methodology by adding a maximum and minimum limit to the hardware efficiency as well as the sources of power generation, which can help refine estimates of electricity consumption and carbon emissions for a more accurate picture. Using the proposed methodology, it was estimated that Bitcoin consumed between 38.495 and 120.72 terawatt hours of electricity in 2021 and released between 2.12 and 45.37 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. To address the issue of excessive energy consumption and carbon emissions, a significant number of individual miners and mining pools are relocating to energy-intensive regions, such as aluminium mining sites that rely on hydroelectricity for energy generation.
The article aims to highlight the usefulness of composite indicators applications as an analytical tool in guiding national security policies related to multidimensional phenomena revealing its role in measuring hybrid threats - as part of global risks.The qualitative and quantitative research shows that the use of composite indicators in measuring hybrid threats at country level is a relatively new topic, that has enjoyed increased interest since 2021.The originality lies in the way it is putted in evidence the link between the composite nature of hybrid threats, and the composite indicators in order the argue the role using this modern tool in the process of forecasting the risks with national impact, by using SWOT analysis.To highlight the relevance of composite indicators in measuring hybrid threats to peace and security, we have chosen to compare the results of measurement made by Normandia Index. The outcomes demonstrate upward trend in hybrid threat values (cybercrime, economic crises, disinformation, energy insecurity and terrorism) at the UE-27 level (as one country), comparative to the world level situation, between 2019-2022.We concluded that using composite indicators in measuring hybrid threats represents an analytical strategical level method that could play a role as an early warning engine to support policy makers and, also as a facilitator instrument of the planning process country level to avoid strategic surprises and prevent security risks.Considering the geopolitical clashes of power poles and the unpredictable situation of the socioeconomic environment, we have concluded that future steps of the research should be related with the dynamics of hybrid threats at the global level. An important contribution could be brought by the development of new systems for interpreting measurement by specialized software, and by the identification of appropriate calculation formulas to reduce misinterpretation due to the lack of real data provided.
Although the number of cloud projects has dramatically increased over the last few years, ensuring the availability and security of project data, services, and resources is still a crucial and challenging research issue. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are the second most prevalent cybercrime attacks after information theft. DDoS TCP flood attacks can exhaust the cloud's resources, consume most of its bandwidth, and damage an entire cloud project within a short period of time. The timely detection and prevention of such attacks in cloud projects are therefore vital, especially for eHealth clouds. In this paper, we present a new classifier system for detecting and preventing DDoS TCP flood attacks (CS_DDoS) in public clouds. The proposed CS_DDoS system offers a solution to securing stored records by classifying the incoming packets and making a decision based on the classification results. During the detection phase, the CS_DDOS identifies and determines whether a packet is normal or originates from an attacker. During the prevention phase, packets, which are classified as malicious, will be denied to access the cloud service and the source IP will be blacklisted. The performance of the CS_DDoS system is compared using the different classifiers of the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), naive Bayes, K-nearest, and multilayer perceptron. The results show that CS_DDoS yields the best performance when the LS-SVM classifier is adopted. It can detect DDoS TCP flood attacks with about 97% accuracy and with a Kappa coefficient of 0.89 when under attack from a single source, and 94% accuracy with a Kappa coefficient of 0.9 when under attack from multiple attackers. Finally, the results are discussed in terms of accuracy and time complexity, and validated using a K-fold cross-validation model.
The emerging trend of ubiquitous and pervasive computing aims at embedding everyday devices such as wristwatches, smart phones, home video systems, autofocus cameras, intelligent vehicles, musical instruments, kitchen appliances etc. with microprocessors and imparts them with wireless communication capability. This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier architecture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.
Companies and individuals are becoming more dependant on technology, automated processes, the Internet of Things (IoT) and daily use of internet, mobile devices, and other tools that the technological revolution has created. But against the back-drop of rapid technological progress, cyber-threats have become a serious challenge that require immediate, continuous action. As cyber-crime poses an ever-present and growing threat, corporate and individual users of the cyber-space are constantly struggling to ensure an acceptable level of security with respect to their assets. Based on an analysis of 4,785 attacks deployed world-wide in recent years, this paper outlines the correlations and patterns identified, with the final objective of defining security countermeasures that organisations from certain business sectors could implement in order to focus their limited resources and budget on mitigating the right risks.
The Internet and social media allow people to spread their views rapidly to a large group of people. While the right to freely express one's ideas and views is a cornerstone in a democratic society, in some cases the Internet can serve as a breeding ground for violent extremism and terrorism. Hence, in order to protect democracy, effective techniques of Internet surveillance are needed. Previous research has shown that there is a connection between word use and psychological states. The text analysis tool Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) counts words in psychologically meaningful categories. Based on the relative frequency of words from the different categories, conclusions can be drawn about the author of for instance a blog text. In this work, we have explored the characteristics of written communication produced by ten different lone offenders prior to their engagement in targeted violence. We found eight possible indicators of the drives and emotions that preceded their attacks.
The increasing use of the internet by minors has made public the risk they run of becoming victims of serious cyber-crime. This awareness has led to the adoption of binding and soft-law instruments in the field of International and EU law aimed at combating new forms of crime and protecting minors in the cyberspace. This paper, after having critically analysed the main acts adopted at International and EU level, focuses on their implementation in the Italian legal system. In doing so, cybercrimes committed by adults against children and those committed among peers will be separately considered. The study shows that, despite the legislator's attempt to carry out the obligations deriving from International and EU Law, there are still several critical profiles in the national law.
Identifying the model of a camera that has captured an image can be an important task in criminal investigations. Many methods assume that the image under analysis originates from a given set of known camera models. In practice, however, a photo can come from an unknown camera model, or its appearance could have been altered by unknown post-processing. In such a case, forensic detectors are prone to fail silently. One way to mitigate silent failures is to use a rejection mechanism for unknown examples. In this work, we propose Gaussian processes (GPs), which intrinsically provide such a rejection mechanism. This makes GPs a potentially powerful tool in multimedia forensics, where forensic analysts regularly work on images from unknown origins. We demonstrate that GPs scale well to the task of camera model identification. Probabilistic predictions from a GP classifier achieve high classification accuracy for known camera models while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. The built-in uncertainty estimates effectively tackle open-set camera model identification, outperforming two state-of-the-art methods.
FPGAs offer fast and reliable near-data processing and are therefore suitable candidates for implementing IoT and edge computing systems. As they are usually deployed in exposed locations, they are vulnerable to physical attacks, especially Side-Channel Analysis (SCA). In this paper, we characterize side-channels and how they can be exploited for SCA on FPGA-based off-the-shelf boards, i.e. without having to make any modifications to the board, hardware, or software. The basic requirement for any kind of SCA is that the individual Cryptographic Operations (COs) in the side-channel traces can be detected. To this end, we apply a SCA for semi-automatic CO detection that can be generically applied off-the-shelf to a wide variety of boards. Additionally, we introduce a new metric called Signal of COs to Noise Ratio (SCONR), that allows to quantify the pronouncedness of COs versus noise in a side channel. We then evaluate side channels measured on three different boards containing Xilinx 7 series FPGAs. We further investigate the influence of other sources of noise and how much they affect the attackability of a system. Our results show that FPGAs have a high vulnerability to SCA in general and that even noise from an operating system will not hinder the recording and finding of COs in an automated fashion as long as there are no countermeasures in place. Finally, SCONR converges after fewer recorded traces and gives a clearer indication whether a side channel is susceptible to this type of automated attack than leakage assessment techniques such as TVLA.
We introduce a new measure on regular languages: their non-deterministic syntactic complexity. It is the least degree of any extension of the 'canonical boolean representation' of the syntactic monoid. Equivalently, it is the least number of states of any subatomic nondeterministic acceptor. It turns out that essentially all previous structural work on non-deterministic state-minimality computes this measure. Our approach rests on an algebraic interpretation of nondeterministic finite automata as deterministic finite automata endowed with semilattice structure. Crucially, the latter form a self-dual category.
Cybersecurity incident analysis is an exploratory, data-driven process over records and logs from network monitoring tools. The process is rarely linear and frequently breaks down into multiple investigation branches. Analysts document all the steps and lessons learned and suggest mitigations. However, current tools provide only limited support for analytical provenance. As a result, analysts have to record all the details regarding the performed steps and notes in separate documents. Such a procedure increases their cognitive demands and is naturally error-prone. This paper proposes a conceptual design of the analytical tool implementing means of analytical provenance in cybersecurity incident analysis workflows. We identified the user requirements and designed and implemented a proof of concept prototype application Incident Analyzer. Qualitative feedback from four domain experts confirmed that our approach is promising and can significantly improve current cybersecurity and network incident analysis practices.
"The WTFast's Gamers Private Network (GPN (R)) is a client/server solution that makes online games faster. GPN (R) connects online video-game players with a common game service across a wide-area network. Online games are interactive competitions by individual players who compete in a virtual environment. Response time, latency and its predictability are keys to GPN (R) success and runs against the vast complexity of internet-wide systems. We have built an experimental network of virtualized GPN (R) components so as to carefully measure the statistics of latency for distributed Minecraft games and to do so in a controlled laboratory environment. This has led to a better understanding of the coupling between parameters such as: the number of players, the subset of players that are idle or active, the volume of packets exchanged, the size of packets, latency to and from the game servers, and time-series for most of those parameters. In this paper we present a mathematical model of those system game network parameters and show how it leads to: (1) realistic simulation of each of those network or game parameters, without relying on the experimental setup; (2) very large-scale numerical simulation of the game setup so as to explore various internet-wide performance scenarios that: (a) are impossible to isolate from internet noise in their real environment and; (b) would require vast supercomputing resources if they were to be simulated exhaustively. We motivate all elements of our mathematical model and estimate the savings in computational costs they will bring for very large-scale simulation of the GPN (R). Such simulations will improve quality of service for GPN (R) systems and their reliability."
Social networking sites have billions of users who communicate and share their personal information every day. Social engineering is considered one of the biggest threats to information security nowadays. Social engineering is an attacker technique to manipulate and deceive users in order to access or gain privileged information. Such attacks are continuously developed to deceive a high number of potential victims. The number of social engineering attacks has risen dramatically in the past few years, causing unpleasant damage both to organizations and individuals. Yet little research has discussed social engineering in the virtual environments of social networks. One approach to counter these exploits is through research that aims to understand why people fall victim to such attacks. Previous social engineering and deception research have not satisfactory identified the factors that influence the users' ability to detect attacks. Characteristics that influence users' vulnerability must be investigated to address this issue and help to build a profile for vulnerable users in order to focus on increasing the training programs and education for those users. In this context, the present study proposes a user-centric framework to understand the user's susceptibility, relevant factors and dimensions.
Webpages with terrorist and extremist content are key factors in the recruitment and radicalization of disaffected young adults who may then engage in terrorist activities at home or fight alongside terrorist groups abroad. This paper reports on advances in techniques for classifying data collected by the Terrorism and Extremism Network Extractor (TENE) web-crawler, a custom-written program that browses the World Wide Web, collecting vast amounts of data, retrieving the pages it visits, analyzing them, and recursively following the links out of those pages. The textual content is subjected to enhanced classification through software analysis, using the Posit textual analysis toolset, generating a detailed frequency analysis of the syntax, including multi-word units and associated part-of-speech components. Results are then deployed in a knowledge extraction process using knowledge extraction algorithms, e.g., from the WEKA system. Indications are that the use of the data enrichment through application of Posit analysis affords a greater degree of match between automatic and manual classification than previously attained. Furthermore, the incorporation and deployment of these technologies promises to provide public safety officials with techniques that can help to detect terrorist webpages, gauge the intensity of their content, discriminate between webpages that do or do not require a concerted response, and take appropriate action where warranted.
Ensuring the security of built-in apparatuses has become an important task because of advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Therefore, lightweight ciphers that are available in built-in apparatuses have attracted the attention of many researchers. However, the danger of electromagnetic analysis attacks against cryptographic circuits has been pointed out. Electromagnetic analysis attacks illegally analyze confidential information using the electromagnetic waves that are generated during the operation of a cryptographic circuit. Many studies have reported on power analysis attacks against the advanced encryption standard (AES). However, as far as we know, no study has reported on electromagnetic analysis attacks against PRINCE, which is one of the most popular lightweight ciphers. The present study proposes a method for electromagnetic analysis attacks against PRINCE in order to evaluate the tamper resistance of PRINCE. The present study also verifies the validity of the proposed method by performing an evaluation experiment using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).
As cybercriminals scale up their operations to increase their profits or inflict greater harm, we argue that there is an equal need to respond to their threats by scaling up cyber-security. To achieve this goal, we have to develop a co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising coproductive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon. We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and standardised in order to mitigate the paradox.
One of the main challenges in digital forensics is the increasing volume of data that needs to be analyzed. This problem has become even more pronounced with the emergence of big data and calls for a rethink on the way digital forensics investigations have been handled over the past years. This paper briefly discusses the challenges and needs of digital forensics in the face of the current trends and requirements of different investigations. A digital forensics analysis framework that puts into consideration the existing techniques as well as the current challenges is proposed. The purpose of the framework is to reassess the various stages of the digital forensics examination process and introduce into each stage the required techniques to enhance better collection, analysis, preservation and presentation in the face of big data and other challenges facing digital forensics.
Terrorism research has begun to focus on the issue of radicalization, or the acceptance of ideological belief systems that lead toward violence. There has been particular attention paid to the role of the Internet in the exposure to and promotion of radical ideas. There is, however, minimal work that attempts to model the ways that messages are spread or how individual participation in radical on-line communities operates. In this paper, we present a stochastic linear system to represent the evolution of contribution to a sample of 126 threads in an on-line forum where individuals discuss radical belief systems. To estimate or predict the time-varying contributions of agents for given online-forum data, each agent's contribution has been modeled as a state variable. We then use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to identify the model parameters including the adjacency matrix of the graph constructed among participating agents along with measurement and system uncertainty levels in online-postings. Our approach reveals the identified dynamical influences among agents in the time-varying shaping of the contribution in a data-driven fashion. We use the real-world data from online-postings to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, and its application toward on-line radicalization.
As the smartphone and the services it provides are becoming targets of cybercrime, it is critical to secure smartphones. However, it is important security controls are designed to provide continuous and userfriendly security. Amongst the most important of these is user authentication, where users have experienced a significant rise in the need to authenticate to the device and individually to the numerous apps that it contains. Gait authentication has gained attention as a mean of non-intrusive or transparent authentication on mobile devices, capturing the information required to verify the authenticity of the user whilst the person is walking. Whilst prior research in this field has shown promise with good levels of recognition performance, the results are constrained by the gait datasets utilised being based upon highly controlled laboratory-based experiments which lack the variability of real-life environments. This paper introduces an advanced real-world smartphone-based gait recognition system that recognises the subject within real-world unconstrained environments. The proposed model is applied to the uncontrolled gait dataset, which consists of 44 users over a 7-10 day capture - where users were merely asked to go about their daily activities. No conditions, controls or expectations of particular activities were placed upon the participants. The experiment has modelled four types of motion normal walking, fast walking and down and upstairs for each of the users. The evaluation of the proposed model has achieved an equal error rate of 11.38%, 11.32%, 24.52%, 27.33% and 15.08% for the normal, fast, down and upstairs and all activities respectively. The results illustrate, within an appropriate framework, that gait recognition is a viable technique for real-world use. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.
As cyber threats endanger everyone, from regular users to computing professionals, spreading cybersecurity awareness becomes increasingly critical. Therefore, our university designed an innovative cybersecurity awareness course that is freely available online for students, employees, and the general public. The course offers simple, actionable steps that anyone can use to implement defensive countermeasures. Compared to other resources, the course not only suggests learners what to do, but explains why and how to do it. To measure the course impact, we administered it to 138 computer science undergraduates within a compulsory information security and cryptography course. They completed the course as a part of their homework and filled out a questionnaire after each lesson. Analysis of the questionnaire responses revealed that the students valued the course highly. They reported new learning, perspective changes, and transfer to practice. Moreover, they suggested suitable improvements to the course. Based on the results, we have distilled specific insights to help security educators design similar courses. Lessons learned from this study are relevant for cybersecurity instructors, course designers, and educational managers.
Tampered multimedia content is being increasingly used in a broad range of cybercrime activities. The spread of fake news, misinformation, digital kidnapping, and ransomware-related crimes are amongst the most recurrent crimes in which manipulated digital photos and videos are the perpetrating and disseminating medium. Criminal investigation has been challenged in applying machine learning techniques to automatically distinguish between fake and genuine seized photos and videos. Despite the pertinent need for manual validation, easy-to-use platforms for digital forensics are essential to automate and facilitate the detection of tampered content and to help criminal investigators with their work. This paper presents a machine learning Support Vector Machines (SVM) based method to distinguish between genuine and fake multimedia files, namely digital photos and videos, which may indicate the presence of deepfake content. The method was implemented in Python and integrated as new modules in the widely used digital forensics application Autopsy. The implemented approach extracts a set of simple features resulting from the application of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to digital photos and video frames. The model was evaluated with a large dataset of classified multimedia files containing both legitimate and fake photos and frames extracted from videos. Regarding deepfake detection in videos, the Celeb-DFv1 dataset was used, featuring 590 original videos collected from YouTube, and covering different subjects. The results obtained with the 5-fold cross-validation outperformed those SVM-based methods documented in the literature, by achieving an average F1-score of 99.53%, 79.55%, and 89.10%, respectively for photos, videos, and a mixture of both types of content. A benchmark with state-of-the-art methods was also done, by comparing the proposed SVM method with deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Despite CNN having outperformed the proposed DFT-SVM compound method, the competitiveness of the results attained by DFT-SVM and the substantially reduced processing time make it appropriate to be implemented and embedded into Autopsy modules, by predicting the level of fakeness calculated for each analyzed multimedia file.
"Terrorist organizations pursue political goals, seeking to achieve them through violence. At the same time, communication remains one of the main aspects of their activities. Their propaganda, recruitment and searches for funding are not just in the digital arena, but also involve the use of a wide range of sophisticated technologies-new encryption tools, crypto currencies, operations in the darknet, etc. At the same time, more and more crimes are committed with the help of social engineering tools (psychological manipulation in order to induce a person to perform certain actions or share confidential information). Given the importance for terrorists of influencing the public consciousness, as well as the convergence of terrorism and cybercrime, terrorist organizations and lone-wolf terrorists can actively use the mechanisms of social engineering in their psychological operations. This threat to the psychological security of society (and in some cases, its physical security) is already a reality. It can become even more relevant due to the development and spread of AI technologies, which (if used maliciously) can facilitate the tasks of social engineering even for criminals without special technical knowledge. Much more dangerous may be a turn to terrorism by specialists who are able to develop AI tools that will initially be designed for psychological manipulation. This could be as simple as AI that offers a user content on certain topics in social media designed to surround the victim of recruitment with content that glorifies terrorism and persuade them to transfer money to a terrorist organization. This paper aims to find out the answers to four main research questions: 1) what are the current and future factors in the turn to terrorism of AI specialists; 2) how can existing and (possibly) future AI technologies make it easier for criminals to perform social engineering tasks; 3) how can terrorist organizations and lonewolf terrorists use social engineering tools through AI to achieve their goals; and 4) what means of countering this threat already exist and can be created in the future?"
The exposure of students to the internet and the digital world has increased many folds in the last two years because of the pandemic situations. A complete shift to online education and giving gadgets to every little hand was an emergency response to the world-wide lockdown situation.By choice or due to having no choice, the internet and virtual world have become an inseparable part of our lives now.The world is developing rapidly as a hub of technology, and it has affected out lives in exciting ways, but it has given rise to new problems also. We read news of misuse of social networking websites, cyber bullying, and online scams. There are cases of credit card scams, illegal downloads and copying, addiction of games to harmful level, viruses, pornography, and hate sites.With the increased exposure of children to the internet and the digital world, the cybercrimes against children are also increasing at an alarming rate. According to the latest National Crime Record Bureau data, there has been an increase of 400 percent in cybercrime against children in 2020 in comparison to 2019 in India. Now, it's time for us to think about what should be the do's and don'ts of this newly evolving world or in other words we can say that how to become digital citizens.Someone who has a place of its own in the digital world is called as a Digital Citizen. A digital citizenship comes with digital rights and responsibilities, which are for the purpose of protection of digital citizens.In this world full of technology, it is crucial to teach students about Digital Citizenship. In a world where students have devices like mobiles and tablets in their hands from infancy, it becomesvery important to train students for digital citizenship accordingly. This paper talks about the digital role and responsibilities of every digital citizen. This paper emphasises on the importance of the teacher's role to prepare digital citizens of tomorrow. It also talks about the content and methodology to teach digital citizenship.
Until recently, systems and networks have been designed to implement established actions within known contexts. However, gaining thehumantrust in system behavior requires development of artificial ethical agents proactively acting outside fixed context boundaries for mitigating dangerous situations in which other interacting entities find themselves. A proactive altruistic behavior oriented towards removing danger needs to rely on predictive awareness of a dangerous situation. Different that current approaches for designing cognitive architectures, in this paper, we introduce a method that enables the creation of artificial altruistic trusted behavior together with an architecture of the framework that enables its implementation.
Cyberattacks perpetrated by insiders are difficult to prevent using traditional security approaches. Often, such attackers misuse legitimate access to the system to conduct an attack, or an external attacker manipulates or masquerades as an insider to gain access, bypassing the security controls. A possible solution to this problem are forensic-ready software systems that support the eventual forensic investigation. For example, assuring that appropriate evidence of an attack would be generated and assessable if needed. While not primarily aimed at prevention, the controls of forensic-ready systems can be used to ensure reliable post-incident investigation in the case of an insider attack. Currently, however, there is a gap in adequate methods for identifying requirements and assessment of such systems. Therefore, we propose FR-ISSRM, a risk management approach to derive the forensic readiness requirements addressing insider attacks. The requirements, once implemented, assist in the reliable uncovering culprit, root cause, damage of the attack, and overall improvement of security posture. The approach is then demonstrated in three cases covering typical insider attacks.
Purpose Phishing attacks have evolved in recent years due to high-tech-enabled economic growth worldwide. The rise in all types of fraud loss in 2019 has been attributed to the increase in deception scams and impersonation, as well as to sophisticated online attacks such as phishing. The global impact of phishing attacks will continue to intensify, and thus, a more efficient phishing detection method is required to protect online user activities. To address this need, this study focussed on the design and development of a deep learning-based phishing detection solution that leveraged the universal resource locator and website content such as images, text and frames. Design/methodology/approach Deep learning techniques are efficient for natural language and image classification. In this study, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm were used to build a hybrid classification model named the intelligent phishing detection system (IPDS). To build the proposed model, the CNN and LSTM classifier were trained by using 1m universal resource locators and over 10,000 images. Then, the sensitivity of the proposed model was determined by considering various factors such as the type of feature, number of misclassifications and split issues. Findings An extensive experimental analysis was conducted to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the IPDS in detecting phishing web pages and phishing attacks when applied to large data sets. The results showed that the model achieved an accuracy rate of 93.28% and an average detection time of 25 s. Originality/value The hybrid approach using deep learning algorithm of both the CNN and LSTM methods was used in this research work. On the one hand, the combination of both CNN and LSTM was used to resolve the problem of a large data set and higher classifier prediction performance. Hence, combining the two methods leads to a better result with less training time for LSTM and CNN architecture, while using the image, frame and text features as a hybrid for our model detection. The hybrid features and IPDS classifier for phishing detection were the novelty of this study to the best of the authors' knowledge.
Phishers sometimes exploit users' trust of a known website's appearance by using a similar page that looks like the legitimate site. In recent times, researchers have tried to identify and classify the issues that can contribute to the detection of phishing websites. This study focuses on design and development of a deep learning based phishing detection solution that leverages the Universal Resource Locator and website content such as images and frame elements. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm were used to build a classification model. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 93.28%.
Purpose Computer games that teach cybersecurity concepts have been developed to help both individuals and organizations shore up their defence against cybercrimes. Evidence of the effectiveness of these games has been rather weak, however. This paper aims to guide the design and testing of more effective cybersecurity educational games by developing a theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature is conducted to explore the dependent variable of this research stream, learning outcomes and its relationship with four independent variables, game characteristics, game context, learning theory and user characteristics. Findings The dependent variable can be measured by five learning outcomes: information, content, strategic knowledge, eagerness to learn/time spent and behavioral change. Game characteristics refer to features that contribute to a game's usefulness, interactivity, playfulness or attractiveness. Game context pertains to factors that determine how a game is used, including the target audience, the skill involved and the story. Learning theory explains how learning takes place and can be classified as behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, social learning or constructivism. User characteristics including gender, age, computer experience, knowledge and perception, are attributes that can impact users' susceptibility to cybercrimes and hence learning outcomes. Originality/value The framework facilitates taking stock of past research and guiding future research. The use of the framework is illustrated in a critique of two research streams. Multiple research directions are discussed for continued research into the design and testing of next-generation cybersecurity computer games.
Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection. Overall, this paper paves way for an effective visual detection of malware using a scalable and hybrid deep learning framework for real-time deployments.
"<< SISMI-Telecom scandal >>, as it is known in Italy, is illegal phone tapping by some people in charge of security at the Telecom Italia Company. The case became common knowledge in September 2006 because 34 people were indicted and there were 21 provisional arrests among many employees at Telecom Italia, among national police and members of the Carabinieri Corps (paramilitary police of the Italian Armed Forces) and of the Guardia di Finanza (Inland Revenue Police)>>. In 2010, some journalists revealed what was happening and stated that thousands of people had been secretly put under unauthorised surveillance by Telecom Italia and illegal dossiers had been created. People's lives were monitored as well as their bank accounts; even the data banks of the Italian Ministry of the Interior were accessed. Ultimately, the SISMI-Telecom trial ended with very mild sentences between settlements and state secrets. Yet, in the information age, the SISMI-Telecom scandal can be considered dead only from a procedural point of view. According to the interpretation of some experts on the case, the famous law that has destroyed and ordered the destruction of those dossiers, is a suicide law because those files were all in electronic format, and of course continue to circulate and keep producing poisons."
Cybercrime in the past decade has experienced an all-time high due to the inclusion of so-called smart devices in our daily lives. These tiny devices with brittle security features are often dubbed as the Internet of Things (IoT). Their inclusion is not only limited to our daily lives but also in different fields, for example, healthcare, smart-industries, aviation, and smart-cities. Although IoT devices make our lives easy and perform our jobs in a smart way, but their fragile security mechanisms pose a severe challenge regarding safety and privacy of its users. Attacks like Stuxnet, and Mirai-botnet are the key examples of the damages that can be caused by maliciously controlling these devices. One effective tool to identify a malicious entity at a network device is to perform Remote Attestation (RA). However, performing RA over a large, heterogeneous IoT network is difficult tasks due to resource constrain nature of these networks. To this end, we propose a novel scheme called SARP, which is an attestation-assisted secure and scalable routing protocol for IoT networks. SARP performs attestation in large scale IoT networks by using Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) framework and exploiting the inbuilt features of RPL. In particular, SARP uses attestation technique that not only secures the network from internal attacks, but it also provides security to RPL's data communication process, which helps to improve the overall network performance. Moreover, SARP supports network mobility, device heterogeneity, and network scalability, while it does not sacrifice the key requirements of IoT networks such as low energy and memory consumption, and low network overhead. The simulation results obtained in different IoT scenarios in presence of various types of attacks show the effectiveness of SARP, concerning energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, network overhead, data integrity, and communication security.

Introduction. Current trends in the development of socio-economic processes aim at building the digital economy and society, but the spread of COVID-19 has exposed the major problems related to these processes. Problem Statement. The pandemic has defined a new fundamental and applied problem regarding the need to study crisis phenomena at the intersection of the number of research areas and their impact on economy and society. Purpose. The purpose is to analyze the state of the development and implementation of digital services in the country under the influence of quarantine restrictions. Materials and Methods. State legislative acts and statistical information have been selected as the information base. A number of methods of scientific inquiry have been applied: theoretical generalization, empirical analysis, comparison, abstraction, etc. Results. It has been defined that majority of the priority areas of digital economy development is being formed and not ready for their massive use. In particular, there still exists a significant inequality of access to digital services, the digital competency training system remains unregulated, the digital job creation scheme in the real economy is almost undeveloped, there are significant gaps in the digital public security services, the problem of the national digital educational platforms has not been resolved yet, the system of provision of remote healthcare services has not been formed, and the procedures for estimating tourist migration and for remote financial services have not been settled. Several problems that aggravated during the pandemic have been studied: the imperfection of social protection procedures, the existence of hidden unemployment, the activation of cybercrime, the aggravation of individual psychological problems, extremely high level of dependence on reliability of the network services. The directions for increasing financial results in the pandemic conditions have been identified. Conclusions. The pandemic has identified bottlenecks in the processes of the digital economy and society formation and allowed determining the priority areas in research and practical actions in order to adapt rapidly to new conditions.
"Image forgery is the intentional alteration of digital images, either manually using image editors or through deep fake techniques, for the purpose of disseminating fake information. We propose a forgery detection approach that efficiently detects copy-move and splicing attacks of varying scales in digital images. Our goal is to identify the homogeneous region(s) inconsistent with the rest of the image. This region property has been typically employed in object detection and classification, while we exploit this property to detect forgery in images. Thus, we generate the deep-derived features from the existing hand-crafted features in forgery detection as input to the VGG16, a deep learning method, trained for object classification. We use a binary class SVM trained on the obtained deep-derived features to determine whether an image is real or fake. We perform extensive experiments on three publicly available image manipulation datasets, DVMM, Casia and Korus to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results show a better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Background: Health care data breaches are the most rapidly increasing type of cybercrime; however, the predictors of health care data breaches are uncertain. Objective: This quantitative study aims to develop a predictive model to explain the number of hospital data breaches at the county level. Methods: This study evaluated data consolidated at the county level from 1032 short-term acute care hospitals. We considered the association between data breach occurrence (a dichotomous variable), predictors based on county demographics, and socioeconomics, average hospital workload, facility type, and average performance on several hospital financial metrics using 3 model types: logistic regression, perceptron, and support vector machine. Results: The model coefficient performance metrics indicated convergent validity across the 3 model types for all variables except bad debt and the factor level accounting for counties with >20% and up to 40% Hispanic populations, both of which had mixed coefficient directionality. The support vector machine model performed the classification task best based on all metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). All the 3 models performed the classification task well with directional congruence of weights. From the logistic regression model, the top 5 odds ratios (indicating a higher risk of breach) included inpatient workload, medical center status, pediatric trauma center status, accounts receivable, and the number of outpatient visits, in high to low order. The bottom 5 odds ratios (indicating the lowest odds of experiencing a data breach) occurred for counties with Black populations of >20% and <40%, >80% and <100%, and >40% but <60%, as well as counties with <= 20% Asian or between 80% and 100% Hispanic individuals. Our results are in line with those of other studies that determined that patient workload, facility type, and financial outcomes were associated with the likelihood of health care data breach occurrence. Conclusions: The results of this study provide a predictive model for health care data breaches that may guide health care managers to reduce the risk of data breaches by raising awareness of the risk factors."
Dynamic changes within the cyberspace are greatly impacting human lives and our societies. Emerging evidence indicates that without an ethical overlook on technological progress, intelligent solutions created to improve and enhance our lives can easily be turned against humankind. In complex AI-socio-technical ecosystems where humans, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and systems interact without a common language for building trust, this paper introduces a methodological concept of Ethical Digital Identities for supporting the ethical evaluation of intelligent digital assets.
The dynamic forces that transit back and forth traditional boundaries of system development have led to the emergence of digital ecosystems. Within these, business gains are achieved through the development of intelligent control that requires a continuous design and runtime co-engineering process endangered by malicious attacks. The possibility of inserting specially crafted faults capable to exploit the nature of unknown evolving intelligent behavior raises the necessity of malicious behavior detection at runtime. Adjusting to the needs and opportunities of fast AI development within digital ecosystems, in this paper, we envision a novel method and framework for runtime predictive evaluation of intelligent robots' behavior for assuring a cooperative safe adjustment.
"Internet technology keeps transforming the nature and processes of organizational goals because of its capacity to assist and enhance operational and managerial performance in both the business and non-business industries. However, the presence of cybersecurity threat and privacy issues have become rampant nowadays, considering the magnitude of digital-related transactions, particularly on internet banking systems. The harmful impact perceived from the said threats negatively affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information to financial institutions (bank) and its customers. Again, the perception formed out of this displeasure (cybersecurity threat) interferes with bank customer's decision process regarding the e-banking adoption (or engagement) and retention. In view of this, the present article seeks to; (1) review empirical constructs (cybersecurity threats) in the previous work regarding customer's perception of cybersecurity threats that impedes e-banking adoption and retention and (2) propose a conceptual framework depicting the direct and indirect relationship among the constructs studied. Since the present study is entirely based on a conceptual study, we deployed both document and content analysis as a composite technique for executing the general aim of the study. Findings show that knowledge of perceived identity theft, perceived impersonation, and perceived account hijacked are regarded as cybersecurity threats from the customer's viewpoint that impedes their e-banking adoption and retention. The review discovered that victims (bank customers) of such perceived threats are apparently skeptical in their quest to engage in e-banking adoption and retention. Similarly, the cybersecurity threat-related information, however, poses a danger to users and a sense of unwillingness to engage or retain in e- banking transaction space. Practically, the survival of every business largely depends on its customer base (retention), hence this study propels the financial institutions as a reminder to strategically strengthen their security and privacy concern inasmuch as cybercrime in the banking sector is concerned. In theory, the paper adds up to the concept of cybersecurity repercussion especially in the scope of internet banking. Limitations of this present study are highlighted in the concluding part of the entire paper."
The security of computer systems often relies upon decisions and actions of end users. In this paper, we set out to investigate users' susceptibility to cybercriminal attacks by concentrating at the most fundamental component governing user behavior-the human brain. We introduce a novel neuroscience-based study methodology to inform the design of user-centered security systems as it relates to cybercrime. In particular, we report on an functional magnetic resonance imaging study measuring users' security performance and underlying neural activity with respect to two critical security tasks: 1) distinguishing between a legitimate and a phishing website and 2) heeding security (malware) warnings. We identify the neural markers that might be controlling users' performance in these tasks, and establish relationships between brain activity and behavioral performance as well as between users' personality traits and security behavior. Our results provide a largely positive perspective on users' capability and performance vis-a-vis these crucial security tasks. First, we show that users exhibit significant brain activity in key regions associated with decision-making, attention, and problem-solving (phishing and malware warnings) as well as language comprehension and reading (malware warnings), which means that users are actively engaged in these security tasks. Second, we demonstrate that certain individual traits, such as impulsivity measured via an established questionnaire, are associated with a significant negative effect on brain activation in these tasks. Third, we discover a high degree of correlation in brain activity (in decision-making regions) across phishing detection and malware warnings tasks, which implies that users' behavior in one task may potentially be predicted by their behavior in the other. Fourth, we discover high functional connectivity among the core regions of the brain, while users performed the phishing detection task. Finally, we discuss the broader impacts and implications of our work on the field of user-centered security, including the domain of security education, targeted security training, and security screening.

Phishing is a social engineering cyberattack where criminals deceive users to obtain their credentials through a login form that submits the data to a malicious server. In this paper, we compare machine learning and deep learning techniques to present a method capable of detecting phishing websites through URL analysis. In most current state-of-the-art solutions dealing with phishing detection, the legitimate class is made up of homepages without including login forms. On the contrary, we use URLs from the login page in both classes because we consider it is much more representative of a real case scenario and we demonstrate that existing techniques obtain a high false-positive rate when tested with URLs from legitimate login pages. Additionally, we use datasets from different years to show how models decrease their accuracy over time by training a base model with old datasets and testing it with recent URLs. Also, we perform a frequency analysis over current phishing domains to identify different techniques carried out by phishers in their campaigns. To prove these statements, we have created a new dataset named Phishing Index Login URL (PILU-90K), which is composed of 60K legitimate URLs, including index and login websites, and 30K phishing URLs. Finally, we present a Logistic Regression model which, combined with Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) feature extraction, obtains 96.50% accuracy on the introduced login URL dataset.
"Nowadays, the speed up development and use of digital devices such as smartphones have put people at risk of internet crimes. The evidence of present crimes in a computer file can be easily unreachable by changing the prefix of a file or other algorithms. In more complex cases, either file divided into different parts or the parts of a file that has information about the file type are deleted, where the file fragment recognition issue is discussed. The known files are divided into different fragments, and different classification algorithms are used to solve the problems of file fragment recognition. A confusion matrix measures the accuracy of type recognition. The issue of identifying the type of file fragment due to its importance in cybercrime issues as well as antivirus has been highly emphasized and has been addressed in many articles. Increasing the accuracy in this field on the types of widely used files due to the sensitivity of the subject of recognizing the type of file under study is the main goal of researchers in this field. Failure to identify the correct type of file will lead to deviations of the results and evidence from the main issue or failure to conclude. In this paper, first, the file is divided into different fragments. Then, the file fragment features, which are obtained from Binary Frequency Distribution (BFD), are reduced by 2 feature reduction algorithms; Sequential Forward Selection algorithm (SFS) as well as Sequential Floating Forward Selection algorithm (SFFS) to delete sparse features that result in increased accuracy and speed. Finally, the reduced features are given to 3 Multiclass classifier algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for classification and comparison of the results. The proposed recognition algorithm can recognize 6 types of useful files (PDF, TXT, JPG, DOC, HTML, EXE) and may distinguish a type of file fragments with higher accuracy than the similar works done."
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - around fourteen years old vulnerability is still on the rise and a continuous threat to the web applications. Only last year, 150505 defacements (this is a least, an XSS can do) have been reported and archived in Zone-H (a cybercrime archive) (http://www.zone-h.org/). The online WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) or rich-text editors are now a days an essential component of the web applications. They allow users of web applications to edit and enter HTML rich text (i.e., formatted text, images, links and videos etc.) inside the web browser window. The web applications use WYSIWYG editors as a part of comment functionality, private messaging among users of applications, blogs, notes, forums post, spellcheck as-you-type, ticketing feature, and other online services. The XSS in WYSIWYG editors is considered more dangerous and exploitable because the user-supplied rich-text contents (may be dangerous) are viewable by other users of web applications. In this paper, we present a security analysis of twenty (20) popular WYSIWYG editors powering thousands of web sites. The analysis includes WYSIWYG editors like Enterprise TinyMCE, EditLive, Lithium, Jive, TinyMCE, PHP HTML Editor, markItUp! universal markup jQuery editor, FreeTextBox (popular ASP. NET editor), Froala Editor, elRTE, and CKEditor. At the same time, we also analyze rich-text editors available on very popular sites like Twitter, Yahoo Mail, Amazon, GitHub and Magento and many more. In order to analyze online WYSIWYG editors, this paper also present a systematic and WYSIWYG editors's specific XSS attack methodology. We apply the XSS attack methodology on online WYSIWYG editors and found XSS is all of them. We show XSS bypasses for old and modern browsers. We have responsibly reported our findings to the respective developers of editors and our suggestions have been added. In the end, we also point out some recommendations for the developers of web applications and WYSIWYG editors.
In current business practices, majority of organizations rely heavily on digital devices such as computers, generic media, cell phones, network systems, and the internet to operate and improve their business. Thus, a large amount of information is produced, accumulated, and distributed via electronic means. Consequently, government and company interests in cyberspace and private networks become vulnerable to cyberspace threats. The investigation of crimes involving the use of digital devices is classified under digital forensics which involves adoption of practical frameworks and methods to recover data for analysis which can serve as evidence in court. However, cybercrime has advanced to the stage where criminals try to cover their tracks through the use of anti-forensic strategies such as data overwriting and data hiding. Research into anti-forensics has given rise to the concept of 'live' forensics which comprises proactive forensics approaches capable of digitally investigating an incident as it occurs. However, information exchange using ICT facilities has reduced the world into a global village without eliminating the linguistic diversity on the planet. Moreover, existing digital forensics frameworks have assumed the language of stored information. If such assumption turns out to be wrong, semantic interpretation of extracted text would also be wrong leading to wrong conclusions. We propose incorporation of language identification (LID) in digital forensics investigation (DFI) models in order to help law enforcement to be a step ahead of criminals. In this chapter, we outline issues of language identification in DFI frameworks and propose a new framework with language identification component. The LID component is to carry out digital surveillance by scrutinizing emails, SMS, and text file transfers, in and out of the system of interest. The collected text is then subjected to language identification. Determining the language of the text would help to decide if the communication is regular and safe or suspicious and should be subjected to further forensic analysis. Finally we discuss results from a simple language identification scheme that can be easily and quickly integrated to a DFI model yielding very high accuracy without compromising speed performance.
This work addresses the challenge of discerning non-exact or non-obvious similarities between cybercrimes, proposing a new approach to finding linkages and repetitions across cases in a cyber-investigation context using near similarity calculation of distinctive digital traces. A prototype system was developed to test the proposed approach, and the system was evaluated using digital traces collected during actual cyber-investigations. The prototype system also links cases on the basis of exact similarity between technical characteristics. This work found that the introduction of near similarity helps to confirm already existing links, and exposes additional linkages between cases. Automatic detection of near similarities across cybercrimes gives digital investigators a better understanding of the criminal context and the actual phenomenon, and can reveal a series of related offenses. Using case data from 207 cyber-investigations, this study evaluated the effectiveness of computing similarity between cases by applying string similarity algorithms to email addresses. The Levenshtein algorithm was selected as the best algorithm to segregate similar email addresses from non-similar ones. This work can be extended to other digital traces common in cybercrimes such as URLs and domain names. In addition to finding linkages between related cybercrime at a technical level, similarities in patterns across cases provided insights at a behavioral level such as modus operandi (MO). This work also addresses the step that comes after the similarity computation, which is the linkage verification and the hypothesis formation. For forensic purposes, it is necessary to confirm that a near match with the similarity algorithm actually corresponds to a real relation between observed characteristics, and it is important to evaluate the likelihood that the disclosed similarity supports the hypothesis of the link between cases. This work recommends additional information, including certain technical, contextual and behavioral characteristics that could be collected routinely in cyber-investigations to support similarity computation and link evaluation.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates the annual cost from cybercrime to be more than $400 billion. Most notable is the recent digital identity thefts that compromised millions of accounts. These attacks emphasize the security problems of using clonable static information. One possible solution is the use of a physical device known as a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF). PUFs can be used to create encryption keys, generate random numbers, or authenticate devices. While the concept shows promise, current PUF implementations are inherently problematic: inconsistent behavior, expensive, susceptible to modeling attacks, and permanent. Therefore, we propose a new solution by which an unclonable, dynamic digital identity is created between two communication endpoints such as mobile devices. This Physically Unclonable Digital ID (PUDID) is created by injecting a data scrambling PUF device at the data origin point that corresponds to a unique and matching descrambler/hardware authentication at the receiving end. This device is designed using macroscopic, intentional anomalies, making them inexpensive to produce. PUDID is resistant to cryptanalysis due to the separation of the challenge-response pair and a series of hash functions. PUDID is also unique in that by combining the PUF device identity with a dynamic human identity, we can create true two-factor authentication. We also propose an alternative solution that eliminates the need for a PUF mechanism altogether by combining tamper resistant capabilities with a series of hash functions. This tamper resistant device, referred to as a Quasi-PUDID (Q-PUDID), modifies input data, using a black-box mechanism, in an unpredictable way. By mimicking PUF attributes, Q-PUDID is able to avoid traditional PUF challenges thereby providing high-performing physical identity assurance with or without a low performing PUF mechanism. Three different application scenarios with mobile devices for PUDID and Q-PUDID have been analyzed to show their unique advantages over traditional PUFs and outline the potential for placement in a host of applications.
Cyber defense exercises (CDXs) represent an effective way to train cybersecurity experts. However, their development is lengthy and expensive. The reason lies in current practice where the CDX life cycle is not sufficiently mapped and formalized, and then exercises are developed ad-hoc. However, the CDX development shares many aspects with software development, especially with ERP systems. This paper presents a generic CDX development method that has been derived from existing CDX life cycles using the SPEM standard meta-model. The analysis of the method revealed bottlenecks in the CDX development process. Observations made from the analysis and discussed in the paper indicate that the organization of CDXs can be significantly optimized by applying a balanced mixed approach with agile preparation and plan-driven disciplined evaluation.
Software ecosystems are considered the natural evolution of software product lines. A software ecosystem provides a (software) product within a particular business and organizational context that supports the exchange of activities and services within a domain. However, the increasing degree of autonomy demanded by software ecosystems is elevating the system response to end users, while the existing software ecosystem architectures are not well prepared to deal with the dynamicity of context changes and autonomous behavior needs. In order to provide a transition toward an increased level of autonomy, in this article, we introduce the notion of autonomous dynamic ecosystems as representative of those software ecosystems able to support dynamic, smart, and autonomous features demanded by modern software systems. In this work, we further investigate and provide evidence of four industrial examples that have fully embodied the principles of autonomous dynamic ecosystems, and we characterize the main features and technology requirements of this kind of new ecosystems.
Purpose: Knowledge risks are increasingly becoming a great challenge to a variety of organizations. At the same time, academic research on such types of risks, their consequences, and potential ways of overcoming them is still scarce and fragmented. To fill this gap, the paper aims to find out do companies manage their knowledge risks, what are the possible knowledge risks they face and have they observed an increase of knowledge risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper is aimed to present insights on different types of knowledge risks that organizations face, and the ways organizations handle them. The paper also proposes some potential countermeasures organizations might use to mitigate the consequences of knowledge risks. Methodology: The study presents the results of a quantitative survey performed among 60 professionals dealing with management and knowledge risks in organizations. In the study, the authors also have examined what tools and methods are used to manage these risks. The study also explores the level of readiness organizations have to address potential knowledge risks. Findings: The theoretical study has allowed us to identify a variety of knowledge risks, which can bear severe consequences for organizations, such as knowledge loss, knowledge leaking, knowledge hiding, or risks related to cybercrime. All these risks may potentially reduce the productivity in organizations, thus leading to the degradation of organizational performance. Research limitations: Research results are limited to the convenience sample that was selected for the study and thus may not give a comprehensive overview of the state of the art. Practical implications: The study provides useful insights for managers and owners of organizations in need of dealing with the knowledge risks in their organizations. The paper is enriched with a number of sample solutions that they may apply for the sake of their organization. Originality/value: The paper lays the ground for a better understanding of the knowledge risks that organizations need to face nowadays. As such, the paper offers food for thought for researchers dealing with the topic of knowledge risks, knowledge management, and organizational risk management in general.
Cybersecurity training is a key endeavour for ensuring that the IT workforce possess the knowledge and practical skills required to counter the ever-increasing cybersecurity threats that our society is faced with. While some related systems, such as Capture The Flag platforms, have been available for almost one decade, platforms that support full-fledged cybersecurity training exercises have only been released as open source in recent years. Given the complexity of such cybersecurity training platforms, the ques-tion that arises is how to meaningfully evaluate and compare their capabilities in order to identify the most suitable solution for a given type of organization and/or training activity. In this paper, we intro-duce a capability assessment methodology for cybersecurity training platforms that focuses on the three key aspects of training: content representation, environment management, and training facilitation. The assessment tool that we developed is used to evaluate two open-source cybersecurity training platforms, CyTrONE and ICYPO. We then conduct a comparative analysis of these two platforms based on our first-hand developer experience with them, and discuss the lessons learned from implementing, deploying and using these platforms. The assessment tool and the detailed technical comparative analysis that we conducted are intended as instruments and references for anyone who plans to deploy or develop cyber-security training platforms.

Hands-on training is an effective way to practice theoretical cybersecurity concepts and increase participants' skills. In this article, we discuss the application of visual analytics principles to the design, execution, and evaluation of training sessions. We propose a conceptual model employing visual analytics that supports the sensemaking activities of users involved in various phases of the training life cycle. The model emerged from our long-term experience in designing and organizing diverse hands-on cybersecurity training sessions. It provides a classification of visualizations and can be used as a framework for developing novel visualization tools supporting phases of the training life-cycle. We demonstrate the model application on examples covering two types of cybersecurity training programs.
Trust is a fundamental aspect in enabling selfadaptation of intelligent systems and in paving the way towards a smooth adoption of technological innovations in our societies. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable to uplift the human contribution to our societies while protecting environmental resources, its ethical and technical trust dimensions bring significant challenges for a sustainable self-adaptive evolution in the domain of safety-critical systems. Inspired from the safety assurance case, in this paper we introduce the concept of trust assurance case together with the implementation of its ethical and technical principles directed towards assuring a trustworthy sustainable evolution of safety-critical AI-controlled systems.
The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool is a robust decision-making technique utilized in several fields like networking, risk management, digital analysis, cybercrime investigation, artificial intelligence, waste management enterprises and many other selection criteria. Complex SFS (CSFS) is a new edition of the spherical fuzzy set (SFS) that offers substantial information about any item in terms of amplitude and phase terms in a wider range of real terms. Complex SFS (CSFS) can be an extension of the spherical fuzzy set (SFS). The Aczel-Alsina aggregation tools are more appropriate aggregation operators (AOs), and they are used to conquer the impact of inconsistent and uncertain data. In this paper, we reveal some new approaches based on AczelAlsina aggregation tools under consideration of Complex Spherical Fuzzy (CSF) information. These new approaches include the CSF Aczel-Alsina weighted average (CSFAWA) operator, and the CSF Aczel-Alsina ordered weighted average (CSFOWA) operator. In addition to this, we also introduce a list of novel techniques by making use of the theory of Aczel-Alsina aggregation tools such as CSF Aczel-Alsina weighted geometric (CSFAWG) and CSF Aczel-Alsina ordered weighted geometric (CSFOWG) operators. To demonstrate the resilience and efficacy of the approaches that have been mentioned, we will examine a few exceptional examples and remarkable properties of the methodology that we have devised. In addition, a characterization is provided for an approach to the MCDM issue using the CPF information system. We use the example of electric automobiles as a case study to illustrate the uniformity and dependability of the methodology that we have established. This example was chosen because of the high cost of fuel and the present economic challenges that are being encountered by families in the middle class. An empirical case study is also constructed to determine an electric car that is desirable based on the techniques that we have proposed. To evaluate the correctness and superiority of the established strategies, we compare the outcomes of previously used techniques with the AOs currently being provided.
Cybercrime has become more pervasive and sophisticated over the years. Cyber ranges have emerged as a solution to keep pace with the rapid evolution of cybersecurity threats and attacks. Cyber ranges have evolved to virtual environments that allow various IT and network infrastructures to be simulated to conduct cybersecurity exercises in a secure, flexible, and scalable manner. With these training environments, organizations or individuals can increase their preparedness and proficiency in cybersecurity-related tasks while helping to maintain a high level of situational awareness. SPIDER is an innovative cyber range as a Service (CRaaS) platform for 5G networks that offer infrastructure emulation, training, and decision support for cybersecurity-related tasks. In this paper, we present the integration in SPIDER of defensive exercises based on the utilization of machine learning models as key components of attack detectors. Two recently appeared network attacks, cryptomining using botnets of compromised devices and vulnerability exploit of the DoH protocol (DNS over HTTP), are used as the support use cases for the proposed exercises in order to exemplify the way in which other attacks and the corresponding ML-based detectors can be integrated into SPIDER defensive exercises. The two attacks were emulated, respectively, to appear in the control and data planes of a 5G network. The exercises use realistic 5G network traffic generated in a new environment based on a fully virtualized 5G network. We provide an in-depth explanation of the integration and deployment of these exercises and a complete walkthrough of them and their results. The machine learning models that act as attack detectors are deployed using container technology and standard interfaces in a new component called Smart Traffic Analyzer (STA). We propose a solution to integrate STAs in a standardized way in SPIDER for the use of trainees in exercises. Finally, this work proposes the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to obtain on-demand synthetic flow-based network traffic that can be seamlessly integrated into SPIDER exercises to be used instead of real traffic and attacks.
"Whereas the use of technology in organizations has many advantages, it also provides employees with new outlets to engage in technology-enabled forms of workplace deviance. This chapter examines various forms of cyber misbehavior through the lens of the four primary dimensions of workplace deviance put forth by Robinson and Bennett (1995). We also expand on Robinson and Bennett's (1995) classic model of workplace deviance by discussing features unique to cyberdeviance engagement. A review of both individual- and organization-directed forms of cyberdeviance is provided, including cyberbullying, online incivility, cyberloafing, and cybercrime. A brief discussion of the known antecedents and outcomes for each construct, as well as recommendations for applied practice and future research are provided. Whereas the introduction of new technology provides many opportunities for organizational growth and development, it also presents new means for employees to engage in various types of workplace misbehavior. Workplace cyberdeviance, which is employee misbehavior conducted using electronic means, is important for organizations to address, as it can result in a number of negative outcomes for both organizations and employees. Notably, because of differences in online and offline contexts, cyberdeviance may not simply be the manifestation of offline workplace deviance in an online realm. For instance, online interpersonal communication differs from offline communication in several key ways: (a) messages are text-based, (b) there can be multiple recipients, (c) communication can be easily forwarded to others, (d) there may be a greater risk for misinterpretation due to missing paralinguistic information, and (e) source anonymity may be possible (Kowalski, Limber, & Agatston, 2008; Kruger, Epley, Parker, & Ng, 2005; Privitera & Campbell, 2009). Likewise, non-communicative online behaviors can differ from non-communicative offline behaviors in that online misbehavior can occur at other geographic locations without the perpetrator being present, and some forms of online misbehavior require a high level of technical expertise. Thus, although workplace cyberdeviance shares many commonalities with offline workplace deviance, a special consideration of the unique features of cyberdeviance is warranted. In this chapter, we will first introduce the topic of workplace deviance, followed by a more detailed discussion of workplace cyberdeviance."
Zero-rating is a practice of electronic communication network operators whereby they offer certain apps and services that do not count toward a consumer's monthly data allowance. Over the past few years, the legality of this practice has become one of the most disputed when it comes to the greater regulatory regime. Even though significant case law has emerged, and regulators have made meaningful efforts, there have been unexpected developments in established approaches to such regulation. Consequently, there is uncertainty as to the proper regulatory regime for this practice. Average consumers might be quick to say that zero-rating is a great benefit, but there are other important factors that must be evaluated before giving the final word about the regulation of zero-rating practices. Zero-rating practices reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the Internet and the digital economy. Therefore, it must be analyzed from various perspectives. First, zero-rating can be examined within the net neutrality debate and from the competition law perspective. However, there are also implications in other areas like consumer protection and content diversity, and even human rights. This paper attempts to highlight major controversies surrounding the zero-rating debate in order to provide a regulatory proposal that could address this practice.
"Machine learning-based (ML) malware detectors have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial malware examples. Given the vulnerability of deep learning detectors to small changes on the input file, we propose a practical and certifiable defense against patch and append attacks on malware detection. Our defense is inspired by the concept of (de)randomized smoothing, a certifiable defense against patch attacks on image classifiers, which we adapt by: (1) presenting a novel chunk-based smoothing scheme that operates on subsequences of bytes within an executable; (2) deriving a certificate that measures the robustness against patch attacks and append attacks. Our approach works as follows: (i) during the training phase, a base classifier is trained to make classifications on a subset of contiguous bytes or chunk of bytes from an executable; (ii) at test time, an executable is divided into non-overlapping chunks of fixed size and our detection system classifies the original executable as the majority vote over the predicted classes of the chunks. Leveraging the fact that patch and append attacks can only influence a certain number of chunks, we derive meaningful large robustness certificates against both attacks. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have trained a classifier with our chunk-based scheme on the BODMAS dataset. We show that the proposed chunk-based smoothed classifier is more robust against the benign injection attack and state-of-the-art evasion attacks in comparison to a non-smoothed classifier."
Trust is a major aspect in the relationship between humans and autonomous safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles. Although human errors may cause higher risks, failures of autonomous systems are more strongly perceived by the general population, which hinders the adoption of autonomous safety-critical systems. It is therefore necessary to devise approaches for systematically building trust in autonomous functions and thereby facilitate the adoption process. In this paper, we introduce a method and a framework for incrementally building trust in the context of autonomous driving. Within the envisioned solution, we employ the psychological narrative behind trust building through the formation of new habits and introduce a method where trust is established gradually for both the human and the autonomous safety-critical system via reputation building and step-by-step integration of smart software agents replacing human actions.
Achieving situational awareness is a challenging process in current HTTPS-dominant web traffic. In this paper, we propose a new approach to encrypted web traffic monitoring. First, we design a method for correlating host-based and network monitoring data based on their common features and a correlation time-window. Then we analyze the correlation results in detail to identify configurations of web servers and monitoring infrastructure that negatively affect the correlation. We describe these properties and possible data preprocessing techniques to minimize their impact on correlation performance. Furthermore, to test the correlation method's behavior in different web server setups and for recent encryption protocols, we modify it by adapting the correlation features to TLS 13 and QUIC. Finally, we evaluate the correlation method on a dataset collected from a campus network. The results show that while the correlation requires monitoring of custom event and flow features, it remains feasible even when using encryption protocols designed for the near future.
Storage resources are usually organized in abstraction layers in computing systems where higher level storage (e.g. files or file systems) is constructed from lower level storage (e.g. disk volumes). Many forensic storage reconstruction techniques exist that gather data at lower layers and interpret this data to reconstruct higher layers. On the one hand, there are metadata-based reconstruction techniques that interpret metadata structures to precisely reconstruct upper layer content. On the other hand, there are pattern-based techniques (carving) that focus mainly on deleted files that cannot be reconstructed by other methods. Instances resembling the former approach are Carrier's The Sleuth Kit (TSK) as well as many commercial tools, while the latter approach is used by file carvers like Foremost and Scalpel. Based on a formalization of storage abstraction layers, we show that all these techniques can be unified within a modular reconstruction framework. We define composition operators that allow to precisely express complex reconstruction tasks that involve both metadata-based and pattern-based techniques and allow to combine their respective strengths seamlessly in forensic analysis. We present LAYR, an implementation of our approach and show that it can automatically and reliably combine different reconstruction approaches. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

With the alarmingly increasing rate of cybercrimes worldwide, there is a dire need to combat cybercrimes timely and effectively. Cyberattacks on computing machines leave certain artifacts on target device storage that can reveal the identity and behavior of cyber-criminals if processed and analyzed intelligently. Forensic agencies and law enforcement departments use several digital forensic toolkits, both commercial and open-source, to examine digital evidence. The proposed research survey focuses on identifying the current state-of-the-art digital forensics concepts in existing research, sheds light on research gaps, presents a detailed introduction of different computer forensic domains and forensic toolkits used for computer forensics in the current era. The proposed survey also presents a comparative analysis based on the tool's characteristics to facilitate investigators in tool selection during the forensics process. Finally, the proposed survey identifies and derives current challenges and future research directions in computer forensics.
In our paper, we describe the landscape that has led to the realization from the nineties of the last century that cyber is a social good: Cyber is a social good, said Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly. It's about societal resilience. And my last message (at CES 2023) is that we need to fundamentally change the relationship between government and industry. This realization is build upon the belief that trust can be reinvented on three levels: that of data chains in devices, information chains in the supply chain (can I trust my supplier, my client), and trust in the realness, the 'reality' level of the contexts evoked by these chains in an age of deep fakes, Chat GPT and the Metaverse. We argue that there is a crisis of trust on all levels, a crisis which inevitability is part of the digital turn itself. As we move, as Mark Weiser wrote in his seminal text The Computer for the 21st century, to a form of computing that will disappear into the fabric of everyday life, and will only succeed as a success when it disappears fully from the experience of humans. It is the infrastructure itself that acquires a new layer and becomes 'smart'. It has become an integral part of society that was before governed by rules of the kinetic realities of the world. These rules were built with certain threats in mind. The hybrid reality, layers of analogue/kinetic that interact sometimes, leads to new everyday practices that become social behavior. Leveling new threats then indeed becomes a social good. We argue that this is especially the case for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who by forming 99% of all business in Europe, not only pose a large fragmented threat vector, but also they are fighting cybercrime in isolation. We purpose a novel solution to exchange cybersecurity risk information with context among SMEs in a peer to peer mesh network. Additionally, a graph based risk analysis and prioritization method which takes into account the context information of assets and their environment.
Information theft or data exfiltration, whether personal or corporate, is now a lucrative mainstay of cybercrime activity. Recent security reports have suggested that while information, such as credit card data is still a prime target, other data such as corporate secrets, employee files and intellectual property are increasingly sought after on the black market. Malicious actors that are intent on exfiltrating valuable data, usually employ some form of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) in order to exfiltrate large amounts of data over a long period of time with a high degree of covertness. Botnet's are prime examples of APTs that are usually established on targeted systems through malware or exploit kits that leverage system vulnerabilities. Once established, Botnet's rely on covert command and control (C&C) communications with a central server, this allows a malicious actor to keep track of compromised systems and to send out instructions for compromised systems to do their biding. Covert channels provide an ideal mechanism for data exfiltration and the exchange of command and control messages that are essential to a Botnet's effectiveness. Our work focuses on one particular form of covert channel that enables communication of hidden messages over normal Domain Name Server (DNS) network traffic. Covert channels based on DNS traffic are of particular interest, as DNS requests are an essential part of most Internet traffic and as a result are rarely filtered or blocked by firewalls. As part of our work we have created a test bed system that uses a covert DNS channel to exfiltrate data from a compromised host. Using this system we have carried out network traffic analysis that uses baseline comparisons as a means to fingerprint covert DNS activity. Even though detection of covert DNS activity is relatively straightforward, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that most organizations do not filter or pay enough attention to DNS traffic and are therefore susceptible to data exfiltration attacks once a host on their network has been compromised. Our work shows that freely available covert DNS tools have particular traffic signatures that can be detected in order to mitigate data exfiltration and C&C traffic.
In this paper we present an attack, which allows fraudulent transactions to be collected from EMV contactless credit and debit cards without the knowledge of the cardholder. The attack exploits a previously unreported vulnerability in EMV protocol, which allows EMV contactless cards to approve unlimited value transactions without the cardholder's PIN when the transaction is carried out in a foreign currency. For example, we have found that Visa credit cards will approve foreign currency transactions for any amount up to (sic)999,999.99 without the cardholder's PIN, this side-steps the 20 pound contactless transaction limit in the UK. This paper outlines our analysis methodology that identified the flaw in the EMV protocol, and presents a scenario in which fraudulent transaction details are transmitted over the Internet to a rogue merchant who then uses the transaction data to take money from the victim's account. In reality, the criminals would choose a value between (sic)100 and (sic)200, which is low enough to be within the victim's balance and not to raise suspicion, but high enough to make each attack worthwhile. The attack is novel in that it could be operated on a large scale with multiple attackers collecting fraudulent transactions for a central rogue merchant which can be located anywhere in the world where EMV payments are accepted.
Recognizing the need for proactive analysis of cyber adversary behavior, this paper presents a new event-driven simulation model and implementation to reveal the efforts needed by attackers who have various entry points into a network. Unlike previous models which focus on the impact of attackers' actions on the defender's infrastructure, this work focuses on the attackers' strategies and actions. By operating on a request-response session level, our model provides an abstraction of how the network infrastructure reacts to access credentials the adversary might have obtained through a variety of strategies. We present the current capabilities of the simulator by showing three variants of Bronze Butler APT on a network with different user access levels.
"BackgroundIncreased digitalization of healthcare comes along with the cost of cybercrime proliferation. This results to patients' and healthcare providers' skepticism to adopt Health Information Technologies (HIT). In Europe, this shortcoming hampers efficient cross-border health data exchange, which requires a holistic, secure and interoperable framework. This study aimed to provide the foundations for designing a secure and interoperable toolkit for cross-border health data exchange within the European Union (EU), conducted in the scope of the KONFIDO project. Particularly, we present our user requirements engineering methodology and the obtained results, driving the technical design of the KONFIDO toolkit.MethodsOur methodology relied on four pillars: (a) a gap analysis study, reviewing a range of relevant projects/initiatives, technologies as well as cybersecurity strategies for HIT interoperability and cybersecurity; (b) the definition of user scenarios with major focus on cross-border health data exchange in the threepilot countries of the project; (c) a user requirements elicitation phase containing a threat analysis of the business processes entailed in the user scenarios, and (d) surveying and discussing with key stakeholders, aiming to validate the obtained outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators for HIT adoption linked with cybersecurity and interoperability.ResultsAccording to the gap analysis outcomes, full adherence with information security standards is currently not universally met. Sustainability plans shall be defined for adapting existing/evolving frameworks to the state-of-the-art. Overall, lack of integration in a holistic security approach was clearly identified. For each user scenario, we concluded with a comprehensive workflow, highlighting challenges and open issues for their application in our pilot sites. The threat analysis resulted in a set of 30 user goals in total, documented in detail. Finally, indicative barriers of HIT acceptance include lack of awareness regarding HIT risks and legislations, lack of a security-oriented culture and management commitment, as well as usability constraints, while important facilitators concern the adoption of standards and current efforts for a common EU legislation framework.ConclusionsOur study provides important insights to address secure and interoperable health data exchange, while our methodological framework constitutes a paradigm for investigating diverse cybersecurity-related risks in the health sector."
As one of the most pervasive current modes of communication, email needs to be fast and reliable. However, spammers and attackers use it as a primary channel to conduct illegal activities. Although many approaches have been developed and evaluated for spam detection, they do not provide sufficient accuracy. This deficiency results in significant economic losses for organizations. In this article, we first propose a framework for creating novel spam filters using Keras to combine a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classification models. We then use this framework to introduce a specific solution applicable to realistic scenarios involving dynamic incoming email data in real-time. This solution takes the form of a real-time content-based spam classifier. We evaluate its performance concerning accuracy, precision, recall, false-positive, and false-negative rates. Our experimental results show that our approach can significantly outperform existing solutions for real-time spam detection.
Contemporary challenges for efficient similarity search include complex similarity functions, the curse of dimensionality, and large sizes of descriptive features of data objects. This article reports our experience with a database of protein chains which form (almost) metric space and demonstrate the following extreme properties. Evaluation of the pairwise similarity of protein chains can take even tens of minutes, and has a variance of six orders of magnitude. The minimisation of a number of similarity comparisons is thus crucial, so we propose a generic three stage search engine to solve it. We improve the median searching time 73 times in comparison with the search engine currently employed for the protein database in practice.
Data breaches remain a common occurrence affecting both companies and individuals alike, despite promulgated data protection legislation worldwide. It is unlikely that factors causing data breaches such as incorrect device configuration or negligence will stop unless effective enforcement of relevant legislation is applied. While several information privacy regulators exist, the dominant norm is to respond reactively on reported incidents. Reactive response is useful for cleaning up detected breaches but does not provide a clear indication of the level of personal information available on the internet since only reported incidents are taken into account. The possibility of pro-active automated breach detection has previously been discussed as a capability augmentation for existing privacy regulators. By pro-actively detecting leaked information, detection times can potentially be reduced to limit the exposure time of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) on publicly accessible networks. At present the average time for data breach detection is in excess of three months internationally and breach discovery it most often not by the data owner but an external third party increasing exposure of leaked information. The duration of time that data is exposed on the internet has severe negative implications since a significant portion of information disclosed in data breaches have been proven to be used for cybercrime activities. It could then be argued that any reduction of data breach exposure time should directly reduce the opportunity for associated cyber-crime. While pro-active breach detection has been proven as potentially viable in previous work, numerous aspects of such a system remain in question. Aspects such as legality, detection accuracy and communication with affected parties and alignment with privacy regulator operating procedures are all unexplored. The research presented in this paper considers the results obtained from two iterations of such an experimental system that was conducted on the South African. co.za domain. The first iteration conducted in early 2014 was used as a baseline for the second iteration that was conducted one year later in 2015. While the experiment was conducted on the South African cyber domain, the concepts are applicable to the international environment.
A robust and accurate forecast of the Quality of Service (QoS) attributes is essential for effective web service recommendation, enhanced user experience, and service management. Deep learning methods, especially Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM NN), have proven to be worthy for sequence forecasting in various domains recently. In this paper, we pilot an experimental application of LSTM NN in the domain of QoS forecasting. We develop a LSTM NN model for QoS prediction and compare its forecast performance with existing approaches for QoS attribute forecasting - ARIMA and Holt-Winters models. The approaches are compared on two real-world QoS attribute datasets created using centralized passive QoS attribute collection technique. Our results show that LSTM NN improves the accuracy of QoS forecast for attributes collected with high granularity while maintaining a reasonable computation time.
In 1967, the Supreme Court decided the landmark case of United States v. Katz, which engineered a paradigm shift in Fourth Amendment law: instead of focusing solely on property interests in determining whether or not a search' had occurred, the Court broadened the scope of the Amendment's protection to include any activity in which an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, subsequent decisions by lower courts-as well as recent decisions by the Supreme Court itself-have shown a continuing tension in the Katz legacy. This Article argues that an accurate application of the Katz test considers only the result of the search-the type of information that was acquired-and disregards altogether the method of the search-the action or conduct of the agent conducting the search. Although this is a broader view of the test than some courts have adopted, this view is supported by a close textual reading of Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Katz (which set out the reasonable expectations test) and is also consistent with much of the reasoning in case law from the hundred years prior to Katz. Furthermore, application of a purely results-based test is all the more necessary given the advances in technology that have occurred since that landmark case was decided over thirty years ago. This is especially true in the fields of computer crime, sense-enhancing technology, and binary or content-discriminating searches. Part I of this Article analyzes the reasonable expectation of privacy test set out in the Katz case by briefly tracing the history behind the test and then examining how the Court has applied the test since Katz. Part 11 presents a results-based interpretation of the Katz test and places it in the context of the evolving case law on the subject. Part III examines three specific methods of investigation: computer-assisted investigations (whether of cybercrime or more traditional crimes), sense-enhancing technology, and binary or content-discriminating searches, and demonstrate the ways in which improper applications of the Katz standard have resulted in holdings that are inconsistent with Katz's original purpose-and incompatible with technology in today's world.
Purpose Within a larger mandate of reviewing the key global trends concerning consumer protection in the electronic commerce (e-commerce) literature, this study aims to study the legal framework concerning e-commerce and consumer protection in the Sultanate of Oman and to analyse the current regulations concerning e-commerce and consumer protection. Design/methodology/approach This study followed the normative legal research approach and resorted to the desk research process to facilitate content analysis of literature containing consumer protection legislation and regulatory provisions in Oman in particular and the rest of the world in general. Findings The study reveals that consumer protection initiatives in Oman are well entrenched for offline transactions, but are relatively new and limited for e-commerce. In spite of the promulgation of consumer protection laws, electronic transaction law and cybercrime law, consumer protection measures for e-commerce in Oman do not address a large number of the global concerns necessary to build consumer confidence and trust in the online environment. Research limitations/implications There is a dearth of information concerning Oman on this topic in the extant literature. The research also witnessed the lack of empirical data on the issue of consumer protection and e-commerce in Oman that offer a detailed database of consumer complaints and associated outcomes. Practical implications The mechanism of consumer protection in electronic transactions is not robust in many countries. Because of the lack of comprehensive and robust legislation, consumers remain vulnerable in the online contractual purchase process. Moving beyond the fragmented legislation, many countries are currently mulling an all-comprehensive e-commerce law, implications of this paper will help the policymakers in identifying the focus areas. Social implications Consumer protection is a burning global issue in this era of consumerism. It is important to build consumer trust, transparency and integrity of transactions to reduce the risk and uncertainties of purchase. Originality/value Consumer protection studies conducted in the context of Oman, hitherto, deal more with data protection and dispute resolution mechanisms, and less with legal provisions, regulations and consumer confidence. The study shares newer insights based on a systematic review of legal and business databases. It is the first study of its kind in the context of Oman and the Middle East in general.
Terrorist organisations have already stated to make use of the Internet. Possible activities include cyber-attacks, fundraising, training, recruitment, secret communication, data mining, propaganda and radicalisation. 2 The following article summarises the result of a research undertaken by the author for the Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) and provides an overview about legal response to terrorist use of the Internet.
Through the enhanced connectivity of physical devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) brings improved efficiency to the lives of consumers when on-the-go and in the home. However, it also introduces new potential security threats and risks. These include threats that range from the direct hacking of devices that could undermine the security, privacy and safety of its users, to the enslaving of IoT devices to commit cybercrime at scale, such as Denial of Service attacks. The IoT is recognized as being widely insecure, in large part, due to the lack of security features built into devices. Additionally, consumers do not always actively use security features when available. More disconcerting is that we lack market surveillance on whether manufacturers ship products with good security features or how the importance of user-controlled security features is explained to IoT users. Our study seeks to address this gap. To do this, we compiled a database of 270 consumer IoT devices produced by 220 different manufacturers on sale at the time of the study. The user manuals and associated support pages for these devices were then analysed to provide a 'consumer eye' view of the security features they provide and the cyber hygiene advice that is communicated to users. The security features identified were then mapped to the UK Government's Secure by Design Code of Practice for IoT devices to examine the extent to which devices currently on the market appear to conform to it. Our findings suggest that manufacturers provide too little publicly available information about the security features of their devices, which makes market surveillance challenging and provides consumers with little information about the security of devices prior to their purchase. On average, there was discussion of around four security features, with account management and software updates being the most frequently mentioned. Advice to consumers on cyber hygiene was rarely provided. Finally, we found a lack of standardization in the communication of security-related information for IoT devices among our sample. We argue for government intervention in this space to provide assurances around device security, whether this is provided in a centralized or decentralized manner.
A world association acknowledges that dynamics of the development of the shadow sector becomes a global threat economic security, in this connection with what from the states acceptance of the concerted measures of fight is required against this publicly dangerous phenomenon both on national and on international levels. To deal with these sources, the appropriate mechanisms for regulating the level of development of the shadow economy sector from the state side need to be upgraded. Nevertheless, the development of shadow processes in the economy is due to the fact that their volumes actually do not lead to a clear, systematic control, which leads to the need to improve the priority areas of regulatory control in some kind of cybercrime. Higher education provides an opportunity to consider the investigated issue as an actuality of nautical education, which has important scientific and practical knowledge for introducing changes into the theory and practice of mechanisms of regulatory regulation, namely, the effectiveness of the functioning of state instruments in counteracting the development of shadowing in Ukraine. In the article, the identification of views of both domestic and foreign scientists concerning the content of the contents and the main components of the mechanisms of effective regulation in the field of counteraction to the shadow economy are conducted. It was carried out an analysis of the current level of the shadow sector in Ukraine and identified the basic factors of the domestic economy in the educational stage of the state's development. There are a number of factors that affected the scale of the shadow economy in Ukraine. There was a proposed scientific and methodological approach to the formation of an effective integration mechanism for counteracting the shadow economy in Ukraine. It was the necessity to unify and consolidate formally obligatory inclusion of the coordination and advisory bodies to prevent the shadow of the country members of the public, which in turn will contribute to the balancing of public power and public foundations in the context of establishing state mechanisms of combating the shadow economy. The revision of the conducted report makes it possible to apply the innovative recombination on the effective functioning of the mechanisms of the effective regulation of the opposition to the development of the shadow economy sector.
Purpose Drawing from the argument that mobile money services have a significant potential to provide a wide range of affordable, convenient and secure financial services, there have been rampant frauds on consumers of financial products over the digital financial platform. Thus, this study aims to establish the mediating effect of digital consumer protection in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion with data collected from micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in northern Uganda. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the main objective of this study, a research model was developed to test for the mediating effect of digital consumer protection in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. The data were collected from MSMEs and structural equation modelling in partial least square (PLS) combined with bootstrap was applied to analyze and test the hypotheses of this study. The direct and indirect effect of mobile money adoption and usage on financial inclusion was tested through digital consumer protection as a mediator variable. Findings The findings from the PLS-structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that mobile money adoption and usage has both direct and indirect effect on financial inclusion. Moreover, financial inclusion is influenced by both mobile money adoption and usage and digital consumer protection. Research limitations/implications The study used partial least square (PLS-SEM) combined with bootstrap confidence intervals through a formative approach to establish the mediating effect of the mediator variable. Hence, it ignored the use of covariance-based SEM and the MedGraph programme. Furthermore, data were collected from samples located in Gulu district, northern Uganda and specifically from MSMEs. This limits generalization of the study findings to other population who also use mobile money services. Practical implications Promoters of digital financial services, managers of telecommunication companies, and financial inclusion advocates should consider strengthening the existing digital consumer protection laws on the mobile money platform. A collaborative approach between the mobile network operators, financial institutions and regulators should tighten the existing laws against mobile money fraudsters and an efficient mechanism for recourse, compensation and remedy should be set up to benefit the victims of frauds and cybercrime on the Fintech ecosystem. Originality/value The current study gives a useful insight into the critical mediating role of digital consumer protection as a cushion for promoting financial inclusion through mobile phones over the Fintech that face great threat and risk from cyber insecurity.
"Image forensic analysis becomes a major role in the field of digital image security due to tampering and forgery. The image forgery violates the authenticity and ownership of digital images. Copy-move forgery considers a significant kind of image forensic analysis algorithm. In this kind, the forger copies a part of an original image and then pastes it into the selected position from the same image. The purpose of forgery is to hide or highlight a specific region of the original image. To detect copy-move forgery, there are two traditional techniques: block-based and keypoint-based. The main drawback of the keypoint-based technique is the insufficient features for the small and flat regions, which causes undetected forgery. In contrast, the block-based technique has intensive processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust scheme that overcomes the drawbacks of the above techniques and maintains their advantages. This scheme adopts three connected stages, the first detects the initial duplicated regions using the SURF-HOG detector and descriptor. Subsequently, the second stage localizes the primary matched regions by SLIC segmentation and then selects the suspicious neighbor regions to be combined with primary regions to obtain the active regions. In the third stage, the block-based technique adopts overlapping Zernike moments to extract sufficient key points from the produced active regions. In the final stage, the duplicated regions are classified into authentic or forged regions. The proposed scheme provides not only forgery detection but also localization and recognition for the duplicated regions. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is fast and has high accuracy for forgery detection and localization, at least 93.75, and 7.25 in terms of True Positive and False Positive Rates. Moreover, the scheme has high robustness under various conditions and attacks such as geometric transformation attacks and compound photometric attacks. The proposed scheme can be used in sensitive applications such as cybercrime detection and adopted as evidence in the courts.& COPY; 2022 The Authors.

This article is about the manifestations of similarities between two seemingly distinct groups of Nigerians: cybercriminals and politicians. Which linguistic strategies do Twitter users use to express their opinions on cybercriminals and politicians? The study undertakes a qualitative analysis of 'engaged' tweets of an elite law enforcement agency in West Africa. We analyzed and coded over 100,000 'engaged' tweets based on a component of mechanisms of moral disengagement (i.e., advantageous comparison), a linguistic device. The results reveal how respondents defend the actions of online fraudsters (the deviant group) by strategically comparing them to the wrongful acts of corrupt politicians (the respectable group). Similarly, the results show how respondents positioned this linguistic strategy to compare the powerless group (online fraudsters) and the powerful group (politicians) in society. Indeed, tweet responses suggest that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) generally looks downwards for culprits (i.e., online fraudsters) while ignoring fraudulent politicians. We conclude that the process by which some actions are interpreted as a crime compared to others is a moral enterprise.
We consider the nearest-neighbor search on large-scale high-dimensional datasets that cannot fit in the main memory. Sketches are bit strings that compactly express data points. Although it is usually thought that wide sketches are needed for high-precision searches, we use relatively narrow sketches such as 22-bit or 24-bit, to select a small set of candidates for the search. We use an asymmetric distance between data points and sketches as the criteria for candidate selection, instead of traditionally used Hamming distance. It can be considered a distance partially restoring quantization error. We utilize an efficient one-by-one sketch enumeration in the order of the partially restored distance to realize a fast candidate selection. We use two datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method: YFCC100M-HNfc6 consisting of about 100 million 4,096 dimensional image descriptors and DEEP1B consisting of 1 billion 96 dimensional vectors. Using a standard desktop computer, we conducted a nearest-neighbor search for a query on datasets stored on SSD, where vectors are represented by 8-bit integers. The proposed method executes the search in 5.8 seconds for the 400GB dataset YFCC100M, and 0.24 seconds for the 100GB dataset DEEP1B, while keeping the recall of 90%.
Asset identification plays a vital role in situational awareness building. However, the current trends in communication encryption and the emerging new protocols turn the well-known methods into a decline as they lose the necessary data to work correctly. In this paper, we examine the traffic patterns of the TLS protocol and its changes introduced in version 1.3. We train a machine learning model on TLS handshake parameters to identify the operating system of the client device and compare its results to well-known identification methods. We test the proposed method in a large wireless network. Our results show that precise operating system identification can be achieved in encrypted traffic of mobile devices and notebooks connected to the wireless network.
The development of modem computer technology and changes in federal legislation introduced in recent years, have caused the authors to identify the main trends in the development of criminal liability for crimes against the security of computer information: four areas that encourage the need to increase criminal liability for acts committed with computer technology. The paper also gives a historical overview devoted to the development of computer technologies and a general description of crimes in the field of computer information, taking into account changes introduced into criminal legislation by Federal Law No. 194-FZ dated July 26, 2017.
Network community detection often relies on optimizing partition quality functions, like modularity. This optimization appears to be a complex problem traditionally relying on discrete heuristics. And although the problem could be reformulated as continuous optimization, direct application of the standard optimization methods has limited efficiency in overcoming the numerous local extrema. However, the rise of deep learning and its applications to graphs offers new opportunities. And while graph neural networks have been used for supervised and unsupervised learning on networks, their application to modularity optimization has not been explored yet. This paper proposes a new variant of the recurrent graph neural network algorithm for unsupervised network community detection through modularity optimization. The new algorithm's performance is compared against the state-of-the-art methods. The approach also serves as a proof-of-concept for the broader application of recurrent graph neural networks to unsupervised network optimization.
"Online Identity Theft (ID theft) is a significant problem in our modern knowledge-based and social-driven computing era. This type of cybercrime can be achieved in a number of different ways; and more of the point, various statistical figures suggest it is on the increase. The target is individual privacy and self-assurance, while efforts and measures for increased security and protection appear inadequate to prevent it. While personal identities are increasingly being stored and shared on digital media in virtualised environments, the threat of personal and private information that is used fraudulently cannot be eliminated. This trend in crime can result in complex investigations that involve virtualised information technologies, both as a medium for analysis and as evidence at the same time. Fraudsters are obtaining more sophisticated technological ways and increase their capability not only for committing but also for concealing their crimes. It is believed that fraudsters of this kind of crime are not acting individually, but rather they operate in an organised and well-structured manner. Indeed ID theft is nowadays directly linked to drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism. ID theft, like almost all different types of crime, involves two parts, at least one victim and at least one fraudster. We argue that the differentiation of the investigation procedure between the victim's and the fraudster's side, depends on the ownership and control of the digital media involved in the crime, and can provide results on a more crime-focused basis. In addition it provides information gathering, understanding and knowledge about the way the fraudster acts and could potentially assist in future investigations. Different pieces of evidence can be discovered on each side (victim-fraudster) concerning the techniques that have been used to perpetrate the crime. The online ID theft techniques can leave evidence on both the victim's and the fraudster's system. However, the evidence tends to contain different elements on each side that can reveal information about the fraudster and eventually profile him in relation to the attack. There is an approach of profiling the ID theft fraudster based on the findings thatarise during the forensic investigation process in this paper. We discuss the extent of ID theft as a problem and the role of the fraudster in different ID theft techniques. We aim to demonstrate processes that could assist the profiling of the fraudster under the forensic investigation of ID theft."
In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior. In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.
"Thirty three of the 55 African countries have enacted data privacy laws since 2001. This paper analyses two types of potential legal influences on these national laws: standards and obligations originating from outside Africa (international); and those developed within Africa, both at the continental (African Union) level, and at the level of Regional Economic Communities (RECs).& nbsp;Analysis commences with which countries have laws or Bills, and constitutional require-ments International influences are shown to be indirect, with only slight UN influences, but with accessions by African countries to data protection Convention 108 significant in con-verting it into a global Convention. EU influences are also indirect (aspirational) with both the DPD and the GDPR perceived as standards to be emulated in African instruments. Of African multilateral agreements, the African Union's data protection and cybercrime Con-vention (2014) is yet of limited influence because it is not in force. In contrast, the ECOWAS Supplementary Act (2010) has been of considerable practical influence in West Africa. The HIPPSA `Model Acts' with higher standards (particularly SADC Model Law, 2013) remain of potential influence in other regions of sub-Saharan Africa.& nbsp;European instruments are presented as typifying `three generations' of development of data privacy laws (exemplified by (i) Convention 108, 1980; (ii) EU DPD, 1995; and (iii) EU GDPR, 2016 plus Convention 108 + , 2018). The three main African multilateral instruments (ECOWAS Act, AU Convention, SADC Model Law) are compared with them, as well as be-tween themselves.& nbsp;These comparisons enable conclusions to be drawn, some of which are as follows.& nbsp;The African regional framework does not display any Africa-specific approach to data protection. Less individualist and more communitarian African culture or human rights discourse is absent from the texts of these laws.& nbsp;Drafters of the African instruments seem to accept, tacitly or expressly the necessity to be consistent with other international texts, in particular European instruments. They have adopted many `2nd generation' DPD elements but have anticipated relatively few of the `third generation' GDPR standards.& nbsp;Sub-regional agreements (ECOWAS Act and model laws) have provided a means to move forward despite the lack of progress in bring the regional AU convention into force.

Purpose This study aims to identify weaknesses in current internal control systems in protecting customer data and the drivers that motivate employees to steal customer data and the impact of customer data theft on the organization. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was taken to investigate and analyze internal control system weaknesses. One organization that involved investor and treasury services was selected as a case study in this research. A mixed method of data collection, specifically survey questionnaires and observations, was used. Findings This study revealed that employees are aware of the policy to protect customer data in their organization. Ironically, customer data theft still occurred despite the company having an internal control system. The main concern was the attitude of the employees to adhere to the policies in place, which becomes the major cause of internal control violation. Employees tend to ignore policies and standard operating procedures, providing opportunities for data theft and fraud to occur, although they realize this will result in a severe impact on the reputation of a company. Research limitations/implications - The results provide further confirmation of the fraud triangle theory, i. e. opportunity on the possible causes of the data theft and fraud, supporting prior empirical research and surveys conducted by researchers and global professional firms on fraud. This study, however, was conducted on only one organization with limited participation from employees because of the sensitivity of the nature of the topic. Practical implications - This study provided recommendations that can be a reference for companies and regulatory bodies in preventing customer data theft cases, such as regular training and awareness campaigns to the staff, stringent recruitment policies, close monitoring on the accessibility of customer data and continuous use of advanced technology to prevent a data breach. Originality/value - This study is original, as it focuses on an organization that operates in the financial services industry, which is one of the most attacked sectors for data theft and cybercrime activity globally. Furthermore, this kind of research is rare in fraud literature, particularly in developing markets such as Malaysia. The findings of this study are inferred from the direct observation of the organizational and employee work environments, activities and behaviors, which are private and confidential and difficult to access by researchers for publication in academic journals.
Recent studies have shown that phishers are using phishing kits to deploy phishing attacks faster, easier and more massive. Detecting phishing kits in deployed websites might help to detect phishing campaigns earlier. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets providing a set of phishing kits that are used in websites that were attacked by phishing. In this work, we propose PhiKitA, a novel dataset that contains phishing kits and also phishing websites generated using these kits. We have applied MD5 hashes, fingerprints, and graph representation DOM algorithms to obtain baseline results in PhiKitA in three experiments: familiarity analysis of phishing kit samples, phishing website detection and identifying the source of a phishing website. In the familiarity analysis, we find evidence of different types of phishing kits and a small phishing campaign. In the binary classification problem for phishing detection, the graph representation algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.50%, showing that the phishing kit data contain useful information to classify phishing. Finally, the MD5 hash representation obtained a 39.54% F1 score, which means that this algorithm does not extract enough information to distinguish phishing websites and their phishing kit sources properly.
Internet of Things (IoT) devices are constantly growing in numbers, forecasted to reach 27 billion in 2025. With such a large number of connected devices, energy consumption concerns are a major priority for the upcoming years. Cloud / Edge / Fog Computing are critically associated with IoT devices as enablers for data communication and coordination among devices. In this paper, we look at the distribution of Semantic Reasoning between IoT devices and define a new class of reasoning, multi-step reasoning, that can be associated at the level of the edge or fog node in the context of IoT devices. We conduct an experiment based on synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance of multi-step reasoning in terms of power consumption, memory, and CPU usage. Overall we found that multi-step reasoning can help in reducing computation time and energy consumption on IoT devices in the presence of larger datasets.
With the rapid advancements in digital technologies and the exponential growth of digital artifacts, automated filtering of cybercrime data for digital investigation from a variety of resources has become the need of the hour. Many techniques primarily based on the Approximate Matching  approach have been proposed in the literature to address this challenging task. In the year 2019, Chang et al. proposed one such algorithm -FbHash: A New Similarity Hashing Scheme for Digital Forensics that was shown to produce the best correlation results compared to other existing techniques and also resist active adversary attack, unlike others. However, no performance analysis of the tool was given. In this work, we show that the current design structure of FbHash is slower and memory intensive compared to its peers. We then propose a novel Bloom filter based efficient version, i.e., FbHash-E that has a much lower memory footprint and is computationally faster compared to FbHash. While the speed of FbHash-E is comparable to other state-of-the-art tools, it is resistant (like its predecessor) to inten-tional/intelligent modifications that can fool the tool  attacks, unlike its peers. Our version thus renders FbHash-E fit for practical use-cases. We perform various modification tests to evaluate the security and correctness of FbHash-E. Our experiment results show that our scheme is secure against active attacks and detects similarity with 87% accuracy. Compared to FbHash, there is only 3% drop in accuracy results. We demonstrate the sensitivity and robustness of our proposed scheme by performing a variety of containment and resemblance tests. We show that FbHash-E can correlate files with up to 10% random-noise with 100% detection rate and is able to detect commonality as small as 1% between the two documents with an appropriate similarity score. We also show that our proposed scheme performs best to identify similarities between different versions of software or program files. We also introduce a new test, i.e., consistency test, and exhibit that our tool produces consistent results across all files under a fixed category with very low standard deviation, unlike other tools where standard deviation under a fixed test varies significantly. This shows that our tool is more robust and stable against different modifications. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Cybersecurity and digital forensics are closely related to current and even more to future criminal proceedings due to the fact that digital evidence is more and more dominating the body of evidence in criminal trials. It is also fair to say that digital forensics to a large extent performs in cybersecurity as a production of digital evidence. Not only in cybercrime but also in ordinary crimes like car theft, drug related crimes and forms of traditional organized crimes judicial decision-making and reasoning at trials and finally in judgments are more and more based on references to digital traces and data which are provided by forensic IT experts as exhibits. At the first glance providing digital data as evidence to criminal courts appears to be a straightforward more technical process. This paper claims that turning digital traces into digital evidence is anything but a simple and linear technical process just having to respect state-of-the-art technical standards and following rules for the chain of custody. Instead it will demonstrate that digital forensics is one part in a more complex social construction process where standards and methods of IT forensics of the 21st century meet evidentiary procedural rules in criminal justice of the 19th century, hence applied by a judiciary of the 20th century. This state of asynchrony leads to basic conflicts between digital forensics on the one side, rule of law, to process and fair trial on the other. The paper will reflect upon the central question if and how this conflict between digital forensics and traditional due process in the transition from analog to digital evidence in criminal justice proceedings can be turned into an integrated and complementary approach for the final sake of justice and security in the society. While the current situation is leading to a gap between data and judicial decision (digital divide), new standards for producing procedural truth in a comprehensible data-to-decision-cycle covering both the forensic acquisition, preparation and analysis at the pretrial stage, as well as presenting, testing (verifying/falsifying) and interpreting digital evidence at trial by judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys. Only if both sides, the forensic and judicial, are in balance the digital divide in today's criminal justice practice will fade away.
"E-banking, also known as electronic or Internet banking, has become a prevalent mode for online and internet-based transactions. However, modern databases, online information and knowledge sharing, and increased access points for e-banking transactions opened opportunities for sophisticated fraudsters to perpetrate and abuse customers in their social, cyber and physical worlds. The intensification in cases of fraud presents tremendous challenges for the banking sector to caution, educate and inform customers on cybercrime because it reflects the synthetic and integrative use of the interaction between resources which include the fraudster's intelligence abuse in the social world, the abuse of knowledge resources and technology in the cyber world and the abuse of resources and trading tools in the physical world. Most studies focus on the detection of fraud patterns through tapping in data warehouses of third-party or by using data mining programs to identify fraud patterns, specifically credit cards, computer intrusion and mobile communication or first-party fraud when a legitimate customer knowingly betrays the bank. This study focuses on the prevention of fraud that falls into two main categories, namely: phishing/vishing/SMishing and malware practices (any activity of payment fraud where fraudsters gain access and uses customer' accounts for their own unlawful financial benefit); and identity theft (gaining access to or opening new accounts in the customer's name). The main premises of the research problem are built on the fact that a lack of studies exists to investigate the use of proactive communication through the three typologies of knowledge management to create awareness and educate customers on e-security measures and prevention of e-banking fraud where the move towards (co)liability should not impede but enhance customer relationship building. The research is conducted through a qualitative research methodology and the subject under study was the website of the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) purposefully sampled. The three concurrent cyclical flow of activity of the data analysis interactive model was used in the research. An abductive approach was used to report on the findings based on descriptions and interpretive comments relating it to and drawing on the theoretical thrusts identified. Main findings suggest, inter alia, the importance to proactively educate customers on how to protect themselves before they fall, victim, the importance of visibility on security measures, methods and standards for e-banking, and the move towards a (co)liability policy and shared responsibility process."
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how global regulation of cryptocurrencies and other cybercurrencies can assist in addressing the challenges of attribution when investigating ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime using these payment methods. Design/methodology/approach A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months.
For every finitary monad T on sets and every endofunctor F on the category of T-algebras, we introduce the concept of an ffg-Elgot algebra for F, i.e. an algebra admitting coherent solutions for finite systems of recursive equations with effects represented by the monad T. The goal is to study the existence and construction of free ffg-Elgot algebras. To this end, we investigate the locally ffg fixed point phi(F), i.e. the colimit of all F-coalgebras with free finitely generated carrier, which is shown to be the initial ffg-Elgot algebra. This is the technical foundation for our main result: the category of ffg-Elgot algebras is monadic over the category of T-algebras.
"This work is a companion reproducible paper of a previous paper (Antol et al., 2021) in which we presented an alternative to the traditional paradigm of similarity searching in metric spaces called the Learned Metric Index. Inspired by the advance in learned indexing of structured data, we used machine learning models to replace index pivots, thus posing similarity search as a classification problem. This implementation proved to be more than competitive with the conventional methods in terms of speed and recall, proving the concept as viable. The aim of this publication is to make our source code, datasets, and experiments publicly available. For this purpose, we create a collection of Python3 software libraries, YAML reproducible experiment files, and JSON ground-truth files, all bundled in a Docker image - the Learned Metric Index Framework (LMIF) - which can be run using any Docker-compatible operating system on a CPU with Advanced vector extensions (AVX). We introduce a reproducibility protocol for our experiments using LMIF and provide a closer look at the experimental process. We introduce new experimental results by running the reproducibility protocol introduced herein and discussing the differences with the results reported in our primary work (Antol et al., 2021). Finally, we make an argument that these results can be considered weakly reproducible (in both of the performance metrics), since they point to the same conclusions derived in the primary paper.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses the increasing significance of smart water management, within the context of the fourth industrial revolution and the associated cybersecurity risks, particularly in Hungary and Central Europe. By examining the current state of smart water management and analyzing the various cybersecurity threats, this study seeks to raise awareness around the need for enhanced security measures, in this critical sector. The research methodology is primarily based on a through literature review and secondarily, on related data analysis. The paper identifies several cybersecurity challenges and potential solutions for smart water management and finally suggests future research directions, to ensure the safe and sustainable development of this critical infrastructure.
Formation of digital ecosystems enables a multitude of actors like organisations, users and developers to achieve different goals in cooperations. The achievement of operational, tactical and strategic goals of involved actors relies on trustworthy cooperation of systems that operate in open environments and might meet for the first time at runtime. Thus the evaluation of a potential collaborator's trustworthiness also needs to be performed at runtime. In this paper, we enhance our work on trust prediction in digital ecosystems, based on digital twins evaluation, with a supporting reference architecture that enables the creation of such a digital twin for automatic computation of trust.
Emerging evidence shows that safety-critical systems are evolving towards operating in uncertain context while integrating intelligent software that evolves over time as well. Such behavior is considered to be unknown at every moment in time because when faced with a similar situation, these systems are expected to display an improved behavior based on artificial learning. Yet, a correct learning and knowledge-building process for the non-deterministic nature of an intelligent evolution is still not guaranteed and consequently safety of these systems cannot be assured. In this context, the approach of predictive simulation enables runtime predictive evaluation of a system behavior and provision of quantified evidence of trust that enables a system to react safety in case malicious deviations, in a timely manner. For enabling the evaluation of timing behavior in a predictive simulation setting, in this paper we introduce a general timing model that enables the virtual execution of a system's timing behavior. The predictive evaluation of the timing behavior can be used to evaluate a system's synchronization capabilities and in case of delays, trigger a safe fail-over behavior. We iterate our concept over an use case from the automotive domain by considering two safety critical situations.
Cross-border data flows not only involve cross- border trade issues, but also severely challenge personal information protection, national data security, and the jurisdiction of justice and enforcement. As the current digital trade negotiations could not accommodate these challenges, China has initiated the concept of secure cross-border data flow and has launched a dual-track multi-level regulatory system, including control system for overseas transfer of important data, system of crossborder provision of personal information, and system of cross-border data request for justice and enforcement. To explore a global regulatory framework for cross-border data flows, legitimate and controllable cross-border data flows should be promoted, supervision should be categorized based on risk concerned, and the rule of law should be coordinated at home and abroad to promote system compatibility. To this end, the key is to build a compatible regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the scope of important data to define the Negative List for preventing national security risks, improving the cross-border accountability for protecting personal information rights and interests to ease pre-supervision pressure, and focusing on data access rights instead of data localization for upholding the jurisdiction of justice and enforcement.
Camera model identification is a standard task in digital image forensics. Learning-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance, but they are sensitive to so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) data due to a mismatch between the training and testing distribution. This may result in a significant reduction in classifier performance that is, unfortunately, not easy to anticipate for a forensic analyst. In this work, we investigate possibilities for adding reliability measures to the task of camera model identification. We leverage learning architectures that include an uncertainty measure with every prediction that can be reported back to an analyst. To this end, we investigate deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). We compare both methods against a standard CNN with softmax statistics as uncertainty metric. We demonstrate in several experiments that both probabilistic approaches provide simultaneously state-of-the-art classification performance and reliable uncertainty estimates on OOD data. The uncertainty of deep ensembles is more accurate on OOD camera models, while BNN uncertainties are more accurate on OOD post-processing.
"This paper presents DIALOG ( Digital Investigation Ontology); a framework for the management, reuse, and analysis of Digital Investigation knowledge. DIALOG provides a general, application independent vocabulary that can be used to describe an investigation at different levels of detail. DIALOG is defined to encapsulate all concepts of the digital forensics field and the relationships between them. In particular, we concentrate on the Windows Registry, where registry keys are modeled in terms of both their structure and function. Registry analysis software tools are modeled in a similar manner and we illustrate how the interpretation of their results can be done using the reasoning capabilities of ontology.

"Importance Anecdotal evidence suggests that health care delivery organizations face a growing threat from ransomware attacks that are designed to disrupt care delivery and may consequently threaten patient outcomes. Objective To quantify the frequency and characteristics of ransomware attacks on health care delivery organizations. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used data from the Tracking Healthcare Ransomware Events and Traits database to examine the number and characteristics of ransomware attacks on health care delivery organizations from 2016 to 2021. Logistic and negative binomial regression quantified changes over time in the characteristics of ransomware attacks that affected health care delivery organizations. Main Outcomes and Measures Date of ransomware attack, public reporting of ransomware attacks, personal health information (PHI) exposure, status of encrypted/stolen data following the attack, type of health care delivery organization affected, and operational disruption during the ransomware attack. Results From January 2016 to December 2021, 374 ransomware attacks on US health care delivery organizations exposed the PHI of nearly 42 million patients. From 2016 to 2021, the annual number of ransomware attacks more than doubled from 43 to 91. Almost half (166 [44.4%]) of ransomware attacks disrupted the delivery of health care, with common disruptions including electronic system downtime (156 [41.7%]), cancellations of scheduled care (38 [10.2%]), and ambulance diversion (16 [4.3%]). From 2016 to 2021, ransomware attacks on health care delivery organizations increasingly affected large organizations with multiple facilities (annual marginal effect [ME], 0.08; 95% CI, 0.05-0.10; P<.001), exposed the PHI of more patients (ME, 66385.8; 95% CI, 3400.5-129371.2; P=.04), were less likely to be restored from data backups (ME, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.01; P=.002), were more likely to exceed mandatory reporting timelines (ME, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P<.001), and increasingly were associated with delays or cancellations of scheduled care (ME, 0.02; 95% CI, 0-0.05; P=.02). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study of ransomware attacks documented growth in their frequency and sophistication. Ransomware attacks disrupt care delivery and jeopardize information integrity. Current monitoring/reporting efforts provide limited information and could be expanded to potentially yield a more complete view of how this growing form of cybercrime affects the delivery of health care. This cohort study examines the frequency and characteristics of ransomware attacks on health care delivery organizations."
Online child sexual abuse is a relatively new form of crime against children which requires a more concerted action on a global scale. Intricate organizational, technical, legal and socio-psychological issues surrounding this phenomenon make the current structure and possible solutions to organizational problems extremely complicated to analyse, evaluate and discuss. This commentary focuses on the organizational aspect by dividing the complex global response into four simple layers: governments and inter-governmental agencies, police and judicial bodies, non-governmental organizations and the private sector. Undoubtedly, developing more effective global policies for the fight against online child sexual abuse relies on deeper understanding of the current structure and the roles of each layer.
Timed automata (TA) have been widely adopted as a suitable formalism to model time-critical systems. Furthermore, contemporary model-checking tools allow the designer to check whether a TA complies with a system specification. However, the exact timing constants are often uncertain during the design phase. Consequently, the designer is often able to build a TA with a correct structure, however, the timing constants need to be tuned to satisfy the specification. Moreover, even if the TA initially satisfies the specification, it can be the case that just a slight perturbation during the implementation causes a violation of the specification. Unfortunately, model-checking tools are usually not able to provide any reasonable guidance on how to fix the model in such situations. In this paper, we propose several concepts and techniques to cope with the above mentioned design phase issues when dealing with reachability and safety specifications.
Profinite equations are an indispensable tool for the algebraic classification of formal languages. Reiterman's theorem states that they precisely specify pseudovarieties, i.e., classes of finite algebras closed under finite products, subalgebras and quotients. In this article, Reiterman's theorem is generalized to finite EilenbergMoore algebras for a monad T on a category D: we prove that a class of finite T-algebras is a pseudovariety iff it is presentable by profinite equations. As a key technical tool, we introduce the concept of a profinite monad (T) over cap associated to the monad T, which gives a categorical view of the construction of the space of profinite terms.
Sketches are compact bit strings that are considered as products of an LSH for high-dimensional data. We use them in filtering for narrowing down solution candidates in similarity search. We propose a pivot selection method for narrow sketches with a length such as 16-bits by optimization algorithms with the accuracy of filtering itself as the objective function.
This Full Paper in the Research-To-Practice Category presents a long-term study about the effects of a student-centered course on communication and professional skills on students' thoughts, attitudes, and behavior. The course is offered at a European university as part of a computer science master's program. This paper shares the design and challenges of a longitudinal study that reaches ten years behind and employs a mixed-methods approach. Besides presenting and interpreting the findings, we shed light on which features tend to stay on students' minds and impact their way of being and acting in society. Moreover, we suggest implications for the design and practice in comparable courses to maximize constructive, sustainable effects, such as improved active listening, presentation skills, and openness to other perspectives. These are essential (not only) for computer science professionals. Our findings suggest that the course provided significant learning for the vast majority of respondents, including aspects such as presenting while keeping the other side in mind, managing one's stress, and becoming less shy to speak up. All in all, we aim to contribute an evidence-based source of motivation for instructors in technically focused curricula who hold a student-centered stance.
The vast variety of information on web forums makes them a valuable resource for various purposes such as scam detection, national security protection and sentiment analysis. However, it is challenging to extract useful information from web forums accurately and efficiently. First, several page types exist in web forums and content is presented in different formats in these pages. Second, the content on the forum pages is stored in the form of data blocks. For the information to be meaningful, it is necessary to extract the relevant data blocks separately. The main problem with generic content extraction systems is that they cannot distinguish among various pages nor extract information with the required granularity. Although, several content extraction methods exist for web forums, these methods either do not satisfy the above requirements or use heuristics based approaches (such as assumptions on standard visual appearances, etc., resulting in limited applicability to different varieties of forum). In this paper, we propose a general and efficient content extraction method using the properties of links present in forum pages. The effectiveness of our proposed method is shown through our experimental results.
Purpose - Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a transnational organized crime that generates billions in criminal proceeds each year. Yet, it is not regarded by many countries as a serious crime. There is also no general consensus on its recognition as a predicate offence for money laundering. In this regard, banks are misused in different ways to facilitate financial flows linked to IWT. This paper aims to illustrate the importance of the banking sector in combating money laundering relating to IWT. It also aims to demonstrate the need for a general recognition of IWT as a predicate offence for money laundering. Design/methodology/approach - This study investigates the implementation of money laundering controls by banks in the illegal-wildlife-trade context. As background to this investigation, it provides an overview of IWT, which is followed by an exploration of some of the general characteristics of the banking sector, before discussing the relevant Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. Findings - This study finds that the banking sector is well-placed to combat money laundering relating to the IWT and is, by virtue of its international nature and strong focus on compliance, able to be effective in preventing the use of the proceeds of IWT as well as in identifying broader trafficking networks. Moreover, the banking sector is well-equipped to develop appropriate platforms to facilitate the swift, easy and effective sharing of financial intelligence between banks at the local, regional and especially international level. Research limitations/implications - This study draws on publicly available information on financial flows relating to IWT. Little data and research are available on the financial flows and consequently the money laundering techniques used in cases suspected of IWT. Originality/value - There has been little scholarly research on the relationship between money laundering and the IWT as well as the financial flows of IWT in general. This study highlights some of the money laundering techniques used in relation to IWT by drawing on the works of various international organizations, including the FATF.
"A literature survey shows that the number of malware attacks is gradually growing over the years due to the growing trend of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. To detect and classify malware attacks, automated malware detection and classification is an essential subsystem in healthcare cyber-physical systems. This work proposes an attention-based multidimensional deep learning (DL) approach for a cross-architecture IoMT malware detection and classification system based on byte sequences extracted from Executable and Linkable Format (ELF; formerly named Extensible Linking Format) files. The DL approach automates the feature design and extraction process from unstructured byte sequences. In addition, the proposed approach facilitates the detection of the central processing unit (CPU) architecture of the ELF file. A detailed experimental analysis and its evaluation are shown on the IoMT cross-architecture benchmark dataset. In all the experiments, the proposed method showed better performance compared with those obtained from several existing methods with an accuracy of 95% for IoMT malware detection, 94% for IoMT malware classification, and 95% for CPU architectures classification. The proposed method also suggests a similar performance with an accuracy of 94% on the Microsoft malware dataset. Experimental results on two malware datasets indicate that the proposed method is robust and generalizable in cross-architecture IoMT malware detection, classification, and CPU architectures classification in healthcare cyber-physical systems."
Malware detectors based on machine learning (ML) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial malware examples. However, current methods to generate adversarial malware examples still have their limits. They either rely on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks), or on detailed outputs of the model - such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in real-world scenarios. Alternatively, adversarial examples might be crafted using only the label assigned by the detector (label-based attack) to train a substitute network or an agent using reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, label-based attacks might require querying a black-box system from a small number to thousands of times, depending on the approach, which might not be feasible against malware detectors. This work presents a novel query-free approach to craft adversarial malware examples to evade ML-based malware detectors. To this end, we have devised a GAN-based framework to generate adversarial malware examples that look similar to benign executables in the feature space. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have applied the GAN-based attack to three common types of features usually employed by static ML-based malware detectors: (1) Byte histogram features, (2) API-based features, and (3) String-based features. Results show that our model-agnostic approach performs on par with MalGAN, while generating more realistic adversarial malware examples without requiring any query to the malware detectors. Furthermore, we have tested the generated adversarial examples against state-of-the-art multimodal and deep learning malware detectors, showing a decrease in detection performance, as well as a decrease in the average number of detections by the antimalware engines in VirusTotal.
Built into Microsoft Windows is the ability for the operating system to track user window viewing preferences specific to Windows Explorer. This information, which is called ShellBag'' information, is stored in several locations within the Windows Registry in the Windows Operating System. This paper introduces a novel method to examine ShellBag information within Registry snapshots to reconstruct user activities. It compares different states of ShellBag information within consecutive Registry snapshots in order to detect ShellBag-related user actions. Nine detection rules are proposed on the basis of analyzing the causality between user actions and updated ShellBag information. This approach can be used to prove that certain interactions between the user and system must have, or must not have happened during a certain time period.

The dataset contains intrusion detection alerts obtained via an alert sharing platform (SABU) for one week. A plethora of heterogeneous intrusion detection systems deployed across several organizations contributed to the sharing platform. The alerts are stored in the intrusion Detection Extensible Alert (IDEA) format and categorized using the eCSIRT.net Incident Taxonomy. Dataset can be used in several areas of cybersecurity research for the analysis of intrusion detection alerts including temporal and spatial correlations, reputation scoring, attack scenario reconstruction, and attack projection. The network identifiers (e.g., IP addresses, hostnames) are anonymized. However, the list of interesting features (e.g., presence on blacklists, geolocation) of such entities at the time of data collection is provided. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
Against the tide of a huge amount of data, law enforcement agencies barely manage to focus on undiscovered child abuse materials (CAMs) to identify victims, abusers, and crime scenes. Currently, to alleviate this burden to some extent, there are international and national repositories of CAMs in place, such as Interpol's International Child Sexual Exploitation Database (ICSE DB), NCMEC's Child Recognition and Identification System (CRIS), and the UK's Child Abuse Image Database (CAID). This article introduced these global, regional, and national repositories and other related transnational initiatives comprehensively and also critiques the current trend of setting up more repositories and additional initiatives at local and regional levels. Later, the author elaborates on a plan for a single global repository governed by an international organization. Despite a significant decrease in the costs for a country to be actively involved in the fight against online child sexual abuse and emergence of new possibilities for more effective prevention strategies and investigational methods, such an idea of global centralization might face insurmountable opposition from current stakeholders, particularly because of organizational concerns and technological challenges.
"Recent progress in pose-estimation methods enables the extraction of sufficiently-precise 3D human skeleton data from ordinary videos, which offers great opportunities for a wide range of applications. However, such spatio-temporal data are typically extracted in the form of a continuous skeleton sequence without any information about semantic segmentation or annotation. To make the extracted data reusable for further processing, there is a need to access them based on their content. In this paper, we introduce a universal retrieval approach that compares any two skeleton sequences based on temporal order and similarities of their underlying segments. The similarity of segments is determined by their content-preserving low-dimensional code representation that is learned using the Variational AutoEncoder principle in an unsupervised way. The quality of the proposed representation is validated in retrieval and classification scenarios; our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in effectiveness and reaches speed-ups up to 64x on common skeleton sequence datasets."
The emergence of the internet as a global, borderless communication platform afforded a wide range of social and economic opportunities to people throughout the world. Criminals have exploited the ability to communicate instantaneously around the globe to facilitate crossjurisdictional cyber-fraud and subsequently, online money laundering. Coordinating international fraud and money laundering schemes requires a medium of communication, such as online hacking and carding forums, where offenders meet to exchange information and to engage in their illegal business. For the study presented in this paper, publicly available online carding and hacking forums were downloaded and keywords of interest pertaining to online money laundering were extracted. This study undertakes an analysis of two large Russian-speaking hacking and carding forums by qualitatively analyzing and quantifying contexts of keyword usage. Findings indicate that cyber-fraudsters are primarily interested in cashing out digitally stolen funds and do so mainly by resorting to the services of money mules and virtual casinos.
Generating automated cyber resilience policies for real-world settings is a challenging research problem that must account for uncertainties in system state over time and dynamics between attackers and defenders. In addition to understanding attacker and defender motives and tools, and identifying relevant system and attack data, it is also critical to develop rigorous mathematical formulations representing the defender's decision-support problem under uncertainty. Game-theoretic approaches involving cyber resource allocation optimization with Markov decision processes (MDP) have been previously proposed in the literature. However, as is the case in strategic card games such as poker, research challenges using game-theoretic approaches for practical cyber defense applications include equilibrium solvability, existence, and possible multiplicity. Moreover, mixed uncertainties associated with player payoffs also need to be accounted for within game settings. This paper proposes an agent-centric approach for cybersecurity decision-support with partial system state observability. Multiple partially observable MDP (POMDP) problems are formulated and solved from a cyber defender's perspective, against a fixed attacker type, using synthetic (notional) system and attack parameters estimated from a Monte Carlo based sampling scheme. The agent-centric problem formulation helps address equilibrium related research challenges and represents a step toward automated and dynamic cyber resilience policy generation and implementation.
"Security by design is an up and coming paradigm which seeks to decrease the opportunity for corruption and disruption, and to increase the inherent stability, dependability and resilience of systems. Cyber experts need to be involved in the design phase as Finagle's Law, interpreted for cybersecurity, is 'if it can be hacked, it will - at the worst possible time'. Testing is designed to counter Murphy's Law and reduce resistentialism. Defensive programming, original cybersecurity, carries an overhead, for which there is often no demonstrable return. The priority of the design stage cybersecurity expert is to plan for contingencies and think like a hacker. It is about risk management; understanding this dictates security by design requirements in the knowledge that interconnected systems' security is only as strong as its weakest link. Definition and audit of Service Level Agreements (SLA) are an essential part of cybersecurity, as is the audit of any third party suppliers of componentry of the system under design. Governance and policy definitions, exciting for some, are integral to cybersecurity. Beyond this, the cybersecurity expert must consider system failure. Recent ransomware attacks have demonstrated the necessity for business continuity plans as recovery has still taken time. The Blue Team Field Manual has an impressive list of necessary documentation and actions required in this event, but glosses over the effort required. While the above is rolling maintenance, threat hunting differs. Every vulnerability or threat must be evaluated for consequential impact. Either a passionate interest in psychology or an extremely jaundiced view of the world is a necessary attribute for cybersecurity. Reality is so different from the aspirations of potential pen testers, incident responders, and AI security engineers facing 3 - 5 post-graduation years to proficiency, it is no wonder disillusion results in a shortage of 3.5 million cybersecurity experts."
Motion capture data digitally represent human movements by sequences of 3D skeleton configurations. Such spatio-temporal data, often recorded in the stream-based nature, need to be efficiently processed to detect high-interest actions, for example, in human-computer interaction to understand hand gestures in real time. Alternatively, automatically annotated parts of a continuous stream can be persistently stored to become searchable, and thus reusable for future retrieval or pattern mining. In this paper, we focus on multi-label detection of user-specified actions in unsegmented sequences as well as continuous streams. In particular, we utilize the current advances in recurrent neural networks and adopt a unidirectional LSTM model to effectively encode the skeleton frames within the hidden network states. The model learns what subsequences of encoded frames belong to the specified action classes within the training phase. The learned representations of classes are then employed within the annotation phase to infer the probability that an incoming skeleton frame belongs to a given action class. The computed probabilities are finally compared against a learned threshold to automatically determine the beginnings and endings of actions. To further enhance the annotation accuracy, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to estimate class probabilities by considering not only the past frames but also the future ones. We extensively evaluate both the models on the three use cases of real-time stream annotation, offline annotation of long sequences, and early action detection and prediction. The experiments demonstrate that our models outperform the state of the art in effectiveness and are at least one order of magnitude more efficient, being able to annotate 10 k frames per second.
This paper describes a methodology for the reconstruction of digital events by comparing states captured in time. Microsoft Windows Restore Point data is used to illustrate how to organize captured state information into a useful timeline of user and system events. It is shown that by comparing consecutive states, events can be uncovered that would otherwise be unknown by analysis of the current system state alone. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
SPRING is a family of pseudo-random functions that aims to combine the guarantees of security reductions with good performance on a variety of platforms. Preliminary software implementations for small-parameter instantiations of SPRING were proposed at FSE 2014, and have been demonstrated to reach throughputs within small factors of those of AES. In this paper, we complement these results and investigate the hardware design space of these types of primitives. Our first (pragmatic) contribution is the first FPGA implementation of SPRING in a counter-like mode. We show that the rounded product operations in our design can be computed efficiently, reaching throughputs in the hundreds of megabits/second range within only 4% of the resources of a modern (Xilinx Virtex-6) reconfigurable device. Our second (more prospective) contribution is to discuss the properties of SPRING hardware implementations for side-channel resistance. We show that a part of the design can be very efficiently masked (with linear overhead), while another part implies quadratic overhead due to non-linear operations (similarly to what is usually observed, e. g., for block ciphers). Yet, we argue that for this second part of the design, resistance against simple power analysis may be sufficient to obtain concrete implementation security. We suggest ways to reach this goal very efficiently, via shuffling. We believe that such hybrid implementations, where each part of the design is protected with adequate solutions, is a promising topic for further investigation.
EU and cyber security Securing network and information systems in the EU is essential to ensure prosperity and to keep the online economy running. The European Union works on a number of fronts to ensure cybersecurity in Europe, from providing the delivery of better internet for kids to implementing the international cooperation on cybersecurity and cybercrime. As societies, governments and businesses become increasingly reliant on the Internet for the normal functioning of every-day activities and the supply of essential services, protecting cyberspace from malicious activities has become a critical action point for policymakers globally. While digital and networked technologies promise much, the implications of successful attacks can be huge. The continued rapid development of information and communication technologies, globalization, the drastic increase in data volumes and the growing number of different types of equipment connected to data networks have an impact on daily life, the economy and the functioning of the state. On the one hand, this level of ICT development will contribute to the improved availability and usability of services, enhance transparency and citizen participation in governance, and cut public as well as private sector costs. On the other hand, the increasing importance of technology is accompanied by an increase in the state's growing dependence on already entrenched e-solutions, and cements the expectation of technology operating eamlessly. Social processes are also becoming increasingly dependent on a growing number of information technology resources, and in the future attention must be drawn to the fact that society at large, and each individual in particular, will be able to maintain control over the corresponding processes. Otherwise, there is potential for information technologies to reduce the role of humans in the decision making process, and processes may become self-regulatory (technological singularity). The number of state actors in cyberspace that are involved in cyber espionage targeted at computers connected to the Internet as well as closed networks continues to grow, with their aim being to collect information on both national security as well as economic interests. The amount and activeness of states capable of cyber-attacks are increasing. In addition to the activation of state actors, the ability of politically motivated individuals and groups with limited means to organize their activities using social networks and carry out denial of service and other types of attacks is growing as well. Meaningful and effective cooperation between the public and private sector in the development of cyber security organization as well as in preventing and resolving cyber incidents is becoming increasingly unavoidable. National defense and internal security are dependent on the private sector's infrastructure and resources, while at the same time the state can assist vital service providers and guarantors of national critical information infrastructure as a coordinator and balancer of various interests.
"Malicious networks of botnets continue to grow in strength as millions of new users and devices connect to the internet each day, many becoming unsuspectingly complicit in cyber-attacks or unwitting accomplices to cybercrimes. Both states and nonstate actors use botnets to surreptitiously control the combined computing power of infected devices to engage in espionage, hacking, and to carry out distributed denial of service attacks to disable internet-connected targets from businesses and banks to power grids and electronic voting systems. Although cybersecurity professionals have established a variety of best practices to fight botnets, many important questions remain concerning why levels of botnet infections differ sharply from country to country, as relatively little empirical testing has been done to establish which policies and approaches to cybersecurity are actually the most effective. Using newly available time-series data on botnets, this article outlines and tests the conventionally held beliefs and cybersecurity strategies at every level-individual, technical, isolationist, and multilateral. This study finds that wealthier countries are more vulnerable than less wealthy countries; that technical solutions, including patching software, preventing spoofing, and securing servers, consistently outperform attempts to educate citizens about cybersecurity; and that countries which favor digital isolation and restrictions on internet freedom are not actually better protected than those who embrace digital freedom and multilateral approaches to cybersecurity. This latter finding is of particular importance as China's attempts to fundamentally reshape the internet via the Digital Silk Road component of the Belt and Road Initiative will actually end up making both China and the world less secure. Due to the interconnected nature of threats in cyberspace, states should instead embrace multilateral, technical solutions to better govern this global common and increase cybersecurity around the world."
The goal of this paper was to analyze hacker forums to better understand the threats they pose to Canadian critical systems specifically and cyber-security more generally. To facilitate the data collection, a customized web-crawler was developed to specifically capture the structured content posted to forums. Three hacker forums were selected for analysis that represented different facets of the hacker community: carding (data theft), coding (malware development and deployment), and security (distribution of vulnerabilities). We identified and geolocated user disclosed IP addresses to try to identify critical systems and determine the extent as well as context in which critical systems were openly discussed by forum users. In total, 311,501 analyzable IP addresses were extracted from the data with 3,168 (1%) geolocated to Canada. The prevalence of Canadian IP addresses does not indicate their potential for exploitation, although it does highlight a perceived heightened interest in Canadian critical systems by hacker forum users. Potential at-risk systems included government agencies, universities across Canada, and private industries within the transportation network, namely aviation and shipping firms.
The increasing ubiquitous use of ICT has changed the way the society operates. When used effectively, ICT has provided people not only with access to information but also opportunities to participate in the global economy. Unfortunately, the widespread use of ICT presents a wide range of social and ethical issues from online safety to security and misuse of information. It is important that users are equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills to operate their devices securely. Therefore, countries should address the issue of Information Security to minimize the risk and bring it to an acceptable level whilst still exploiting the opportunities offered by ICT. An in-depth analysis has shown that effective implementation of information security and especially education is not adhering to paper based requests from government policies and strategies. The lack of cyber laws/regulations, shortage of ICT security skills and poorly secured networks are just some of the challenges affecting policy development and implementation. There is an urgent need for action within all key stakeholders to promote responsible and safe use of ICT. The issue of how to secure cyberspace is important to all nations including developing and least developed countries because cyber insecurity has international ramifications. An attack on one vector could affect the rest of cyberspace. The fact that criminals can commit crime anonymously with minimum effort, and minimum risk of being caught makes cybercrime the favourable tool for many criminals and also a great concern to all. North-South collaboration and support is needed in promoting cyber-security and especially maintaining the concept of solidarity in information security education. Failure to act now means, we are allowing the cyber criminals to take over our networks for their use. The current situations in cyber-security in Kenya, Rwanda and Nepal are presented and models of clever low cost implementation for awareness and educational are shared. The term cyber-wellness (in regard to legislation/regulations, national curriculum, and other educational initiatives) is defined and analysed in the three countries. Furthermore, cyber-wellness is compared with advanced countries to identify the gaps. Literature analysis, questionnaire field research and workshop discussions have identified relevant gaps, but also hope for effective implementation models on strong education and solidarity to assist the policy makers and other stakeholders in development and integration of ICT security in education curriculum at all stages. This paper discusses current ICT security policy implementation issues in education and how this can be improved by sharing knowledge and successful implementation models. The research and development is made in the frame of the Information Security Education and Solidarity Initiative (ISES), a project sponsored by UNESCO Participation Programme submitted through Technical Committee No. 3 Education of the International Federation on Information Processing (IFIP).
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity of 2014, followed by an updated version in 2017. The Framework, which was developed as a joint effort between the U.S. Federal Government and the private sector, serves only as a guideline and is not mandated by any legal authority. Currently, adoption of the Framework is voluntary. The Financial Sector, one of sixteen Department of Homeland Security critical infrastructure sectors, should be incentivized to adopt the framework, based on inconsistency and accountability of best practices implementation across the sector. Global cyber attack opportunists used the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities and gaps in the U.S. Financial Sector. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides guidelines for strengthening cybersecurity and identifies areas of potential cyber attack impacts. This paper is a summary of the author's published 2021 doctoral dissertation, which includes research and analysis of reported Financial Sector risks, failures and impacts due to weak or lack of cybersecurity controls. The study also provides analysis of success stories of Financial Sector and other entities which have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Dr. Goodwin is a Senior Member of IEEE.
As online forums contain a vast amount of information that can aid in the early detection of fraud and extremist activities, accurate and efficient information extraction from forum sites is very important. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of existing works in the extraction of information from generic web sites and forum sites. We also identify the need for better suited, generalized and lightweight algorithms to carry out a more accurate and efficient information extraction while eliminating noisy data from forum sites. In this paper, we propose three generalized and lightweight algorithms to carry out accurate thread and post content extraction from web forums. We evaluate our algorithms based on two strict criteria and to the granularity of the (DOM tree) node level correctness. We consider a thread or post as successfully extracted by our algorithms only if (i) all the contents in its text and anchor nodes are extracted correctly, and (ii) each content node is grouped correctly according to its respective thread or post. Our experiments on ten different forum sites show that our proposed thread extraction algorithm achieves an average recall and precision rate of 100% and 98.66%, respectively, while our core post extraction algorithm achieves an average recall and precision rate of 99.74% and 99.79%, respectively.
The dark web is a concealed portion of the Internet that can only be accessed through specialized software. Although multiple dark web technologies exist, with a common trait of using encryption to enforce anonymity, the Tor network remains the most prominent dark web network. To visit websites on the network, the user must use a heavily modified Firefox browser. The use of encryption to achieve anonymity poses a significant challenge for law enforcement that wishes to monitor users and content for illicit activity. This study examines Tor by focusing on the network structures created between websites via hyperlinks. Examining hyperlinks can provide insight into how virtual communities form on a network. We explore traditional social disorganization principles as a basis to draw comparisons between these virtual communities and real-life crime-prone neighborhoods. Automated data collection techniques were used to leverage the interconnected nature of domains on Tor. Using social network analysis, website hyperlinks are examined and core sites are identified. The analysis shows that these core sites forma significant portion of all connections made on the network with a density of 0.132. This core serves a critical function and has implications for detecting how users connect on Tor.
Identity theft has been known for some centuries whereby falsified identity documents were misused as well as offences such as impersonating others were common in the society. However, the advent of technology changed the method used for conducting this crime, whereby through the use of the Internet, personal information is can be stolen and misused by criminals. The crime has its causes originating from human error and judgement to failure of computing and networking systems that allow unauthorized access to personal information. In order to provide a better tool of investigating this crime, there is the need to explore the causes of the crime thereby providing a better framework for investigating Identity theft crimes. This study uses Root Cause Analysis (RCA) as a preliminary tool that serves to provide a depicted identification of the causes of Identity theft paving the way into investigating the crime and creating incident response plans.
In this paper, we first identify the need to be equipped with the capability to perform raw volatile memory data acquisition from live smartphones. We then investigate and discuss the potential of different approaches to achieve this task on Symbian smartphones. Based on our initial analysis, we propose a simple, flexible and portable approach which can have a full-coverage view of the memory space, to acquire the raw volatile memory data from commercial Symbian smartphones. We develop the tool to conduct the proof-of-concept experiments on the phones, and are able to acquire the volatile memory data successfully. A discussion on the problems we have encountered, the solutions we have proposed and the observations we have made in this research is provided. With the acquired data, we conduct an analysis on the memory images of the identified memory regions of interest, and propose a methodology for the purpose of in-depth malware security and forensics analysis.
Source Camera identification of digital images can be performed by matching the sensor pattern noise (SPN) of the images with that of the camera reference signature. This paper presents a non-decimated wavelet based source camera identification method for digital images. The proposed algorithm applies a non-decimated wavelet transform on the input image and split the image into its wavelet sub-bands. The coefficients within the resulting wavelet high frequency sub-bands are filtered to extract the SPN of the image. Cross correlation of the image SPN and the camera reference SPN signature is then used to identify the most likely source device of the image. Experimental results were generated using images of ten cameras to identify the source camera of the images. Results show that the proposed technique generates superior results to that of the state of the art wavelet based source camera identification.
This study sought to design a framework to enhance database security in state-owned universities. Database security has been a cause for concern for state-owned universities following many reported cases of state-owned universities that were repeatedly hacked locally and the fact that internationally and there seems to be no strategy in place to guide database security mechanisms in state-owned universities. The study followed a positivist research philosophy using a hypothetical model to test various hypotheses. Through the lens of activity, Social Technology System and deterrence theories, using a survey method to gather the information, the hypotheses were tested and analyzed to further understand security vulnerabilities, security controls and ideal architectural requirements of database security. Quantitative data were collected from 104 respondents using questionnaires. A deductive approach was employed to ensure that the proposed strategy was designed after collecting the necessary data. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. The research findings highlighted the following issues that affect database security: human factor, work environment and technology in use. These issues lead to data exposure, data theft, data corruption, loss of revenue and loss of goodwill. Finally, a framework was proposed that would enhance database security in state-owned universities.
This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research and development in network security that uses graphs and graph-based data representation and analytics. The paper focuses on the graph-based representation of network traffic records and the application of graph-based analytics in intrusion detection and botnet detection. The paper aims to answer several questions related to graph-based approaches in network security, including the types of graphs used to represent network security data, the approaches used to analyze such graphs, the metrics used for detection and monitoring, and the reproducibility of existing works. The paper presents a survey of graph models used to represent, store, and visualize network security data, a survey of the algorithms and approaches used to analyze such data, and an enumeration of the most important graph features used for network security analytics for monitoring and botnet detection. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of using graph-based approaches in network security and identifies potential future research directions. Overall, this survey paper provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of network security who are interested in using graph-based approaches for analyzing and detecting malicious activities in networks.
In recent years, ransomware attacks have led to disastrous consequences for victims, not just due to the payment ransom amount but also due to the recovery costs associated with these attacks. So far only a few empirical studies have analysed the financial impact of ransomware attacks. This study aims to understand the expected financial gains for attackers and financial losses of victims after a ransomware attack. To do so, we build a dataset based on 453 ransomware attack investigation reports in the Netherlands reported to the Dutch Police between 2019 and 2022. Using rational choice model of crime (RCM) and crime scripting we hypothesise that the effort of an attacker, victim characteristics and context variables influence not only the ransom requested by an attacker but also the financial losses reported by victims. We use generalised linear models to evaluate and quantify this influence. Our results show that attacker's efforts such as using Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and victim characteristics such as industry sector, contribute to the ransom requested by attackers and financial losses reported by victims. We also show that the availability of recoverable backups explains the likelihood of victims paying the ransom. A limitation of the present study is the interpretation of the results due to selection bias of victims willing to report to the police. Despite this limitation, we argue that our methodology and results lay the groundwork for future large-scale empirical studies and add to our understanding of attacker and victim behaviour.
The rise of the internet or, more specifically, of services offered and conducted online has led to a dramatic rise in frauds and scams. This study is a systematic review of the literature on the use of crime script analysis in the field of fraud facilitated by the internet to identify stages of the crime commission process across different forms of fraud and examine ways to disrupt those crimes. The scripts for different forms of fraud shared three common elements: communicating with the victim, recruiting enablers, and using money mules. These common elements suggest possible prevention measures. Future applications of crime scripts in the field of fraud and financial crime more broadly are discussed.
In June 2020 India opted for banning 59 Chinese Apps. Contrary to the apprehension of banning gaming apps including PUBG, the government did not do so when the Chinese apps were banned. But soon PUBG also got banned in India. Several stakeholders had raised their concerns in this regard as PUBG may affect the mental health of children who are the major users of this app. But on the other hand, it had been observed that PUBG had remained the biggest respite for children who were confined to homes due to COVID-19. S.69A of the Information Technology Act 2000 (amended in 2008) had been the main tool by the government to block access to Chinese apps. PUBG developers had however tried to outsmart S.69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (amended in 2008), which had been used primarily to block the website and by using Artificial Intelligence for preventing children below 18 from being engaged for a continuous period, being exposed to nudity, etc. This article aims to analyse the tussle between the scope and inherent meaning of S.69A and 79 of the Indian Information technology Act, 2000 (amended in 2008) and the ever-developing due diligence of the game developers with special concern for child safety and mental health of the children, which may make the later a winner or a loser in the legal battleground.
Cybercrimes are evolving on a regular basis and as such these crimes are becoming a greater threat day by day. Earlier these threats were very general and unorganized. In the last decade, these attacks have become highly sophisticated in nature. This higher level of coordination is possible mainly due to botnets, which are clusters of infected hosts controlled remotely by an attacker (botmaster). The number of infected machines is continuously rising, thereby resulting in botnets with over a million infected machines. This powerful capability gives the botmaster a lethal weapon to launch various security attacks. As a result, botnet detection techniques received greater research focus. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a large scale distributed database on the Internet, which is being abused as a botnet communication channel. While there are numerous survey and review papers on botnet detection, there are two survey papers on DNS-based botnet detection which are neither comprehensive nor take into consideration various parameters vital for effective comparison. This survey presents a new classification for DNS-based botnet detection techniques and provides a deep analysis of each technique within the category. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Browser extensions have by and large become a normal and accepted omnipresent feature within modern browsers. However, since their inception, browser extensions have remained under scrutiny for opening vulnerabilities for users. While a large amount of effort has been dedicated to patching such issues as they arise, including the implementation of extension sandboxes and explicit permissions, issues remain within the browser extension ecosystem through user-scripts. User-scripts, or micro-script extensions hosted by a top-level extension, are largely unregulated but inherit the permissions of the top-level application manager, which popularly includes extensions such as Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or xStyle. While most user-scripts are docile and serve a specific beneficial functionality, due to their inherently open nature and the unregulated ecosystem, they are easy for malicious parties to exploit. Common attacks through this method involve hijacking of DOM elements to execute malicious javascript and/or XSS attacks, although other more advanced attacks can be deployed as well. User-scripts have not received much attention, and this vulnerability has persisted despite attempts to make browser extensions more secure. This ongoing vulnerability remains an unknown threat to many users who employ user-scripts, and circumvents security mechanisms otherwise put in place by browsers. This paper discusses this extension derivative vulnerability as it pertains to current browser security paradigms.
An evidence base of what works using high-quality evaluations in tackling societal problems has become the norm in many spheres, including tackling traditional crime. Yet, as we show in the example of fraud faced by organisations, high-quality evaluations are not always possible, or even necessary for tackling problems effectively. Drawing on a review of over 400 research studies exploring the prevention of fraud, this paper finds a paucity of studies meeting the highest quality of standards of evaluation using the Maryland Scale. This is largely because of the barriers to implementing the Maryland Scale, given the challenges of measuring fraud, rather than because of a low quality of research per se. In the absence of high-quality evaluations, this paper uses a novel alternative to the Maryland scale to identify a range of effective tools that organisations can use to prevent fraud. Finally, the paper provides practical and theoretical reflections upon a broader problem of how and to what extent scientific evaluations of high-quality evidence are necessary in combating fraud effectively.
"As violent extremists continue to surface in online discussion forums, counter-extremism agencies search for new and innovative ways of uncovering their digital indicators. Using a sample of approximately 1 million posts and 26,000 unique users across four Islamic-based discussion forums, this study proposed a method of identifying the most radical users on the Dark Web. Several characteristics of each user's postings were analyzed using Parts of Speech (POS) tagging, a custom openNLP based tagger, sentiment analysis, and a novel algorithm called Sentiment-based Identification of Radical Authors (SIRA). POS tagging was used to develop a list of the 400 most frequently cited nouns across the discussion forums. With this list, sentiment analysis provided the context surrounding users' posts, and each post was assigned a polarity value. Radical scores were calculated using SIRA, which is an algorithm that accounts for a user's percentile score for average sentiment score, volume of negative posts, severity of negative posts, and duration of negative posts. Results did not suggest that a simple typology best described the most radical users in the Dark Web; however, the findings indicated that SIRA was flexible enough to evaluate several combinations of online activity that could identify the most radical users in the discussion forums. In addition, SIRA identified the same user across two separate discussion forums as the most radical, thus providing validation for the algorithm. This particular user was linked to an extremist website that supported terrorists. Lastly, the results revealed that the Gawaher and Islamic Awakening web forums hosted the highest volume of most radical users in the sample."
Cybersecurity students need to develop practical skills such as using command-line tools. Hands-on exercises are the most direct way to assess these skills, but assessing students' mastery is a challenging task for instructors. We aim to alleviate this issue by modeling and visualizing student progress automatically throughout the exercise. The progress is summarized by graph models based on the shell commands students typed to achieve discrete tasks within the exercise. We implemented two types of models and compared them using data from 46 students at two universities. To evaluate our models, we surveyed 22 experienced computing instructors and qualitatively analyzed their responses. The majority of instructors interpreted the graph models effectively and identified strengths, weaknesses, and assessment use cases for each model. Based on the evaluation, we provide recommendations to instructors and explain how our graph models innovate teaching and promote further research. The impact of this paper is threefold. First, it demonstrates how multiple institutions can collaborate to share approaches to modeling student progress in hands-on exercises. Second, our modeling techniques generalize to data from different environments to support student assessment, even outside the cybersecurity domain. Third, we share the acquired data and open-source software so that others can use the models in their classes or research.
Cybercriminals use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to prevent their servers from being potentially blacklisted or shut down. Existing reverse engineering techniques for DGA detection is labor intensive, extremely time-consuming, prone to human errors, and have significant limitations. Hence, an automated real-time technique with a high detection rate is warranted in such applications. In this article, we present a novel technique to detect randomly generated domain names and domain name system (DNS) homograph attacks without the need for any reverse engineering or using nonexistent domain (NXDomain) inspection using deep learning. We provide an extensive evaluation of our model over four large, real-world, publicly available datasets. We further investigate the robustness of our model against three different adversarial attacks: DeepDGA, CharBot, and MaskDGA. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method is effectively able to identify DNS homograph attacks and DGAs and also is resilient to common evading cyberattacks. Promising results show that our approach provides a more effective detection rate with an accuracy of 0.99. Additionally, the performance of our model is compared against the most popular deep learning architectures. Our findings highlight the essential need for more robust detection models to counter adversarial learning.
"The article considers the problems associated with the development of new state approaches to ensure the security of critical information infrastructure (hereinafter the CII) in the context of the existence of threats to their information security, including computer attacks in its regard. We analyzed the main provisions of the Federal Law No. 187-FZ dated July 26, 2017 On the Safety of the CII of the Russian Federation. We disclosed the content and essence of the concept of security of the CII. It is justified that the security of the CII shall be based on the principles and methodology of ensuring national security. We have developed proposals to classify part of the subjects of economic activity as the CII subjects, as well as offered some additional mechanisms to increase the security of the CII. We proposed to develop and implement: the federal state standard of higher education in the direction of safety of the CII; retraining and advanced training courses in the direction of safety of the CII; a mechanism for improving the qualifications of officials of the CII subjects on various issues of ensuring its security; security insurance mechanism for the CCI; a mechanism for organizing international, all-Russian, regional and sectoral cyber orders at the CII objects. It has been established that the security of the CII directly depends on the correctness of decision-making in countering computer attacks, the speed and effectiveness of the actions of their entities. It is proved that the criminal law norm on liability for unlawful influence on the CII of the Russian Federation shall be changed."
Despite the constant evolution of similarity searching research, it continues to face challenges stemming from the complexity of the data, such as the curse of dimensionality and computationally expensive distance functions. Various machine learning techniques have proven capable of replacing elaborate mathematical models with simple linear functions, often gaining speed and simplicity at the cost of formal guarantees of accuracy and correctness of querying. The authors explore the potential of this research trend by presenting a lightweight solution for the complex problem of 3D protein structure search. The solution consists of three steps - (i) transformation of 3D protein structural information into very compact vectors, (ii) use of a probabilistic model to group these vectors and respond to queries by returning a given number of similar objects, and (iii) a final filtering step which applies basic vector distance functions to refine the result.
Contrary to the early days in which freedom of access and knowledge for all was a fundamental tenet of the burgeoning internet, today, the internet is a hostile environment. This paper represents that practices of trusted autonomous systems and zero trust must reside both organisationally and in any connected device, and that they will be insufficient to secure any hyperconnected system. For example, in the area of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), the emphasis of standards associated with cybersecurity is to protect vehicles from an external attack, particularly where it may have an impact on safety. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a subset of the IoT. Security of the IoT has not been standardised and is applied by proprietary organisations. Little consideration has been given to the IoV not being the target of an attack, but a means to an end. Vehicles necessarily communicate with the infrastructure and other vehicles. Additionally, outsourced organisational systems and third-party components within a complex, interconnected, communicating system renders it impossible to define and secure all endpoints. Malware in any part of the hyperconnected systems, provides opportunities for hackers. The security of the systems is only as strong as its weakest link. As an example of an onward attack, a DDOS attack is a debilitating exhaustion of resources attack that disables intended operation of a system. Formation of a botnet from the IoV for use in onward attacks is hypothesised. Such a botnet could have a global reach. Research has indicated that the complete cleansing of a computer-based botnet could take between 5 and 15 years. However, with decentralised command and control and peer to peer communication, the botnet could remain persistent. It is shown that persistent botnet formation software is readily available on the dark market and that specialist software can be commissioned as Crime as a Service. Organised crime groups have already reverse engineered vehicle systems. Mobile attack platform swarms are an attractive proposition to the malefactor, and with the potential for global reach, perhaps the next step on from ransomware. Intermittent disruption from mobile sources is hard to trace and there is an existing pool of 1.2 billion vehicles.
In this short paper, we take a first step towards empirically assessing Internet-wide malicious activities generated from and targeted towards Internet-scale business sectors (i.e., financial, health, education, etc.) and critical infrastructure (i.e., utilities, manufacturing, government, etc.). Facilitated by an innovative and a collaborative large-scale effort, we have conducted discussions with numerous Internet entities to obtain rare and private information related to allocated IP blocks pertaining to the aforementioned sectors and critical infrastructure. To this end, we employ such information to attribute Internet-scale maliciousness to such sectors and realms, in an attempt to provide an in-depth analysis of the global cyber situational posture. We draw upon close to 16.8 TB of darknet data to infer probing activities (typically generated by malicious/infected hosts) and DDoS backscatter, from which we distill IP addresses of victims. By executing week-long measurements, we observed an alarming number of more than 11,000 probing machines and 300 DDoS attack victims hosted by critical sectors. We also generate rare insights related to the maliciousness of various business sectors, including financial, which typically do not report their hosted and targeted illicit activities for reputation-preservation purposes. While we treat the obtained results with strict confidence due to obvious sensitivity reasons, we postulate that such generated cyber threat intelligence could be shared with sector/critical infrastructure operators, backbone networks and Internet service providers to contribute to the overall threat remediation objective.
A negative outcome of the nascent cashless policy in Nigeria has been persistent electronic banking fraud (e-fraud). Fraud occurrence in any financial space indicates insecurity and loopholes being exploited by fraudsters. This underscores the importance of trust governance in electronic banking and its centrality in a transiting cashless economy like Nigeria. Against this background, we investigated e-banking fraud and the role trust governance plays in both the adoption and refusal to migrate and use electronic banking in Nigeria. Using qualitative methods (in-depth and key informant interviews) of data collection, 30 participants were purposively selected and in some instances reached through the snowball and referral methods. Findings showed internal, external, and collaborative dimensions of e-fraud. Experiences of fraud reportedly affected adoption and migration of bank customers to e-banking platforms. Although weak governance mechanism was reported, banks nonetheless are embracing security mechanisms such as sending SCAM alert messages to customers, while shaming and sack of compromised staff were employed as within-bank measures to secure the confidence of customers in the evolving financial ecosystem.
This research utilizes social network analysis to determine the success of three different disruption strategies on a child exploitation network extracted from the public internet. Using a custom-written web-crawler called LECEN, data from a set of hyperlinked child-exploitation websites was collected from the Internet. From these data, two types of networks were coded: the nodes of the first network consisted of only website domains, while the nodes of the second were generated using the registrant data, where the nodes represented the legal owners of those same domains. Three attack scenarios were carried out on these two networks: two types of hub attacks (one focused on in-degree and one focused on out-degree) and a bridge attack. Using these disruption strategies, it was found that bridge attacks were more suitable for disrupting the domain networks, while both hub-attacks could be favored when disrupting the network of registrants. These findings have implications for law enforcement, as it provides real-world applications to disruption where registrants may be targeted directly.
Purpose The purpose of this study is to focus on organisation's cybersecurity strategy and propose a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness to be used when targeting small- and medium-sized enterprises/businesses (SMEs/SMBs) at a city-level. An essential component of an organisation's cybersecurity strategy is building awareness and education of online threats and how to protect corporate data and services. This programme is based on existing research and provides a unique insight into an ongoing city-based project with similar aims. Design/methodology/approach To structure this work, a scoping review was conducted of the literature in cybersecurity education and awareness, particularly for SMEs/SMBs. This theoretical analysis was complemented using a case study and reflecting on an ongoing, innovative programme that seeks to work with these businesses to significantly enhance their security posture. From these analyses, best practices and important lessons/recommendations to produce a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness were recommended. Findings While the literature can be informative at guiding education and awareness programmes, it may not always reach real-world programmes. However, existing programmes, such as the one explored in this study, have great potential, but there can be room for improvement. Knowledge from each of these areas can, and should, be combined to the benefit of the academic and practitioner communities. Originality/value The study contributes to current research through the outline of a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness targeting SMEs/SMBs. Through this research, literature in this space was examined and insights into the advances and challenges faced by an on-going programme were presented. These analyses allow us to craft a proposal for a core programme that can assist in improving the security education, awareness and training that targets SMEs/SMBs.
An analysis of a host behavior is an essential key for modern network management and security. A robust behavior profile enables the network managers to detect anomalies with high accuracy, predict the host behavior, or group host to clusters for better management. Hence, host profiling methods attract the interest of many researchers, and novel methods for host profiling are being introduced. However, these methods are frequently developed on preprocessed and small datasets. Therefore, they do not reflect the real-world artifacts of the host profiling, such as missing observations, temporal patterns, or variability in the profile characteristics in time. To provide the needed insight into the artifacts of host profiling in real-world settings, we present a study of the host behavior in a network conducted on a one-year-long real-world network dataset. In the study, we inspect the availability of the data for host profiling, identify the temporal patterns in host behavior, introduce a method for stable labeling of the hosts, and assess the variability of the host characteristics in the course of the year using the coefficient of variance. Moreover, we make the one-year dataset containing nine characteristics used for host behavior analysis available for public use and further research, including selected use cases representing host profiling caveats. We also share the record of analysis presented in the paper.
In this paper, researchers provide a preliminary analysis on the forensic implications of cloud computing reference architecture, on the segregation of duties of cloud actors in cloud investigations, forensic artifacts on all layers of cloud system stack, cloud actors interaction scenarios in cloud investigations, and forensic implications of all cloud deployment models. The analysis serves as feedback and input for integrating forensic considerations into cloud standardization processes from early stage, and specifies requirements and directions for further standardization efforts.
Access control has been proposed asthe solution to prevent unauthorized accesses to sensitive system resources. Historically, access control models use a two-valued decision set to indicate whether an access should be granted or denied. Many access control models have extended the two-valued decision set to indicate, for instance, whether a policy is applicable to an access query or an error occurred during policy evaluation. Decision sets are often coupled with operators for combining decisions from multiple applicable policies. Although a larger decision set is more expressive, it may be necessary to reduce it to a smaller set in order to simplify the complexity of decision making or enable comparison between access control models. Moreover, some access control mechanisms like XACML v3 uses more than one decision set. The projection from one decision set to the other may result in a loss of accuracy, which can affect the final access decision. In this paper, we present a formal framework for the analysis and comparison of decision sets centered on the notion of decision reduction. In particular, we introduce the notion of safe reduction, which ensures that a reduction can be performed at any level of policy composition without changing the final decision. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing XACML v3 against the notion of safe reduction. From this analysis, we draw guidelines for the selection of the minimal decision set with respect to a given set of combining operators.
Most research on internet-frauds has focused on victims' cognitive and personality vulnerabilities and ignored that scammers often have been victims of financial cyber-crimes [1]. These victim-offenders expressed retaliation as a motive to offend and highlight the overlooked emotions and social learning contributing to cyberscams [2]. A broader understanding of the motives, emotions and knowledge of victim-offenders, solely offenders and solely victims might improve awareness campaigns and security training [3]. In this talk, I use a life-course perspective of social learning [4] to examine media and social sources, prior victimization, and knowledge and attitudes about relationships contribute to committing internet frauds. Data are drawn from two large self-report surveys of victimization and perpetration of a wide range of internet frauds. Deviant friends and family members, mentors, online discussions, and contacts in the dark web increase support for retaliation and provide praise for perpetrating internet-fraud. Those who attended victim support groups and have knowledge of dating app etiquette have more accurate knowledge about suspicious communications on dating apps. Beyond low self-control, psychopathy and committing frauds in the real world, those with higher rates of victimization more often perpetrated cyber-frauds. The life-course perspective suggests a broader view of the emotional and social context of offending might improve the content and focus of awareness campaigns and security training. These campaigns and training often ignore how scammers learn manipulative tactics from friends, family, media, and online sources. This focus also might enhance AI tools to detect and intercept fraudulent messages on dating and social media sites.
"In recent years, widespread internet usage, increasing numbers of IoT devices, and vast data on social media have increased cyber attack vectors. Parallel to this trend, the demand for the cyber security workforce has augmented; however, employers could not fill these positions due to the shortage in the field. This anomaly, in turn, has placed companies in a vulnerable situation by being exposed to an increased level of cyber security threats/incidents. Relevant authorities underscore the importance of a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce framework to overcome this problem. Given this context, this study offers a CyberSec Labs framework to improve the skills of potential cybersecurity actors. The framework extensively benefits from hands-on exercises like cloud computing and networking, OSINT, data-driven cybersecurity approach, vulnerability and penetration test analysis, and volatility analysis. The overall goal of this open-source material is to prepare students for their future cybersecurity roles, which contributes to overcoming the shortage of skilled human capital in the cybersecurity field."
"The total number of webpages has grown substantially since the birth of the Internet. So too have the number of webpages dedicated to radical yet subtle content. As these new circumstances have necessitated a guided data collection method, one that can sidestep the laborious manual methods that have been classically utilized, simple keyword analysis has not been sufficient to identify radical sites on Web 1.0 pro-extremist, anti-extremist, and news sites, for example, may use the same keywords to discuss the same event but have a very different motivation. In an effort to explore this problem, we completed an exercise involving the use of a web-crawler to collect 20,000 webpages from five sentiment-based classes to assess their differences: (1) radical Right sites; (2) radical Islamic sites; (3) anti-extremist sites; (4) news source sites discussing extremism; and (5) sites that did not discuss extremism. Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging was used to identify 198 of the most frequent keywords within the data, and the sentiment value for each of these keywords was calculated for each webpage using sentiment analysis. With these values, a decision tree was applied to three classification models. Results suggest that radical Islamic text can be classified at a much higher rate of success than radical Right text."
The Scientific and Technical Revolution 5.0 and WEB 3.0 technologies create conditions for the renovation of various forms of social relations with the use of virtual and augmented reality technologies in the metaverse. According to the proposed theory, the legal regulation of social relations in the metaverse requires the development of a comprehensive electronic jurisdiction based on the latest basic legislation. The formation of legal regulation of the metaverse is a prerequisite for the need to form an electronic jurisdiction of the metaverse, which will include sectoral Metaverse Codes. The metaverse, as the electronic society of the future, does not yet have clear legal boundaries, and the task of scholars is to predict and outline with sufficient certainty the future contours of legal authority for virtual environments. Today, discussions in the scientific community about the feasibility and necessity of legal regulation of the metaverse often revolve around several key issues. First, there is the question of what legal framework should be applied in the metaverse and how conflicts between different legal systems should be resolved. Second, there is a debate about whether current regulatory bodies in the physical world have the capacity to effectively regulate the metaverse through existing laws and regulations. Third, there is the question of how to deal with offences committed in the virtual environment, and whether they should be dealt with under existing tort or criminal law, or whether a separate cross-border electronic jurisdiction should be created. The regulation of social relations in the metaverse should focus on one central goal: to clearly define the status of electronic entities, subjects and objects, to establish their rights, duties and responsibilities, and to define the different types of relations between virtual entities, subjects and objects within a given metaverse, as well as between different metaverses within an electronic jurisdiction and in a cross-border context. An essential component of the Metaverse Electronic Jurisdiction is a Metaverse Model Criminal Code that will outline the norms and offences applicable to analogue, hybrid and electronic jurisdictions. This code will define the types of socially harmful acts or crimes and the corresponding criminal penalties that will be applied within the metaverse. The formation of the electronic jurisdiction of the metaverse and the development of a Metaverse Model Criminal Code is a current scientific and legal issue.
"PurposeThe metaverse is the new buzzword. With the phenomenal growth of the metaverse comes accounting, taxation and jurisdictional challenges, which business and governments have yet to fully address. This paper aims to highlight and rationalise the lack of regulatory framework and multiplicity of jurisdictions on metaverse transactions. This paper addresses some of the complications with respect to accounting and taxation in virtual environments. Design/methodology/approachThis study relies on secondary data and emerging literature to understand the multiplicity of jurisdiction and complexity of the accounting transactions. The concept of the metaverse is rapidly evolving, and this study uses extant literature to provide the foundation for understanding the key challenges relating to accounting and taxation. FindingsConcepts of revenue recognition and deferment are challenged by the transactions in the metaverse. There are novel applications, underpinned by emerging technologies and blockchain supporting new crypto assets, such as non-fungible tokens and other decentralised finance (DeFi) tools; however, the caveats of anonymity and jurisdictional issues persist. The paper suggests that the industry must adapt to the unique reporting requirements of these assets and develop new standards for evaluating their value for financial reporting purposes. The paper emphasises the need for a case-based approach in the absence of standardised regulations for the accounting industry in the metaverse. Originality/valueThis paper adds original contributions to extant literature of the metaverse and advances ongoing debates into the accounting and taxation issues pertinent to the metaverse and DeFi."
In this paper we present a shortened version of the Cloud Forensic Maturity Model (CFMM). It composes of two inter-related parts, i.e., the Cloud Forensic Investigative Architecture (CFIA) and the Cloud Forensic Capability Matrix (CFCM). The CFMM is developed in order to create a reference model to evaluate and improve cloud forensic maturity. It is a part an on-going project, and is evaluted by a panel of experts and practitioners as a first step for further cloud forensic standardization efforts.
EU criminal policy making is a relatively new policy domain and its credibility is said to be undermined by the lack of an evidence base. Because the EU claims to pursue evidence based policy making, this justifies reviewing the mechanisms put in place to that end. To properly evaluate the evidence base in EU criminal policy making, an assessment is made of the availability of comparable crime statistics. Crime statistics, a vital data source for criminal policy making, are considered highly problematic at EU level due to (amongst other reasons) the differences in the definition of the offences. In spite of the good intentions that can be read into the repeated acknowledgement of the importance of crime statistics and the efforts to commonly define EU worthy offences, a thorough empirical analysis leads to the conclusion that we are still in search of valid EU level data with respect to the EU level offences. The EU as a policy maker does not take its responsibility to ensure the availability of the necessary comparable crime statistical data serious enough.
Network-based monitoring and intrusion detection systems generate a high number of alerts reporting the suspicious activity of IP addresses. The majority of alerts are dropped due to their low relevance, low priority, or due to high number of alerts themselves. We assume that these alerts still contain valuable information, namely, about the coordination of IP addresses. Knowledge of the coordinated IP addresses improves situational awareness and reflects the requirement of security analysts as well as automated reasoning tools to have as much contextual information as possible to make an informed decision. To validate our assumption, we introduce a novel method to discover the groups of coordinated IP addresses that exhibit a temporal correlation of their alerts. We evaluate our method on data from a real sharing platform reporting approximately 1.5 million alerts per day. The results show that our method can indeed discover groups of truly coordinated IP addresses.
The advent of the internet has unfortunately increased the scale and complexity of child exploitation material (CEM) with content increasingly moving online, forming online CEM networks through a series of websites that are hyperlinked to each other and lead consumers from one website to another. Extending on prior research focusing on examining network structure and network disruption strategies it was prudent to expand avenues to increase attack strategies. Geolocation and Whois data were utilized to map the prevalence of CEM globally. Differences in the Geolocation and Whois data were observed, suggesting both are critical pieces of information in generating accurate geo-mapping of CEM. These maps show how multi-jurisdictional attack strategies may be employed to attack these networks and remove this content.
In this study we used social network analysis of incel-related videos on YouTube to understand the recommendations, patterns, and dissemination of incel ideology on a popular multimedia platform, i.e., YouTube. Results revealed 12 distinct groups in the network (e.g., Female Hypergamy, Gynocentric Bias). Central videos in each group revealed the spread of ideological material on YouTube. Videos with the highest betweenness centrality scores were evaluated to map the pathways from groups with more innocuous video content to groups with more extremist incel-ideological content.
Recovering deleted information is one of the most important probative elements in a forensic investigation that involves a mobile phone. In this paper, we present a new tool implementing an innovative method, based on a low-level analysis, to recover deleted data from SQLite databases on Android devices, taking as an initial example text messages. The paper then proposes a generic framework for deleted data recovery that can be used with a range of SQLite databases on a variety of Android systems and devices. Indeed, although our initial aim was to recover deleted SMSs, we realized along the way that, with the appropriate changes, the initial implemented method can be applicable to the extraction of deleted information from any SQLite database file.
Artificial Intelligence is a growing field in technology that mimics the human neural network in order to deduct patterns based on specific datasets. Unlike conventional methods of programming where the code is told explicit rules, AI uses data to predict processes. However, due to AI's prediction of future behavior, it is highly susceptible to data tampering from adversaries who may flood the program with false information. Previous solutions have utilized random sampling, active learning, blockchain and human interaction in order to solve AI bias. In this paper we propose a scheme to address the AI bias by using a method of random sampling in order to mitigate the destruction done to hacked systems while maintaining prediction reliability.
This paper shares our three years of experience in conducting collaborative-based cybersecurity teaching involving industrial-expertise sharing and an authentic-learning environment. Penetration testing (pen-testing) is widely adopted in the cybersecurity industry. It requires a wide range of skillsets, including non-technical aspects, which are not easy to be acquired in a standard lecture-style setting. While the fundamentals of the skillsets could be taught separately in different modules, an integrated pen-testing module using real-world target applications will provide students with a bird's-eye view of security assessment in an authentic learning setting. There exist, however, challenges in providing a sustainable structured pen-testing module. These include the evolving industrial best practices and availability of authentic target environments. In this paper, we share our experience as well as best practices in designing and teaching a pen-testing module in our Bachelor of Computing degree program. The module unconventionally adopts a fruitful win-win collaborative paradigm. The students, guided along by professional pen-testers from the industry and academic instructors, pen-test our University's operational applications selected by the University IT Department. With the completed six semesters to date, our students have tested various applications, including our University's learning management system, student registration system, and student-hall dining system, which all manage sensitive data. We have received very positive feedback from the parties involved. This paper describes our module's rationale, involved parties and roles, class arrangements and activities, as well as grading considerations. The paper also discusses encountered issues and our adopted solutions related to University application selection, student contribution assessment, and activity arrangements during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some notes are additionally given for others who are keen to offer similar modules using the same teaching pedagogy. Our experience thus demonstrates that, while provisioning industrial collaboration and authentic learning in education needs to address several technical and administrative issues, a collaborative based teaching paradigm can work well in a sustainable manner.
The increasing demand of smart security systems has enhanced the demand for the proper identification and verification of a person. In this context, accurate estimation of age as well as proper identification of gender is highly significant. Therefore, in this work, we have implemented two separate methods with satisfactory runtime and efficiency to estimate both human age and gender using facial images. Our image processing based method involves comparison of some features extracted from the post-processed facial images of people of various age ranges followed by some edge-detection procedures, creation of binary masks and evaluation of wrinkle densities. Afterwards, thresholds were set via Naive Bayes Classification to estimate classes. For the assessment purpose, we developed a database namely BUET facial database, which consists of images of both male and female of diverse ages. For the developed database, our proposed algorithm exhibits 76.3% accuracy in the age group classification while it shows 86.6% accuracy in the gender classification. Apart from BUET facial database, our developed algorithm has also been tested in three other databases and compared its performance with the reported literature for these databases. The mean absolute error is almost below 5.0 for this work, whereas, others exceed 5.0 in most of the cases. Moreover, the proposed algorithm exhibits reasonably good accuracy under different lighting conditions of images as well. Our study would provide further insight into the choice of appropriate features for the efficient and accurate estimation of the age and the gender of a person.
In the past few years blockchains have been a major focus for security research, resulting in significant progress in the design, formalization, and analysis of blockchain protocols. However, the more general class of distributed ledgers, which includes not just blockchains but also prominent non-blockchain protocols, such as Corda and OmniLedger, cannot be covered by the state-of-the-art in the security literature yet. These distributed ledgers often break with traditional blockchain paradigms, such as block structures to store data, system-wide consensus, or global consistency. In this paper, we close this gap by proposing the first framework for defining and analyzing the security of general distributed ledgers, with an ideal distributed ledger functionality, called F-ledger, at the core of our contribution. This functionality covers not only classical blockchains but also non-blockchain distributed ledgers in a unified way. To illustrate F-ledger, we first show that the prominent ideal blockchain functionalities g(ledger) and g(PL) realize (suitable instantiations of) F-ledger, which captures their security properties. This implies that their respective implementations, including Bitcoin, Ouroboros Genesis, and Ouroboros Crypsinous, realize F-ledger as well. Secondly, we demonstrate that F-ledger is capable of precisely modeling also non-blockchain distributed ledgers by performing the first formal security analysis of such a distributed ledger, namely the prominent Corda protocol. Due to the wide spread use of Corda in industry, in particular the financial sector, this analysis is of independent interest. These results also illustrate that F-ledger not just generalizes the modular treatment of blockchains to distributed ledgers, but moreover helps to unify existing results.
Recent studies have shown the possible negative effects of children's early exposure to digital content with particular reference to screen time. In fact, excessive use of Digital Media (DM) can have important repercussions on development, learning and the quality of family life. In addition, Internet -connected devices represent the key to accessing digital subculture, the content of which can have a negative impact on children's psychological and physical development. Given the impact of DM and in particular of digital subculture on children, pre-adolescents and adolescents, we propose to broaden the concept of health by including not only the biological, psychological and social dimensions but also the digital dimension and thus the relationship with digital devices. In this work, we introduce the concept of Digital Health (DH), which refers to the well-being of all individuals, in particular of subjects of developmental age, exposed to digital devices, and we provide paediatricians with a new health procedure, called Evaluation of Digital Health (EDH). The EDH, aimed at assessing the digital habits, screen time and digital content viewed by the child, is carried out during periodic check-ups. In fact, we believe that paediatricians have a fundamental role in the protection of all-round health, including DH. The EDH would enable paediatricians, who follow growth from birth to adolescence, to prevent and/or promptly pick up on the signs of any risky digital behaviour displayed by parents and their children. From this perspective, the paediatrician may lead to the manifestation of appropriate digital behaviours, thus representing the first DH promotion service and fostering the development of digital awareness in the family.
In this paper, we introduce a concept to counter the current weakness of robust hashing with respect to cropping. We combine face detectors and robust hashing. By doing so, the detected faces become a subarea of the overall image which always can be found as long as cropping of the image does not remove the faces. As the face detection is prone to a drift effect altering size and position of the detected face, further mechanisms are needed for robust hashing. We show how face segmentation utilizing blob algorithms can be used to implement a face-based cropping robust hash algorithm.
In many developed countries, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become important in paving the future path in how data is managed and secured in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sector. SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries' SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs' management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs' lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path.
A workflow is resilient when the unavailability of some users does not force to choose between a violation of the security policy or an early termination of the workflow. Although checking for the resiliency of a workflow is a well-studied problem, solutions usually only provide a binary answer to the problem, leaving a workflow designer with little help when the workflow is not resilient. We propose in this paper to provide instead a measure of quantitative resiliency, indicating how much a workflow is likely to terminate for a given security policy and a given user availability model. We define this notion by encoding the resiliency problem as a decision problem, reducing the finding of an optimal user-task assignment to that of solving a Markov Decision Process. We illustrate the flexibility of our encoding by considering different measures of resiliency, and we empirically analyse them, showing the existence of a trade-off between multiple aspects such as success rate, expected termination step and computation time, thus providing a toolbox that could help a workflow designer to improve or fix a workflow.
Linux is considered to be less prone to malware compared to other operating systems, and as a result Linux users rarely run anti-malware. However, many popular software applications released on other platforms cannot run natively on Linux. Wine is a popular compatibility layer for running Windows programs on Linux. The level of security risk that Wine poses to Linux users is largely undocumented. This project was conducted to assess the security implications of using Wine, and to determine if any specific types of malware or malware behavior have a significant effect on the malware being successful in Wine. Dynamic analysis (both automated and manual) was applied to 30 malware samples both in a Windows environment and Linux environment running Wine. Behavior analyzed included file system, registry, and network access, and the spawning of processes, and services. The behavior was compared to determine malware success in Wine. The study results provide evidence that Wine can pose serious security implications when used to run Windows software in a Linux environment. Five samples of Windows malware were run successfully through Wine on a Linux system. No significant relationships were discovered between the success of the malware and its high-level behavior or malware type. However, certain API calls could not be recreated in a Linux environment, and led to failure of malware to execute via Wine. This suggests that particular malware samples that utilize these API calls will never run completely successfully in a Linux environment. As a consequence, the success of some samples can be determined from observing the API calls when run within a Windows environment.
This paper describes the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) with a focus on relevance to digital forensic investigators. RDAP was developed as the successor to the aging WHOIS system and is intended to eventually replace WHOIS as the authoritative source for registration information on IP addresses, Domain Names, Autonomous Systems, and more. RDAP uses a RESTful interface over HTTP and introduces a number of new features related to security, internationalization, and standardized query/response definitions. It is important for digital forensic investigators to become familiar with RDAP as it will play an increasingly important role in Internet investigations requiring the search and collection of registration data as evidence.

"To assess the efficacy of routine activity theory (RAT) for explaining phishing victimization and guide evidence-based policy, we launched two phishing attacks via a university Listserv (N = 25,875). The first email offered access to a pdf file; the second offered free concert tickets. Several interesting findings emerged demonstrating phishing victimization results from network users' routine behaviors. Students were significantly less likely to open the phishing email sharing a pdf but more likely to open the email offering free concert tickets. Moreover, students were more likely to click the malicious link embedded within the phishing email in both studies, often using mobile devices. Conversely, employees were more likely to click the link while connected to the university network, thus exposing the network to greater levels of risk. Finally, the email offering concert tickets was opened at a frequency more than double the email containing the pdf. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed."
Probabilistic and stochastic models are routinely used in performance, dependability and security evaluation, and determining appropriate values for model parameters is a long-standing problem in the practical use of such models. With the increasing emphasis on human aspects and business considerations, data collection to estimate parameter values often gets prohibitively expensive, since it may involve questionnaires, costly audits or additional monitoring and processing. In this paper we articulate a set of optimization problems related to data collection, and provide efficient algorithms to determine the optimal data collection strategy for a model. The main idea is to model the uncertainty of data sources and determine its influence on output accuracy by solving the model. This approach is particularly natural for data sources that rely on sampling, such as questionnaires or monitoring, since uncertainty can be expressed using the central limit theorem. We pay special attention to the efficiency of our optimization algorithm, using ideas inspired by importance sampling to derive optimal strategies for a range of parameter values from a single set of experiments.
"Research SummaryThis article investigates the contributing factors (or triggers) to a realization of romance fraud victimization, based on 1015 reports lodged with Scamwatch (Australian online reporting portal for fraud) between July 2018 and July 2019 (inclusive). The article examines the free text narrative of each report to propose five discernible trigger categories: further requests for money; characteristics of communications; verification checks; an offender's action(s); and being told by a third party.Policy ImplicationsBased on a comprehensive understanding of these five categories, the article advocates for broader messaging approaches to encompass financial literacy and well-being, cyberliteracy and critical thinking skills, cybersecurity practices, and respectful and healthy relationships. Leveraging the use of these wider education and awareness campaigns could improve recognition of romance fraud. Importantly, it is suggested that banks and other financial institutions are in a strong position to focus their efforts on some of these broader messages to effect positive change."
Today's requirements for visualization of geospatial data are continually rising. Visualization authoring tools provide only limited support for this purpose. The ability to create geovisualizations by non-programmers is often reliant on template editing or visualization authoring tools. However, these tools are often limited either in configuring visual parameters or interaction capabilities. In our work, we identify the main limitations of current tools. Then, we propose design requirements and describe the implementation of Geovisto-a toolkit combining capabilities of the React, Leaflet, and D3.js frameworks in order to provide tools for processing generic geospatial data and creating multilayered reusable map widgets. We demonstrate our approach on two usage scenarios from conceptually different application areas (DDoS attacks from a network monitoring system and COVID-19 pandemics open data). Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our approach and outline our future work.
As organized criminals use instant messengers, it becomes increasingly important to obtain digital evidence from instant messengers. Recently, instant messengers apply end-to-end encryption, so all digital evidence can only be obtained from your mobile device. However, some instant messengers encrypt and store database and multimedia files, making forensic analysis of mobile devices difficult. In this paper, we present a methodology for analyzing the decryption algorithm of the messenger, and apply this methodology to Signal, Wickr, and Threema. We extracted data from both unrooted and rooted devices and performed static and dynamic analysis. As a result, we succeeded in decrypting all the encrypted database, multimedia, log, and preferences files of three messengers. We describe the decryption algorithms and disclose all decryption scripts.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
An intrusion and attack detection system usually focuses on classifYing a record as either normal or abnormal. In some cases such as insider attacks, attackers rely on feedback from the attacked system, which enables them to gradually manipulate their attempts in order to avoid detection. This paper proposes the notion of accumulative manipulation that can be observed through a number of attempts accomplished by the attacker, which forms the basis of the Attacker Learning Curve (ALC). Based on a controlled experiment, we first show that the ALC for three different attack strategies are consistent between two different groups of subjects. We then define a strategy detection mechanism, which is experimentally shown to be accurate more than 70% of the time.
As the data generated on the internet exponentially increases, developing guided data collection methods become more and more essential to the research process. This paper proposes an approach to building a self-guiding web-crawler to collect data specifically from extremist websites. The guidance component of the web-crawler is achieved through the use of sentiment-based classification rules which allow the crawler to make decisions on the content of the webpage it downloads. First, content from 2,500 webpages was collected for each of the four different sentiment based classes: pro-extremist webs ites, anti-extremist websites, neutral news sites discussing extremism and finally sites with no discussion of extremism. Then parts of speech tagging was used to find the most frequent keywords in these pages. Utilizing sentiment software in conjunction with classification software a decision tree that could effectively discern which class a particular page would fall into was generated. The resulting tree showed an 80% success rate on differentiating between the four classes and a 92% success rate at classifying specifically extremist pages. This decision tree was then applied to a randomly selected sample of pages for each class. The results from the secondary test showed similar results to the primary test and hold promise for future studies using this framework.
The Internet of Things (IoT) nowadays plays an essential and critical role in our lives and is beginning to dominate Internet communications. The twenty-first century will continue to witness exponential growth and dependence on IoT systems in all aspects of life from smart homes, smart vehicles, e-health, smart cities, and smart grid to wearables, and medical devices that are becoming more microscopic due to the increase in processing ability and communications capabilities. The massive deployment of IoT devices in various domains has increased security threats to IoT devices and systems and created internet of vulnerabilities. Different bodies have proposed several fundamental architectural models for IoT. Privacy and security requirements and challenges of IoT are different from any other types of communications. Building trust between different entities and systems is the motive behind this work. This paper proposes a novel security architecture framework for IoT.
The increasing interconnectedness of countries and national critical infrastructures in today's global network society has ushered the world into what has been aptly described as an age of interdependence where each nation's security is also dependent on the actions of the other nations of the world[1]. This state of affairs emphasizes the need for the collective responsibility of states for global cybersecurity. This paper examines some strategies towards enhancing the collective responsibility of states to address the challenge of cyber terrorism. It particularly suggests the need for a state to be held accountable where its failure to establish regulatory measures to deter or prosecute cybercrimes or cyber terrorism within it territories has allowed the perpetration of such that produced trans-boundary effects in other states.
This Chapter begins by outlining the problem in defining and understanding the interrelationship between privacy and data protection law in Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the European Union. This Chapter will demonstrate and discuss how the concept of privacy is considered an important feature of the modern era. In other words, it is argued that there has been wide acceptance and a convergence of privacy that now transcends, government, countries, cultures religion over the Internet. This convergence of the concept of privacy, has resulted in nation states adopting to varying degrees, data protection and privacy laws. However, it will be highlighted that the current day approach needs further development and greater convergence and harmonization of data protection law and policy at the international level. This will be important as the trade in personal data continues to grow. It will be argued in this Chapter that the privacy and data protection law of these jurisdictions is far from settled. It is further argued that data protection and privacy law has two dimensions. First, is to protect personal data and information of individuals, as a human right. Second, is balancing the protection of personal data with current and future economic activity (trade) of personal data. Moreover, data protection and privacy cannot be restricted to a single country or region of the world. It is international, and has been underpinned by Internet technology and infrastructure that knows no [national] borders. Thus, these laws, while being developed by nation states for their own particular sovereign needs, the internationalization of the Internet poses significant challenges to the future law and policy in this area. They are likely to continue to be challenged and require reviewing and updating, as technology continues to change. Being a recent addition to the law, data protection is also challenging and is arguably in conflict with other areas of the law, such as intellectual property, competition, transnational commercial contract law, and cybercrime-security law. This Chapter also highlights the structure of the overall book in recognizing and responding to these differences in data protection and privacy law. It argues that data protection is a tool of Internet privacy. At the recent June 2019 meeting of the G20, the leaders' declaration called for respect of national and international regulation of data and technology. The importance of this declaration highlights the importance for governments to balance innovation with protection of personal data. To achieve this, the book reinforces the G20 leaders position, and goes a step further, by recommending that an international Model Law be developed, similar to international trade law. Also, consideration to an international treaty or convention will support any model law and go some way to closing the gaps and tensions between country data protection law. Thus, this book calls for greater legal convergence and harmonization in this emerging and complex area of law and policy. The book also identifies that personal data being afforded an intellectual property right. It also highlights the tension between data protection and competition law and cybersecurity/crime law. It will also be argued that data protection can fall within the current transnational international contract legal framework. Adopting data protection within these areas of law, provide valuable tools to strengthen the governance, control and regulation of personal data.
Social scientists have long been interested in the motives of hackers, particularly financially motivated attackers. This article analyzes web defacements, a less studied and more public form of cyberattack, in which the content of a web page is deliberately substituted with unwanted text and graphics chosen by the perpetrator. These attacks use a variety of strategies and are performed for a variety of motives, including political and ideological goals. The proliferation of such attacks has resulted in vast amounts of data that open new opportunities for qualitative and quantitative analysis. This article explores the usefulness of machine learning techniques to better understand attacker strategies and motivations. To detect overall attack patterns, this analysis utilized a sample of 40,000 images posted on defaced websites analyzed through deep machine learning methods. The approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches for the study of cyberattacks, but it also reveals the considerable challenges that need to be overcome.
"The purpose of this study is to investigate the application of forensic accounting techniques in relation to fraud risk mitigation. This study employed an explanatory research design and a qualitative approach accompanied with a purposive sampling method. A primary data source was devised with a focus on the 17 licensed commercial banks registered in South Africa. By obtaining a true reflection of the situations in the banks, a conclusion was drawn following the outcome of the inferential statistical analysis. The research was conducted at the individual and organisational levels, with the bank consultants presenting their views. One hypothesis was formulated and non-parametric statistical analyses involving the use of Chi-square test, Fisher's Exact test and Spearman's correlation were carried out. The results obtained substantiate that the loopholes created as a result of non-effective application of forensic techniques are partly responsible for some cyberfraud incidents in the banking industry. There is no sufficient evidence to ascertain whether the fraud risk assessment and management in the banking industry has a relationship with the effective application of forensic accounting techniques in terms of the identified causes of cyberfraud. However, the findings establish a positive correlation between fraud risk assessment and management as it relates to forensic accounting implementation. This study provides an insight into the significance of forensic accounting applications for fraud risk mitigation. There is still a death of information regarding the forensic accounting for fraud risk mitigation; hence, it is envisaged that this study will add to the existing literature in this regard."
This articles analyses a contemporary problem, which has not been thoroughly analysed in scientific literature - Estimation of Digital Shadow Economy through a modified MIMIC model. It is the first pilot research of such type, which allows to reveal the need of deeper data analysis and data collection. Received results show, that three causal factors (internet access, and PC availability for households, non-cash payments, placement of innovative financial instruments on a market) and three indicators (non-cash transfers through internet payment platforms, volume of payments in cryptocurrencies and parcels, which are tax free at the customs) are not enough in order to perform interpretations of economic results. Additionally, the data set should cover longer-term data, however the limitation appears due to relatively short existence of innovative financial products and the lack of information accumulation about necessary data in statistical databases.
This paper starts with describing some methods of teaching the history of malware and the response to adult learners visiting an online malware museum. We also discuss some of the methodologies and tools that a student can use to see live malware processes on his/her laptop while enrolled in a malware class. The paper also discusses how to learn more about the activity of the malware, methods to remove it, and some organizations that the student may join in order to network with corporate, academic, and law enforcement personnel to get the latest information on certain types of malware and their variants.
This work addresses the definition and identification of key elements of robustness and resilience in the context of sustainable digital investigation capacity. After a review of prior work, we describe the results of a structured questionnaire that was sent to 72 law enforcement agencies and subject-matter experts in both online and oral formats (app. response rate 29%). Based on an in-depth analysis of the feedback received, key elements for robustness and resilience of digital investigation capacity are identified and discussed at the strategic and operational levels, including Digital Forensics Strategy, Forensic Discipline, Standardisation, Continuous Education and Training, Research and Development, Co-operation, and Human Resources.

The advances of the ICT industry in recent years has led to huge popularity of Cloud Computing Services. Due to the fact that the Cloud is distributed and hosts numerous users, its use to commit crimes becomes a critical issue. Proactive cloud forensics becomes a matter of urgency: its capability to collect critical data before crimes happen, thus saving time and energy for the investigations is its primary objective. In this paper, we discuss the basis of Cloud Forensic Readiness, because we believe that such a system is of huge necessity. We begin by carefully defining Digital Forensic Readiness in the Cloud Computing context. We propose a reference architecture for a Cloud Forensic Readiness System (CFRS) together with its features, components, and challenges.
We propose in this paper a formal model for soft enforcement, where a decision-maker is influenced towards a decision, rather than forced to select that decision. This novel type of enforcement is particularly useful when the policy enforcer cannot fully control the environment of the decision-maker, as we illustrate in the context of attribute-based access control, by limiting the control over attributes. We also show that soft enforcement can improve the security of the system when the influencer is uncertain about the environment, and when neither forcing the decision-maker nor leaving them make their own selection is optimal. We define the general notion of optimal influencing policy, that takes into account both the control of the influencer and the uncertainty in the system.
This article reviews Braithwaite's recent work Crime as a Cascade Phenomenon and offers insights into its potential to transform criminological theory and practice. In his article Braithwaite argues that the cascade phenomenon is useful to understanding the spread of crime prevention interventions across time and space. The cascade concept is used as a framework to discuss the macro-level factors that affect action and inaction at the community level. Through an incorporation of self-efficacy and collective efficacy within the cascade framework Braithwaite argues that individuals and communities are the mediums through which crime and crime prevention flow. These mediums are also important factors in the sustenance and proliferation of crime prevention cascades, particularly when those cascades include elements of reintegrative approaches to the destigmatisation of criminal histories. Cascades of crime prevention and non-violence reach their greatest potential when collective efficacy is used to create socially positive rather than exclusionary practices.
Smart technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), are being adopted in cities and transforming them into smart cities. In smart cities, various network technologies, such as the Internet and IoT, are combined to exchange real-time information, making the everyday lives of their residents more convenient. However, there is a lack of systematic research on cybersecurity and cyber forensics in smart cities. This paper presents a comprehensive review and survey of cybersecurity and cyber forensics for smart cities. We analysed 154 papers that were published from 2015 to 2022 and proposed a new framework based on a decade of related research papers. We identified four major areas and eleven sub-areas for smart cities. We found that smart homes and the IoT were the most active research areas within the cybersecurity field. Additionally, we found that research on cyber forensics for smart cities was relatively limited compared to that on cybersecurity. Since 2020, there have been many studies on the IoT (which is a technological component of smart cities) that have utilized machine learning and deep learning. Due to the transmission of large-scale data through IoT devices in smart cities, ML and DL are expected to continue playing critical roles in smart city research.
"A significant percentage of security research that is conducted suffers from common issues that prevent wide-scale adoption. Common snags of such proposed methods tend to include (i) introduction of additional nodes within the communication architecture, breaking the simplicity of the typical client-server model, or fundamental restructuring of the Internet ecosystem; (ii) significant inflation of responsibilities or duties for the user and/or server operator; and (iii) adding increased risks surrounding sensitive data during the authentication process. Many schemes seek to prevent brute-forcing attacks; they often ignore either partially or holistically the dangers of other cyber-attacks such as MiTM or replay attacks. Therefore, there is no incentive to implement such proposals, and it has become the norm instead to inflate current username/password authentication systems. These have remained standard within client-server authentication paradigms, despite insecurities stemming from poor user and server operator practices, and vulnerabilities to interception and masquerades. Besides these vulnerabilities, systems which revolve around secure authentication typically present exploits of two categories; either pitfalls which allow MiTM or replay attacks due to transmitting data for authentication constantly, or the storage of sensitive information leading to highly specific methods of data storage or facilitation, increasing chances of human error. This paper proposes a more secure method of authentication that retains the current structure of accepted paradigms, but minimizes vulnerabilities which result from the process, and does not inflate responsibilities for users or server operators. The proposed scheme uses a hybrid, layered encryption technique alongside a two-part verification process, and provides dynamic protection against interception-based cyber-attacks such as replay or MiTM attacks, without creating additional vulnerabilities for other attacks such as bruteforcing. Results show the proposed mechanism outperforms not only standardized methods, but also other schemes in terms of deployability, exploit resilience, and speed."
"The purpose of this article is to report from a qualitative Scandinavian study with the aim of shedding some light on how investigators in the Scandinavian police services perceive the use of information from social media in investigative police work. Based on 12 group interviews and 49 informants from Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish police services, we present three overarching themes mirroring the general perception amongst the interviewed investigators that: (1) information from social media is valuable in almost all types of crime investigation; (2) the use of social media information is fraught with technical pitfalls resulting in a general fear of making mistakes; (3) the legal frameworks governing digital investigative action are vague, leading to a feeling amongst the investigators of working in a grey zone. Overall, the informants express the view that this seemingly unregulated part of investigative work requires a major overhaul."
Under Sitakeboge's Stress reaction and equilibrium recovery theory to Social distribution equilibrium failure, this paper proposes a host load balancing control model to each node based on Sitakeboge model under cloud computing. Based on CloudSim simulation software to Job scheduling algorithm under Sitakeboge model and Min-Min algorithm, the result approves the first algorithm is more Effectively guarantee the node load balancing than the next.
Several fields of digital forensics (i.e. file carving, memory forensics, network forensics) require the reliable data type classification of digital fragments. Up to now, a multitude of research papers proposing new classification approaches have been published. Within this paper we comprehensively review existing classification approaches and classify them into categories. For each category, approaches are grouped based on shared commonalities. The major contribution of this paper is a novel taxonomy of existing data fragment classification approaches. We highlight progress made by previous work facilitating the identification of future research directions. Furthermore, the taxonomy can provide the foundation for future knowledge-based classification approaches.
As more businesses and users adopt cloud computing services, security vulnerabilities will be increasingly found and exploited. There are many technological and political challenges where investigation of potentially criminal incidents in the cloud are concerned. Security experts, however, must still be able to acquire and analyze data in a methodical, rigorous and forensically sound manner. This work applies the STRIDE asset-based risk assessment method to cloud computing infrastructure for the purpose of identifying and assessing an organization's ability to respond to and investigate breaches in cloud computing environments. An extension to the STRIDE risk assessment model is proposed to help organizations quickly respond to incidents while ensuring acquisition and integrity of the largest amount of digital evidence possible. Further, the proposed model allows organizations to assess the needs and capacity of their incident responders before an incident occurs.
Article 2(4) of the UN Charter provides that nation-states will refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. It is doubtful whether it will deter states from waging war in cyberspace. Cyber warfare is a perplexing and contentious issue within the ambit of international law. Discussions have focused on whether the existing rules and principles may be extended to cyberspace or whether new treaty law on cyber warfare must be drafted. Against this background the International Group of Experts drafted the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence. The Tallinn Manual provides rules in respect of cyber warfare. In the absence of a multilateral treaty it may be asked whether the Tallinn Manual will achieve acceptance on a global level as rules governing cyber warfare.
With the increasing popularity of digital media and the ubiquitous availability of media editing software, innocuous multimedia are easily tampered for malicious purposes. Copy-move forgery is one important category of image forgery, in which a part of an image is duplicated, and substitutes another part of the same image at a different location. Many schemes have been proposed to detect and locate the forged regions. However, these schemes fail when the copied region is affected by post-processing operations before being pasted. To rectify the problem and further improve the detection accuracy, we propose a robust copy-move forgery detection method based on dual-transform to detect such specific artifacts, in which a cascade of Radon transform (RT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used. It will be shown that the dual-transform coefficients well conform the efficient assumption and therefore leads to more robust feature extraction results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is robust not only to noise contamination, blurring, and JPEG compression, but also to region scaling, rotation and flipping, respectively.
The recovery of deleted files is an important task frequently carried out by professionals in digital forensics and data recovery. When carried out without information from the file system, this process is called file carving. The techniques implemented in today's file carvers are mostly sufficient for non-fragmented files. Fragmented files, on the contrary, are not well supported. In this paper we present a general process model for the recovery of fragmented files. This model is then applied to the JPEG file format which is the de facto standard for digital photographs. Moreover, we evaluate popular open source carvers and compare them with our proposed approach.
"Lawful interception has evolved over the past decades from the target based monitoring and interception of telecomm conversations, to the monitoring and interception of packet switched communications. The lawful monitoring and interception of both telecomm and packet switched communications is regulated by law enforcement agencies, with the cooperation, under the Lawful Interception regulation and legislation, of the service providers. Social networks are also a means of communicating; but the nature of communication therein is extremely more complex, as it allows both for linear communication (one to one) and broadcasting of information (one to many/ crowd) to selected groups and communities. Social networks are a haven for criminals and insurgents. The open nature of the media provides criminals with ample access to potential victims and provides insurgents with a virtual Hyde Park, where they can openly voice their opinions, gain followers and instigate and organize disruptive activities. The nature of the communication within social networks, the ease of establishing fake identities therein, the fact that the client-server communication can be encrypted, and the huge amount of data that passes through these networks on a daily basis - however, are far from law-enforcement friendly. Furthermore, the fact that social networks are operated by commercial, usually foreign based, companies, which do not necessarily adhere to the local Lawful Interception legislation and regulation, increases the challenge of monitoring of communication with social media. The paper will discuss the technological challenges that law-enforcement agencies face when trying to monitor social networks, and the technological, regulatory and legislative provisions that can and should be put in place, by the operators of the Social Network Services and local law enforcement agencies, in order to prevent social network services from continuing to foster criminals and insurgents."
In order to efficiently manage and operate industrial-level production, an increasing number of industrial devices and critical infrastructure (CI) are now connected to the internet, exposed to malicious hackers and cyberterrorists who aim to cause significant damage to institutions and countries. Throughout the various stages of a cyber-attack, Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) tools could gather data from various publicly available platforms, and thus help hackers identify vulnerabilities and develop malware and attack strategies against targeted CI sectors. The purpose of the current study is to explore and identify the types of OSINT data that are useful for malicious individuals intending to conduct cyber-attacks against the CI industry. Applying and searching keyword queries in four open-source surface web platforms (Google, YouTube, Reddit, and Shodan), search results published between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed and qualitatively analyzed to categorize CI information that could be useful to hackers. Over 4000 results were analyzed from the open-source websites, 250 of which were found to provide information related to hacking and/or cybersecurity of CI facilities to malicious actors. Using thematic content analysis, we identified three major types of data malicious attackers could retrieve using OSINT tools: indirect reconnaissance data, proof-of-concept codes, and educational materials. The thematic results from this study reveal an increasing amount of open-source information useful for malicious attackers against industrial devices, as well as the need for programs, training, and policies required to protect and secure industrial systems and CI.
While a growing body of evidence suggests that the Internet is a key facilitator of violent extremism, research in this area has rarely incorporated former extremists' experiences with the Internet when they were involved in violent extremism. To address this gap, in-depth interviews were conducted with ten Canadian former right-wing extremists who were involved in violent racist skinhead groups, with interview questions provided by thirty Canadian law enforcement officials and ten community activists. Participants were asked about their use of the Internet and the connection between their on- and offline worlds during their involvement in the violent right-wing extremist movement. Overall, our study findings highlight the interplay between the Internet and violent extremism as well as the interactions between the on- and offline worlds of violent extremists. We conclude with a discussion of study limitations and avenues for future research.
A significant, and likely dominant, proportion of fraud is now conducted online. Police struggle to integrate this emerging reality into their processes, while expectations of this institution are high. These types of cybercrimes alter the volume and complexity of problems compared to how they previously manifested and require profound transformations of crime analysis methods to address them proactively. These developments face many difficulties, such as the quality of accessible data, the lack of existing analytical models and the need to increase police knowledge of fraud mechanisms within every level of organisations. We suggest methods to overcome these obstacles, which consist of implementing an approach integrating theories from various fields in criminology and forensic intelligence to examine the digital transformations of certain criminal processes. We take, as an example, how a generic script expressing the anatomy of an existing type of fraud can be used to interpret their new digital forms. This modelling activity both provides new insight into specific frauds and highlights relevant dimensions that are useful in orienting the development of crime analysis systems.
Handling forensic investigations gets more and more difficult as the amount of data one has to analyze is increasing continuously. A common approach for automated file identification are hash functions. The proceeding is quite simple: a tool hashes all files of a seized device and compares them against a database. Depending on the database, this allows to discard non-relevant (whitelisting) or detect suspicious files (blacklisting). One can distinguish three kinds of algorithms: (cryptographic) hash functions, bytewise approximate matching and semantic approximate matching (a. k. a perceptual hashing) where the main difference is the operation level. The latter one operates on the semantic level while both other approaches consider the byte-level. Hence, investigators have three different approaches at hand to analyze a device. First, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of existing approaches for bytewise and semantic approximate matching (for semantic we focus on images functions). Second, we compare implementations and summarize the strengths and weaknesses of all approaches. Third, we show how to integrate these functions based on a sample use case into one existing process model, the computer forensics field triage process model.
"eCrime is now the typical volume property crime in the United Kingdom impacting more of the public than traditional acquisitive crimes such as burglary and car theft (Anderson et al, 2012). It has become increasingly central to the National Security Strategy of several countries; in the United Kingdom becoming a Tier One threat. While it is apparent to some governments that cybercrimes are now as much of a 'problem' as some forms of organised crime, little is known about the perceptions of the broad network of what we call public and private sector 'eCrime controllers' in the United Kingdom. A survey of 104 members of the UK Information Assurance community garnered data on the perceptions of the eCrime problem. The results showed an association of cooperation and consumption of data sources with perceptions. It is likely that perceptions within non-specialist corporate and public domains (non-IT and Finance) will begin to change as new cooperation arrangements are introduced as part of the UK Cyber Security Strategy. These findings call for a more in-depth qualitative understanding of the cooperation between eCrime controllers and their data consumption practices. Ascertaining what shapes this cooperation (and non-cooperation) and how perceptions compare with 'actual' threats and risks is necessary if we are to better understand the 'social construction' of the problem and subsequent policy and operational outcomes."
There is increasing enthusiasm for, and recognition of, the benefits that artificial intelligence (AI) can provide to society. The emphasis has been on the positive, but AI and deep learning can be used for negative purposes. Modular Neural Networks (MNN) are capable of independent learning and have been targeted at evolutionary, complex financial systems. If the goal of an MNN were to be defined as system penetration, there is no reason why an algorithm could not run in the background. There are a resource requirements, but organised crime groups, technology companies, nation states and individuals with a curious bent are all capable of such. Ordered society and security requires a degree of certainty that systems on which society depends will remain recognisable, dependable and resilient. Under current conditions, security is difficult enough. It is suggested that limitations may be required before release of certain AI systems, in the knowledge of their potential for detriment to society. An AI system capable of independent learning, permits undefined emergent behaviours. That the results of any emergent properties may be benign or malign is irrelevant. Scientific history is littered with developments whose uses were redirected away from the benign.Such concern could be interpreted as fear of the unknown, standing in the way of technological advances. Unless society wishes to become machine-driven, the power and control of systems should be defined and limited by society, not accidently sprung on humanity or based on a ruthless logic that may drive a system to an unacceptable conclusion. Currently there are sophisticated botnet forming methods ensuring botnet persistence. If combined with the concepts of AI, there is a possibility that botnets could exist in perpetuity, with no one able to predict emergence, and no time limits on evolution. Whither cyber defence in the face of the unstoppable, increasingly intelligent, goal directed systems?
Cybersecurity adopts data mining for its ability to extract concealed and indistinct patterns in the data, such as for the needs of alert correlation. Inferring common attack patterns and rules from the alerts helps in understanding the threat landscape for the defenders and allows for the realization of cyber situational awareness, including the projection of ongoing attacks. In this article, we explore the use of data mining, namely sequential rule mining, in the analysis of intrusion detection alerts. We employed a dataset of 12 million alerts from 34 intrusion detection systems in 3 organizations gathered in an alert sharing platform, and processed it using our analytical framework. We execute the mining of sequential rules that we use to predict security events, which we utilize to create a predictive blacklist. Thus, the recipients of the data from the sharing platform will receive only a small number of alerts of events that are likely to occur instead of a large number of alerts of past events. The predictive blacklist has the size of only 3% of the raw data, and more than 60% of its entries are shown to be successful in performing accurate predictions in operational, real-world settings.
For digital forensics, eliminating the uninteresting is often more critical than finding the interesting. We define uninteresting as containing no useful information about users of a drive, a definition which applies to most criminal investigations. Matching file hash values to those in published hash sets is the standard method, but these sets have limited coverage. This work compared nine automated methods of finding additional uninteresting files: (1) frequent hash values, (2) frequent paths, (3) frequent filename-directory pairs, (4) unusually busy times for a drive, (5) unusually busy weeks for a corpus, (6) unusually frequent file sizes, (7) membership in directories containing mostly-known files, (8) known uninteresting directories, and (9) uninteresting extensions. Tests were run on an international corpus of 83.8 million files, and after removing the 25.1 % of files with hash values in the National Software Reference Library, an additional 54.7 % were eliminated that matched two of our nine criteria, few of whose hash values were in two commercial hash sets. False negatives were estimated at 0.1 % and false positives at 19.0 %. We confirmed the generality of our methods by showing a good correlation between results obtained separately on two halves of our corpus. This work provides two kinds of results: 8.4 million hash values of uninteresting files in our own corpus, and programs for finding uninteresting files on new corpora.
This work presents a method for the measurement of the accuracy of evidential artifact extraction and categorization tasks in digital forensic investigations. Instead of focusing on the measurement of accuracy and errors in the functions of digital forensic tools, this work proposes the application of information retrieval measurement techniques that allow the incorporation of errors introduced by tools and analysis processes. This method uses a 'gold standard' that is the collection of evidential objects determined by a digital investigator from suspect data with an unknown ground truth. This work proposes that the accuracy of tools and investigation processes can be evaluated compared to the derived gold standard using common precision and recall values. Two example case studies are presented showing the measurement of the accuracy of automated analysis tools as compared to an in-depth analysis by an expert. It is shown that such measurement can allow investigators to determine changes in accuracy of their processes over time, and determine if such a change is caused by their tools or knowledge.
New versions of Windows come equipped with mechanisms, such as EFS and BitLocker, which are capable of encrypting data to an industrial standard on a Personal Computer. This creates problems if the computer in question contains electronic evidence. BitLocker, for instance, provides a secure way for an individual to hide the contents of their entire disk, but as with most technologies, there are bound to be weaknesses and threats to the security of the encrypted data. It is conceivable that this technology, while appearing robust and secure, may contain flaws, which would jeopardize the integrity of the whole system. As more people encrypt their hard drives, it will become harder and harder for forensic investigators to recover data from Personal Computers. This paper documents the Bitlocker Drive Encryption System (version 2) in Windows 7. In particular it describes how to forensically decrypt and load a FAT disk or image which is bitlocked, if the keys are provided.
"This research presents two developed approaches for the forensic acquisition of an Amazon Kindle Fire HD. It describes the forensic acquisition and analysis of the Amazon Kindle Fire HD device. Two developed methods of acquisition are presented; one requiring a special cable to reflash the boot partition of the device with a forensic acquisition environment (Method A), and the other exploiting a vulnerability in the device's Android operating system (Method B). A case study is then presented showing the various digital evidence that can be extracted from the device. The results indicate that Method A is more favorable because it utilizes a general methodology that does not exploit a vulnerability that could potentially be patched by Amazon in future software updates."
Image conversion of malicious binaries, or binary visualisation, is a relevant approach in the security community. Recently, it has exceeded the role of a single-file malware analysis tool and has become a part of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) thanks to the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, there has been little effort toward image segmentation for the converted images. In this study, we propose a novel method that serves a dual purpose: (a) it enhances colour and pattern segmentation, and (b) it achieves a sparse representation of the images. According to this, we considered the R, G, and B colour values of each pixel as respective fuzzy sets. We then performed a-cuts as a defuzzification method across all pixels of the image, which converted them to sparse matrices of 0s and 1s. Our method was tested on a variety of dataset sizes and evaluated according to the detection rates of hyperparameterised ResNet50 models. Our findings demonstrated that for larger datasets, sparse representations of intelligently coloured binary images can exceed the model performance of unprocessed ones, with 93.60% accuracy, 94.48% precision, 92.60% recall, and 93.53% f-score. This is the first time that a-cuts were used in image processing and according to our results, we believe that they provide an important contribution to image processing for challenging datasets. Overall, it shows that it can become an integrated component of image-based IDS operations and other demanding real-time practices.
It remains unknown if taking commonly used preventive actions is related to identity theft. In the current study, we use a dataset featuring over 220,000 respondents to the National Crime Victimization Survey Identity Theft Supplement (NCVS ITS). The survey was conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) first in 2012, then again in 2014, and once more in 2016. The findings reported here suggest that demographic variables (e.g., gender, income) and types of online activities (e.g., frequency of online shopping) are significantly related to identity theft victimization. An interesting additional finding is that among seven distinct types of preventive actions listed in the NCVS ITS survey (frequently checking credit reports, frequently changing passwords for financial accounts, employing purchase credit monitoring, shredding documents containing personal information, monitoring bank statements for suspect charges, using security software programs, and purchasing identity theft protection), shredding documents with personal information ALONE is significantly negatively related to identity theft victimization. All six other preventive actions are either positively related or unrelated to identity theft victimization. These findings generate practical implications and, most importantly, raise the question of whether some newly-fashioned preventive actions might provide better protection from identity theft protection.
Ordered society and nation states are dependent on interconnected systems, the defence of which is largely in private hands whose actions are driven by need for oligopolistic market dominance, protection of assets, and their monetisation models. This paper queries the responsibility of the nation state for the protection of itself and its citizenry. By some definitions, corporations are conducting cyberwarfare and, in cyberspace, are virtual nation states with ownership and rights over the data they hold and the intelligence it yields. The financial challenge for market dominance could drive an internecine war among the major technology corporations, and an assertion that the rights over the data they control are superior to those of the nation state. As functional monopolists, data they have acquired is not available from any other source. The intelligence from analytics exercised over that data, and the data itself is proprietary. These corporations exercise monopolist characteristics in the areas of data, information and intelligence. The aggregate value of the top 5 technology corporations, colloquially known as Big Tech is equivalent to third in projected global GDP rankings for 2021. This represents an equivalent expression of power in/over cyberspace. Cloud service providers (CSP) are often offshoots of Big Tech and have a high compound annual growth rate, thereby revealing the motivation for protection of market dominance and potential threat to user/customers. By concentrating on traditional cyber warfare and defence, there is limited consideration on policing or guarding against the rise of these virtual supranational powers driven by strict market agenda. What consideration there is regarding potential threats is driven by an economic perspective and anti-trust initiatives. Whether judged by the nation state as benign or malign, Big Tech has an impact on the nature and direction of society as currently understood and the question must be raised whether both citizens, organisations, and states need protection from it.
Security is a key challenge in the deployment and broader acceptance of cloud computing services, and existing research efforts include evaluating the effectiveness of various security solutions such as security policy implementations and technological solutions. Attacks on cloud environment may be considered from the criminological perspective, and crime theories be used to protect the cloud. This paper introduces a conceptual cloud security model utilizing the concept of situational crime prevention (SCP). Using SCP techniques, it may be possible to design process and technology-based steps to modifying the cloud computing environment to make it less attractive to crime.
An extensive study of the current practice of online payment using credit and debit cards reveals the intrinsic security challenges caused by differences in how payment sites operate.
This paper explores some of the key barriers to Open Government Data (OGD) that responsible civil servants in the UK face as they try to comply with the UK-led OGD initiative. Empirically, we provide a quantitative analysis of the resources published on the government's central OGD portal, data.gov.uk, and a unique insight into the publishing of OGD in the UK based on 22 interviews with responsible individuals at the operational level of publishing OGD. Our findings reveal that while the barriers to open government information have been substantially reduced, the barriers to open government data persist. Even the most enthusiastic responsible individuals face considerable obstacles in publishing OGD. Further, a key barrier to OGD in the UK is its impression management strategy based on its informational rather than data orientation. Due to the UK's pioneering position in the OGD initiative, these findings are relevant to understanding and improving OGD programmes at local, national and international levels. The findings may subsequently lead to evidence-based strategies and policies.
This edited volume celebrates the significant contributions of Peter Grabosky to the field of Criminology, and in particular, his work developing and adapting regulatory theory to the study of policing and security. Over the past three decades, his path-breaking theoretical and empirical research has contributed to a burgeoning literature on the myriad ways regulatory systems drive state and non-state interactions in an effort to control crime. This collection of essays showcase Grabosky's pioneering treatment of key regulatory concepts as they relate to such interactions, and illustrate how his work has been instrumental in shaping contemporary scholarship and practice around the governance of security.
This study provides a snapshot of the availability of weapons across eight omnibus or 'High Street' and 12 specialist darknet or illicit cryptomarkets between July and December 2019. Overall, 2,124 weapons were identified, of which 11 percent were found on niche markets. On all markets, weapons for sale included 1,497 handguns, 218 rifles, 41 submachine guns and 34 shotguns. Also available were ammunition (n=79), explosives (n=37) and accessories such as silencers (n=24). Omnibus markets also sold other weapons (n=70) such as tasers, pepper spray and knives, and digital products (n=112), mostly DIY weapon manuals, as well as chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological weapons (n=12). The data allowed for estimates of the cost of weapons and some description of the 215 vendors identified, 18 (8.4%) of whom were active across more than one market.
"This study sheds light on the match-fixing ecosystem, with particular focus on those entities engaged in protecting the integrity of competitions. It analyzes the characteristics of match-fixers, as perceived by some anti-match-fixing stakeholders; the known processes of match-fixing and their evolution; and the interactions among stakeholders in the match-fixing ecosystem. Results show that while anti-match-fixing actors seem to have only a fuzzy idea of match-fixers' characteristics, they appear to know quite well how fraudsters manipulate games. Meanwhile, fixers seem to have adapted their processes across time in response to harsher countermeasures according to two main strategies: layering, in which mules are used to place bets on multiple operators to conceal suspicious betting pattern algorithms, and diversification/displacement, in which fixers decide to pursue new betting options or to target minor leagues or other, less monitored sports. Some fixers did not have to adapt since in many countries police investigations remain rare and criminal sanction mild. Further research should encourage comparative perspectives beyond the European dimension, develop a more systematic effort to establish a sport fraudsters typology, and focus on non-betting-related sports manipulations."
"The Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced constant growth in the number of devices deployed and the range of applications in which such devices are used. They vary widely in size, computational power, capacity storage, and energy. The explosive growth and integration of IoT in different domains and areas of our daily lives has created an Internet of Vulnerabilities (IoV). In the rush to build and implement IoT devices, security and privacy have not been adequately addressed. IoT devices, many of which are highly constrained, are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which threaten the security and privacy of users and systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of IoT in regard to areas of application, security architecture frameworks, recent security and privacy issues in IoT, as well as a review of recent similar studies on IoT security and privacy. In addition, the paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks on IoT based on the three-layer architecture model; perception, network, and application layers, as well as a suggestion of the impact of these attacks on CIA objectives in representative devices, are presented. Moreover, the study proposes mitigations and countermeasures, taking a multi-faceted approach rather than a per layer approach. Open research areas are also covered to provide researchers with the most recent research urgent questions in regard to securing IoT ecosystem."
In this paper, we propose a generic specification framework for argumentation dialogue protocols in an open multi-agent system. The specification framework is based on reusable elements - dialogue templates - which are realized as an open-source implementation. We provide operational semantics and show formally how templates can be used to determine the possible dialogues. Furthermore, for open multi-agent systems we need to be able to specify peer-to-peer dialogues, where the agents themselves are in a position to know whether their dialogue actions are legal according to the protocol without relying on central entities, institutes or middleware. We prove that all protocols that can be specified in our framework are peer-to-peer suitable.
In cyber security education, hands-on training is a common type of exercise to help raise awareness and competence, and improve students' cybersecurity skills. To be able to measure the impact of the design of the particular courses, the designers need methods that can reveal hidden patterns in trainee behavior. However, the support of the designers in performing such analytic and evaluation tasks is ad-hoc and insufficient. With unsupervised machine learning methods, we designed a tool for clustering the trainee actions that can exhibit their strategies or help pinpoint flaws in the training design. By using a k-means++ algorithm, we explore clusters of trainees that unveil their specific behavior within the training sessions. The final visualization tool consists of views with scatter plots and radar charts. The former provides a two-dimensional correlation of selected trainee actions and displays their clusters. In contrast, the radar chart displays distinct clusters of trainees based on their more specific strategies or approaches when solving tasks. Through iterative training redesign, the tool can help designers identify improper training parameters and improve the quality of the courses accordingly. To evaluate the tool, we performed a qualitative evaluation of its outcomes with cybersecurity experts. The results confirm the usability of the selected methods in discovering significant trainee behavior. Our insights and recommendations can be beneficial for the design of tools for educators, even beyond cyber security.
"Criminal activities are widely facilitated by online means; so are sex crimes. Online dating, also referred to as e-dating, enables people to get in touch with potential romantic partners through digital means. Unfortunately, sex criminals also exploit online dating platforms to find victims. Several e-dating applications have been developed for computers and mobile phones, but few, if any, efforts have focused on retrieving evidence from e-dating applications. This chapter describes forensic methods for retrieving evidence from two popular e-dating applications - Tinder and Coffee Meets Bagel - by examining iPhone backups created via iTunes on Windows and Macintosh personal computers."
PurposeThis paper presents a qualitative study of penetration testing, the practice of attacking information systems to find security vulnerabilities and fixing them. The purpose of this paper is to understand whether and to what extent penetration testing can reveal various socio-organisational factors of information security in organisations. In doing so, the paper innovates theory by using Routine Activity Theory together with phenomenology of information systems concepts.Design/methodology/approachThe articulation of Routine Activity Theory and phenomenology emerged inductively from the data analysis. The data consists of 24 qualitative interviews conducted with penetration testers, analysed with thematic analysis.FindingsThe starting assumption is that penetration testers are akin to offenders in a crime situation, dealing with targets and the absence of capable guardians. A key finding is that penetration testers described their targets as an installed base, highlighting how vulnerabilities, which make a target suitable, often emerge from properties of the existing built digital environments. This includes systems that are forgotten or lack ongoing maintenance. Moreover, penetration testers highlighted that although the testing is often predicated on planned methodologies, often they resort to serendipitous practices such as improvisation.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to theory, showing how Routine Activity Theory and phenomenological concepts can work together in the study of socio-organisational factors of information security. This contribution stems from considering that much research on information security focuses on the internal actions of organisations. The study of penetration testing as a proxy of real attacks allows novel insights into socio-organisational factors of information security in organisations.
Relation extraction from text is a well-known and extensively studied topic in Natural Language Processing research. However, the implementation of relation extraction approaches in real-world application scenarios raises various methodological considerations which are often left implicit in existing research. This paper explores these considerations using a real-world dataset of user-generated police reports in Dutch. The use of linguistic features based on dependency trees is investigated, including an ablation analysis of the importance of individual features. The construction of negative examples for machine learning models is discussed, as well as the construction of a baseline model. The methodological implications of using a small dataset are discussed in terms of the design and performance of a Long Short Term Memory network as well as a Support Vector Machine. In general the models perform well, however the definition of the classification task, and in particular the construction of negative examples, are shown to have a large impact on classification accuracy and subsequently on the interpretation of the evaluation results.
Understanding commuting behavior among socioeconomic groups is essential in promoting equity across the housing and transportation system. This field is well-studied, but existing research failed to reach a complete agreement on the relationship between socioeconomic groups and commuting distance. Our study establishes a framework to model distance deterrence impacts on various socio-economic groups of commuters by adapting a commonly used gravity model approach. We apply this framework to explore commuting distance on income groups in 12 major U.S cities, delineate how the deterrence impact increases with distance, and demonstrate a significant discrepancy in it between the low- and high-income groups. Results indicate that high-income commuters are less sensitive to increasing distance. And this inequity is more severe in cities that have higher population density and more clustered job locations. Our findings provide insights for equity analysis in public transit infrastructures and land use.
The vast increase in the use of social networks and other internet-based communication tools contributed to the escalation of the problem of exchanging child pornographic material over the internet. The problem of dissemination of child pornographic material could be addressed using dedicated image detection algorithms capable of rating the inappropriateness level of images exchanged through computer networks so that images with inappropriate content involving children are blocked. However, the complexity of the image detection task coupled with the nonexistence of suitable datasets, inhibit the development of efficient algorithms that can be used for detecting offensive images containing children. To deal with the problem, we propose a methodological approach that can be used for supporting the development of child pornography detectors through the generation of synthetic datasets and through the decomposition of the task into a set of simpler tasks for which training data is available. Preliminary results show the promise of the proposed approach.
The combined success of social networking sites and smartphones has changed the way people communicate. It is now possible to publish and track contents in real time at any time and from anywhere. The large number of users on social platforms constitutes an unprecedented opportunity for attack for malicious users. Social engineering techniques, spammers, phishing and malicious attacks are examples of threats that can lead to data loss, data theft, identity theft, etc. The detection of suspicious messages or profiles is mainly covered in the literature as a binary and static classification problem. In this paper, we propose a dynamic behavioral framework for identifying suspicious profiles on social networking sites. This approach is based on three indicators: balance, energy and anomaly, synthesized from daily activities of users. We demonstrate that sensing users regularly, even on few indicators, enables suspicious behaviour to be predicted with a high level of accuracy. The low calculation costs of the approach makes it embeddable into smartphones of social networking users for inferring trust scores to their contacts.
A snapshot of the sale of fentanyl and its analogues across several popular darknet markets between 2 January and 27 March 2019 reveals the amount, types and physical forms available. Of the 127,541 unique drug listings identified, 13,135 were opioids (10.3% of all drugs), of which 1,118 (0.876% of all drugs) were fentanyl or its analogues. Between 27.3 and 39.3 kilograms of fentanyl and its derivatives were available over the period. The average price of fentanyl was A$99 per gram, while carfentanil was A$26.8 per gram. The shipping methods, cross-market operations and product specialisation of the 303 active fentanyl vendors on these darknet markets are also described.
"Utilizing interviews with 42 current and ex-street offenders, this study explores the relationship between street gang organization and robbery. Robbery type is affected by level of organization exhibited by the gang. For recreational and territorial young street gangs, robbery is opportunistic, occurring in a diffuse manner, and conducted individually, even when others are present as backup'. For criminal gangs, robbery is often planned in advance with proceeds of crime divided more evenly amongst group members. Serious Organized Crime gangs are typically more specialized; thus, robbery may often be the gang's main occupation'. For organized crime groups, robbery most often occurs in the illegitimate market, but can be aimed at legitimate and highly profitable institutions. We make sense of these findings with reference to street capital theory and present implications for future research and practice."
Choosing an optimal investment in information security is an issue most companies face these days. Which security controls to buy to protect the IT system of a company in the best way? Selecting a subset of security controls among many available ones can be seen as a resource allocation problem that should take into account conflicting objectives and constraints of the problem. In particular, the security of the system should be improved without hindering productivity, under a limited budget for buying controls. In this work, we provide several possible formulations of security controls subset selection problem as a portfolio optimization, which is well known in financial management. We propose approaches to solve them using existing single and multiobjective optimization algorithms. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
In this work, a new approach to selection in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is proposed. It is based on the portfolio selection problem, which is well known in financial management. The idea of optimizing a portfolio of investments according to both expected return and risk is transferred to evolutionary selection, and fitness assignment is reinterpreted as the allocation of capital to the individuals in the population, while taking into account both individual quality and population diversity. The resulting selection procedure, which unifies parental and environmental selection, is instantiated by defining a suitable notion of (random) return for multiobjective optimization. Preliminary experiments on multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem instances show that such a procedure is able to preserve diversity while promoting convergence towards the Pareto-optimal front.
Online users continuously come across privacy policies for the service they use. Due to the complexity and verbosity of policies, majority of the users skip the tedious task of reading the policy and accept it. Without reading and evaluating the document users risk giving up all kinds of rights to their personal data and for the most part, are unaware of the data sharing and handling process. Efforts have been made to address the complex and lengthy structure of privacy policies by creating a standardized machine-readable format of privacy policies for the web browsers to process it automatically, a repository of crowdsourced summarized versions of some privacy policies, or by using natural language processing to summarize the policies. PirvacyInterpreter is one unique tool that acknowledges human-centric factors while summarising the policy. Thus, it generates a personalised summary of the privacy policy for the user providing relevant information to appease their privacy concerns. This paper presents the conceptualization of PrivacyInterpreter and implements a proof-of-concept model using configured RoBERTa(base) model to classify a privacy policy and produce a summary based on privacy aspects that reflect users' privacy concerns.
"The 40th Anniversary Edition of Taylor, Walton and Young's New Criminology, published in 2013, opened with these words: 'The New Criminology was written at a particular time and place, it was a product of 1968 and its aftermath; a world turned upside down'. We are at a similar moment today. Several developments have been, and are turning, our 21st century world upside down. Among the most profound has been the emergence of a new earth, that the 'Anthropocene' references, and 'cyberspace', a term first used in the 1960s, which James Lovelock has recently termed a 'Novacene', a world that includes both human and artificial intelligences. We live today on an earth that is proving to be very different to the Holocene earth, our home for the past 12,000years. To appreciate the Novacene one need only think of our 'smart' phones. This world constitutes a novel domain of existence that Castells has conceived of as a terrain of 'material arrangements that allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity' - a world of sprawling material infrastructures, that has enabled a 'space of flows', through which massive amounts of information travel. Like the Anthropocene, the Novacene has brought with it novel 'harmscapes', for example, attacks on energy systems. In this paper, we consider how criminology has responded to these harmscapes brought on by these new worlds. We identify 'lines of flight' that are emerging, as these challenges are being met by criminological thinkers who are developing the conceptual trajectories that are shaping 21st century criminologies."
This study examined the feasibility of routine activity theory in predicting online harassment victimization of people aged 15 to 30 years in the USA, Finland, Germany, and the UK. Logistic regression models controlled for socio-demographic factors, exposure to offender, target suitability, and absence of guardianship. According to the results, between 15 percent and 20 percent of respondents reported having been victims of online harassment. Of routine activity theory variables tested, only exposure to offenders was statistically significant in each of the four countries. Females were more likely to be victims than males in Finland, but not in other countries. Those with an immigrant background had a higher likelihood of being victims in Germany, but not in the other countries, whereas the protective role of guardianship was supported in the USA and Germany. Our findings indicate that while routine activity theory is a useful tool for predicting online victimization, its feasibility varied across countries.
"Since the inception of the World Wide Web, security agencies, researchers, and analysts have focused much of their attention on the sentiment found on hate-inspired web-forums. Here, one of their goals has been to detect and measure users' affects that are expressed in the forums as well as identify how users' affects change over time. Manual inspection has been one way to do this; however, as the number of discussion posts and sub-forums increase, there has been a growing need for an automated system that can assist humans in their analysis. The aim of this paper, then, is to detect and measure a number of affects expressed in written text on Stormfront. org, the most visited hate forum on the Web. To do this, we used a machine learning approach where we trained a model to recognize affects on three sub-forums: Ideology and Philosophy, For Stormfront Ladies Only, and Stormfront Ireland. The training data consisted of manual annotated data and the affects we focused on were racism, aggression, and worries. Results indicate that even though measuring affects is a subjective process, machine learning is a promising way forward to analyze and measure the presence of different affects on hate forums."
Honeypots have been a key tool in controlling and understanding digital crime for several decades. The tool has traditionally been deployed against actors who are attempting to hack into systems or as a discovery mechanism for new forms of malware. This paper presents a novel approach to using a honeypot architecture in conjunction with social networks to respond to non-technical digital crimes. The tool is presented within the context of Child Exploitation Material (CEM), and to support the goal of taking an educative approach to Internet users who are developing an interest in this material. The architecture that is presented in the paper includes multiple layers, including recruitment, obfuscation, and education. The approach does not aim to collect data to support punitive action, but to educate users, increasing their knowledge and awareness of the negative impacts of such material.
In many applications of forensic image analysis, state-of-the-art results are nowadays achieved with machine learning methods. However, concerns about their reliability and opacity raise the question whether such methods can be used in criminal investigations. So far, this question of legal compliance has hardly been discussed, also because legal regulations for machine learning methods were not defined explicitly. To this end, the European Commission recently proposed the artificial intelligence (AI) act, a regulatory framework for the trustworthy use of AI. Under the draft AI act, high-risk AI systems for use in law enforcement are permitted but subject to compliance with mandatory requirements. In this paper, we review why the use of machine learning in forensic image analysis is classified as high-risk. We then summarize the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems and discuss these requirements in light of two forensic applications, license plate recognition and deep fake detection. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the upcoming legal requirements and to point out avenues for future research.
With the increasing complexity of software permeating critical domains such as autonomous driving, new challenges are emerging in the ways the engineering of these systems needs to be rethought. Autonomous driving is expected to continue gradually overtaking all critical driving functions, which is adding to the complexity of the certification of autonomous driving systems. As a response, certification authorities have already started introducing strategies for the certification of autonomous vehicles and their software. But even with these new approaches, the certification procedures are not fully catching up with the dynamism and unpredictability of future autonomous systems, and thus may not necessarily guarantee compliance with all requirements imposed on these systems. In this paper, we identified a number of issues with the proposed certification strategies, which may impact the systems substantially. For instance, we emphasize the lack of adequate reflection on software changes occurring in constantly changing systems, or low support for systems' cooperation needed for the management of coordinated moves. Other shortcomings concern the narrow focus of the awarded certification by neglecting aspects such as the ethical behaviour of autonomous software systems. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the motivation for the need to modify the current certification processes for autonomous driving systems. Second, we analyze current international standards used in the certification processes towards requirements derived from the requirements laid on dynamic software ecosystems and autonomous systems themselves. Third, we outline a concept for incorporating the missing parts into the certification procedure.
While Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is developed to enable effective vehicle communication and traffic information exchange, VANET is also vulnerable to different security attacks, such as DOS attacks. The usage of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is one possible solution for preventing attacks in VANET. However, dealing with a large amount of vehicular data that keep growing in the urban environment is still an critical challenge for IDSs. This paper, therefore, proposes a new machine learning model to improve the performance of IDSs by using Random Forest and a posterior detection based on coresets to improve the detection accuracy and increase detection efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed machine learning model can significantly enhance the detection accuracy compared to classical application of machine learning models.
With the advent of state-of-the-art models based on Neural Networks, the need for vast corpora of accurately labeled data has become fundamental. However, building such datasets is a very resource-consuming task that additionally requires domain expertise. The present work seeks to alleviate this limitation by proposing an interactive semi-automatic annotation tool using an incremental learning approach to reduce human effort. The automatic models used to assist the annotation are incrementally improved based on user corrections to better annotate the next data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we build a dataset with named entities and relations between them related to the crime field with the help of the tool. Analysis results show that annotation effort is considerably reduced while still maintaining the annotation quality compared to fully manual labeling.
This study explores the internal dynamics and networks of terrorist groups in cyberspace-in particular, Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Using a Global Cyberterrorism Dataset that features data on cyberterror attacks between 2011 and 2016, this research analyzes these two terrorist groups through the lens of a cyber-conflict theory that integrates conflict theory with Jaishankar's space transition theory. Through a network analysis methodology, we examine the invisible relationships and connections between the national origins and target countries of cyberterror attacks. The analysis focuses on the networks of national origins of terrorists and victims, network structures of Al-Qaeda and ISIS actors, and clustering networks of Al-Qaeda and ISIS cyberterrorists. Results indicate that terror in cyberspace is ubiquitous, more flexible than traditional terrorism, and that cyberattacks mostly occurred within the countries of origin. We conclude by discussing the complex features of cyberterror networks and identify some of the geostrategic implications of the divergent cyber strategies adopted by Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
"The subject of the study is the state and prospects of development of legal and economic foundations of regulation of legal relations in the sphere of national security of Ukraine. Methodology. In the process of research were used general scientific and special legal methods. Dialectical method made it possible to compare the level of legal protection of private and public interests as a type of national interests in comparison with the objects of national security. By means of analysis were determined quantitative and qualitative parameters of measures implemented within the framework of ensuring national security of Ukraine in the sphere of protected national interests of legal and economic nature. Synthesis provided the formation of common features that mediate the existence of the main categories in the sphere of national security, taking into account the time period in which the relevant measures are implemented. Comparative-legal method allowed us to identify common and distinctive features in the implementation of measures of legal and economic nature to ensure national security at different times and in the future. The purpose of the article is to establish the state and determine the prospects of development of legal and economic provision of regulation of social relations in the sphere of national security, taking into account geopolitical and internal challenges of the corresponding period of the existence of Ukrainian statehood. The results of the study showed that the state of legal and economic security of national security of Ukraine needs to be adjusted and improved taking into account the needs of the time in the geopolitical space, which is reflected in the organizational, legal and legislative work of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the research of scientists. Conclusion. The legal and economic foundations of Ukraine's national security developed under the influence of a number of factors, among which the determining ones are: international standards; creation of a legal regulation mechanism harmonizing private and public interests as part of national interests; prompt response to external and internal challenges, creation of the most effective conditions for the existence of civil society, including economic, involvement of institutions of democratic civil control in this activity. It is established that the formation of legal and economic security of national security of Ukraine took place in three stages: the initial period, when the general rules of normalization of legal relations in this area were laid down; the period of unification and systematization of normative regulations in this sphere, taking into account the proportionality of public and private national interests included in the content of national security, with the priority of the latter, in particular in the field of economic security; the period of adaptation of the regulatory framework in the field of national security to the geopolitical challenges that Ukraine faced after the Revolution of Dignity. The defining features of these stages are characterized. It is established that the legal regulation and economic provision of national security of Ukraine today is determined by the following features: in the first place among the national interests are the state sovereignty, territorial integrity, democratic constitutional order, which are associated with a real threat to these interests due to the existing aggression; a number of strategic documents in the relevant areas of national security, the content of which contains a qualification of threats, directions of state policy and appropriate response measures, in particular to ensure economic security, were categorically defined; the legal status of subjects of national security has been normalized and significantly expanded; the content of the powers and functions of these subjects is reduced, and the content of the activities of citizens and public organizations is ignored; for the first time elements of democratic civil control in the sphere of national security are introduced into the legal field. Analyzed modern scientific developments on the national security of Ukraine, which allowed to highlight promising directions of development of measures of legal and economic nature aimed at ensuring national security, including the prevention of threats in the sphere of influence of geopolitical vectors of the modern world system on the formation of Ukrainian statehood, preventing the impact of negative factors of internal and external origin, in particular: separatism; cybercrime; corruption; economic and financial threats; energy crisis; COVID-19 pandemics, etc. In addition, a characteristic feature of such measures should be their ex-ordinary effectiveness, which is mediated by the involvement of all branches of government and institutions of civil society through deep coordination of such activities, the use of international experience, cooperation with international organizations of a military-economic type, the dissemination of the jurisprudence of international courts, using the example of the European Court of Human Rights, etc."
Hands-on cybersecurity training allows students and professionals to practice various tools and improve their technical skills. The training occurs in an interactive learning environment that enables completing sophisticated tasks in full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. During the training, the learning environment allows collecting data about trainees' interactions with the environment, such as their usage of command-line tools. These data contain patterns indicative of trainees' learning processes, and revealing them allows to assess the trainees and provide feedback to help them learn. However, automated analysis of these data is challenging. The training tasks feature complex problem-solving, and many different solution approaches are possible. Moreover, the trainees generate vast amounts of interaction data. This paper explores a dataset from 18 cybersecurity training sessions using data mining and machine learning techniques. We employed pattern mining and clustering to analyze 8834 commands collected from 113 trainees, revealing their typical behavior, mistakes, solution strategies, and difficult training stages. Pattern mining proved suitable in capturing timing information and tool usage frequency. Clustering underlined that many trainees often face the same issues, which can be addressed by targeted scaffolding. Our results show that data mining methods are suitable for analyzing cybersecurity training data. Educational researchers and practitioners can apply these methods in their contexts to assess trainees, support them, and improve the training design. Artifacts associated with this research are publicly available.
With the advancing digitization of our society, network security has become one of the critical concerns for most organizations. In this paper, we present CopAS, a system targeted at Big Data forensics analysis, allowing network operators to comfortably analyze and correlate large amounts of network data to get insights about potentially malicious and suspicious events. We demonstrate the practical usage of CopAS for insider attack detection on a publicly available PCAP dataset and show how the system can be used to detect insiders hiding their malicious activity in the large amounts of data streams generated during the operations of an organization within the network.
This study examines videos produced by the al-Hayat Media Center, a branch of the Islamic State's (IS) larger media campaign aimed more specifically at Western audiences. Using a thematic analysis approach, recurring themes of 10 al-Hayat videos were identified with conclusions made regarding the specificities of the message and the target audience. It was found that al-Hayat videos cater to potential Western recruits and sympathizers by portraying life in the IS as spiritually and existentially fulfilling, while simultaneously decrying the West as secular, immoral, and criminal. By utilizing well-produced propaganda videos that tap into the dissatisfactions of Western Muslims, al-Hayat was shown to deliver a sophisticated and legitimate message that may play a role in the larger radicalization process.
Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) requires the detection of the specific time frame Cryptographic Operations (COs) take place in the side-channel signal. Under laboratory conditions with full control over the Device under Test (DuT), dedicated trigger signals can be implemented to indicate the start and end of COs. For real-world scenarios, waveform-matching techniques have been established which compare the side-channel signal with a template of the CO's pattern in real time to detect the CO in the side channel. State-of-the-Art approaches describe implementations based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, the maximal length of the template is restricted by the resources available on an FPGAs. Particularly, for high sampling rates the recording of an entire CO may need more samples than the maximum template length supported by a waveform-matching system. Consequently, the template has to be reduced such that it fits the resources while still containing all features relevant for detecting the COs via waveform matching. In this paper, we introduce a generic interval-matching technique which provides several degrees of freedom for fine-tuning it to the statistical deviations of waveform measurements of COs. Moreover, we introduce a novel calibration method that finds the best parameters automatically based on statistical analysis of training data. Furthermore, we investigate a technique to reduce the number of features used for the interval matching by utilizing machine-learning-based feature extraction to find the most important samples in a template. Finally, we evaluate the state-of-the-art interval matching and our expansions during calibration and during the application on a test set. The results show, that a reliable reduction to 10% of the original template size is possible with a reduction method from literature for our example. However, the combination of our proposed methods can reliably work with only 15% of the original size and is less volatile than the state-of-the-art approach for reducing the number of features.
Case law analysis is a significant component of research on almost any legal issue and understanding which agents are involved and mentioned in a decision is integral part of the analysis. In this paper we present a first experiment in detecting mentions of different agents in court decisions automatically. We defined a light-weight and easily extensible hierarchy of agents that play important roles in the decisions. We used the types from the hierarchy to annotate a corpus of US court decisions. The resulting data set enabled us to test the hypothesis that the mentions of agents in the decisions could be detected automatically. Conditional random fields models trained on the data set were shown to be very promising in this respect. To support research in automatic case-law analysis we release the agent mentions data set with this paper.
In this work we address the main issues of IT consumerisation that are related to security risks, and propose a 'soft' mitigation strategy for user actions based on nudging, widely applied to health and social behaviour influence. In particular, we propose a complementary, less strict, more flexible Information Security policies, based on risk assessment of device vulnerabilities and threats to corporate data and devices, combined with a strategy of influencing security behaviour by nudging. We argue that nudging, by taking into account the context of the decision-making environment, and the fact that the employee may be in better position to make a more appropriate decision, may be more suitable than strict policies in situations of uncertainty of security-related decisions.

The U.S., Israel, China, and Iran are funding acts of hacker aggression, and the targets are as good as sitting ducks [GRI 13]. This statement describes the current reality in cyberspace. The activity in which a certain country or organization attacks other countries or organizations has long been topical, but unnoticed by the general public, which gives us the feeling that these are just isolated cases and that individuals who point out the burning issues are too pessimistic regarding warfare in cyberspace. However, cyberwarfare occurs constantly, and many reports published in recent months even recount of a war between countries.
The preceding decade has seen an explosive growth in illicit online commerce, and scholars are increasingly occupied with the study of illicit products, their buyers and sellers, and the platforms and markets in which they are found. Despite sharing one basic characteristic, the exchange of illicit goods and services, there is extensive variation between illicit online markets: Some markets employ currencies, others are based on barter. Some markets exhibit strong social control, others appear anarchic. Traditional theoretical explanations to the organization of illicit markets, which assume that optimization or evolution drives their organization, find it difficult to explain these variations. I propose a typology of illicit online markets that appreciates this heterogeneity and uses it as a theoretical point of departure. Drawing on social control theory and economic sociology, I argue that illicit online markets can be separated across two axes: administrative governance and marketness. This conceptual framework is not prone to functionalist inference and instead implies a less deterministic understanding of how illicit online markets come to be. In turn, this framework encourages the classification and comparison of individual markets, as well as comparative analyses of marketplaces.
In common law jurisdictions, legal research often involves an analysis of relevant case law. Court opinions comprise several high-level parts with different functions. A statement's membership in one of the parts is a key factor influencing how the statement should be understood. In this paper we present a number of experiments in automatically segmenting court opinions into the functional and the issue specific parts. We defined a set of seven types including Background, Analysis, and Conclusions. We used the types to annotate a sizable corpus of US trade secret and cyber crime decisions. We used the data set to investigate the feasibility of recognizing the parts automatically. The proposed framework based on conditional random fields proved to be very promising in this respect. To support research in automatic case law analysis we plan to release the data set to the public.
Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) requires the detection of the specific time frame within which Cryptographic Operations (COs) take place in the side-channel signal. In laboratory conditions with full control over the Device under Test (DuT), dedicated trigger signals can be implemented to indicate the start and end of COs. For real-world scenarios, waveform-matching techniques have been established which compare the side-channel signal with a template of the CO's pattern in real time to detect the CO in the side channel. State-of-the-art approaches are implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, current waveform-matching designs process the samples from Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) sequentially and can only work with low sampling rates due to the limited clock speed of FPGAs. This makes it increasingly difficult to apply existing techniques on modern DuTs that operate with clock speeds in the GHz range. In this paper, we present a parallel waveform-matching architecture that is capable of performing waveform matching at the speed of fast ADCs. We implement the proposed architecture in a high-end FPGA-based digitizer and deploy it to detect AES COs from the side channel of a single-board computer operating at 1 GHz. Our implementation allows for waveform matching at 10 GS/s with high accuracy, thus offering a speedup of 50x compared to the fastest state-of-the-art implementation known to us.
Telecommunications wiretaps are commonly used by law enforcement in criminal investigations. While phone-based wiretapping has seen considerable success, the same cannot be said for Internet taps. Large portions of intercepted Internet traffic are often encrypted, making it difficult to obtain useful information. The advent of the Internet of Things further complicates network wiretapping. In fact, the current level of complexity of intercepted network traffic is almost at the point where data cannot be analyzed without the active involvement of experts. Additionally, investigations typically focus on analyzing traffic in chronological order and predominately examine the data content of the intercepted traffic. This approach is overly arduous when the amount of data to be analyzed is very large. This chapter describes a novel approach for analyzing large amounts of intercepted network traffic based on traffic metadata. The approach significantly reduces the analysis time and provides useful insights and information to non-technical investigators. The approach is evaluated using a large sample of network traffic data.
Implanted microchips can store users' medical, financial, and other personal information, and provide users with easy and quick access to various locations and items. While adopted for their convenience outside of the healthcare sector, these invasive, semi-permanent implantable devices create augmented bodies that can be subject to ubiquitous surveillance. Situating human microchip implantations within surveillance literature, we draw from neoliberal perspectives of surveillance to examine augmented bodies, particularly as sources for market activity and as subjects of social control and sorting when these bodies are used as access control mechanisms, payment methods, and tracking means in employment, residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. History has demonstrated time and time again how unfettered technology applications and uses have led to real and/or perceived misuse by private and public sectors. Through the lens of function creep, we identify a pattern of expansion of applications and uses of technology beyond those originally intended across new technologies, such as DNA genetic genealogy databases, IoT wearables, and COVID-19 contact tracing apps, and provide illustrative examples of function creep, particularly the use of these technologies in criminal investigations and prosecutions despite not being intended or marketed for such use. By demonstrating the lack of clearly defined boundaries in the applications and uses of various new technologies and their associated data, and the ways they were misused, we demonstrate how human microchip implantations are headed on a similar path. The current and potential future uses of this technology raise concerns about the absence of regulation, law, and policy barring or limiting its application and use in specific sectors, and the impact of this technology on users' security, data protection, and privacy. Undeniably, the present and potential future functions, applications, uses, and extensions of human microchip implantations in various sectors warrant a proactive examination of their security, privacy, and data protection consequences and the implementation of proactive policies to regulate new and currently unregulated uses of this technology and its associated data within these sectors.
The unprecedented global public health crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic has caused mass upheaval of social, educational, financial, health, and justice systems around the world. Technological and other responses at the national, regional, and international level, designed to contain the spread of COVID-19, have also significantly interrupted the way that we live, work, and interact. This article explores the implications of these response efforts, and their impact on human rights, existing inequalities, and entrenched forms of discrimination. In particular, the article explores the implications of using mass surveillance and registration measures to detect, surveil, and control populations and their movements within and across borders as part of public health responses. The use of digital health credentials in automated social sorting processes and other mass surveillance and registration measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic sets an alarming precedent for future responses to global public health crises.
Partition refinement is a method for minimizing automata and transition systems of various types. Recently we have developed a partition refinement algorithm and the tool CoPaR that is generic in the transition type of the input system and matches the theoretical run time of the best known algorithms for many concrete system types. Genericity is achieved by modelling transition types as functors on sets and systems as coalgebras. Experimentation has shown that memory consumption is a bottleneck for handling systems with a large state space, while running times are fast. We have therefore extended an algorithm due to Blom and Orzan, which is suitable for a distributed implementation to the coalgebraic level of genericity, and implemented it in CoPaR. Experiments show that this allows to handle much larger state spaces. Running times are low in most experiments, but there is a significant penalty for some.
ObjectiveThe paper compares victim group characteristics: we test routine activities theory to compare the differences in online fraud vulnerabilities of victims aged 18-54 and victims of 55 and above. Methods/sampleA representative sample of US citizens 18 and above was collected in October 2020. Victims under 55 encompassed 35.3% (n = 915), victims 55 and above 12.9% (n = 334) of the total sample (n = 2,589). We utilized non-parametric statistical methods for testing whether older and younger victims' characteristics can be derived from the same independent variables. ResultsComputer time, computer familiarity, and technical guardians determine online victimization in older individuals, similarly to younger age groups. However, older victims differ in characteristics from younger victims. Seniors were less likely to apply technical guardians such as camera cover, identity theft monitoring, and credit card freeze, even after experiencing online scams. Being a single parent was a protective factor for older individuals, but having a full-time job made older individuals more prone to experience online fraud victimization compared to being retired. In addition, older victims were less likely to report scams than younger ones. Conclusion/implicationsAlthough this research found significant differences between older and younger fraud victims' characteristics, target suitability and capable guardianship must be further investigated and conceptualized when applying routine activities theory for online fraud against older people.
The present study aims at understanding what factors contribute to the explanation of online identity theft (OIT) victimization and fear, using the Routine Activity Theory (RAT). Additionally, it tries to uncover the influence of factors such as sociodemographic variables, offline fear of crime, and computer perception skills. Data for the present study were collected from a self-reported online survey administered to a sample of university students and staff (N = 832, 66% female). Concerning the OIT victimization, binary logistic regression analysis showed that those who do not used credit card had lower odds of becoming an OIT victim, and those who reported visiting risky contents presented higher odds of becoming an OIT victim. Moreover, males were less likely than females of being an OIT victim. In turn, fear of OIT was explained by socioeconomic status (negatively associated), education (positively associated) and by fear of crime in general (positively associated). In addition, subjects who reported more online interaction with strangers were less fearful, and those reported more avoiding behaviors reported higher levels of fear of OIT. Finally, subjects with higher computer skills are less fearful. These results will be discussed in the line of routine activities approach and implications for online preventive behaviors will be outlined.
"Purpose - This chapter examines how those who study issues related to radicalization and counter-radicalization have recently drawn from the experiences of former extremists to inform our understanding of complex issues in terrorism and extremism studies. Approach - The authors synthesize the empirical research on radicalization and counter-radicalization that incorporates formers in the research designs. In doing so, the authors trace these research trends as they unfold throughout the life-course: (1) extremist precursors; (2) radicalization toward extremist violence; (3) leaving violent extremism; and (4) combating violent extremism. Findings - While formers have informed our understanding of an array of issues related to radicalization and counter-radicalization, empirical research in this space is in its infancy and requires ongoing analyses. Value - This chapter provides researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with an in-depth account of how formers have informed radicalization and counter-radicalization research in recent years as well as an overview of some of the key gaps in the empirical literature."
Digital forensic evidence is subject to a variety of challenges, and these challenges apply in the Cloud as anywhere else. This chapter is an overview of these issues specifically oriented toward the Cloud Computing environments of today.
This chapter focuses on a theoretical approach to proactive evidence collection and presents a conceptual approach for the Cloud. Forensic Readiness in the Cloud (FRC) calls upon technological and organizational strategies to address the risks that threaten organizational information. The two professions of Records Management (RM) and Digital Forensics (DF) can offer insights into how this might be achieved. In this chapter, the authors seek to explore the relationship between the two disciplines and the areas where collaboration and interdisciplinary work would be most beneficial. An initial overview of RM and its relationship to the wider field of Information Assurance (IA) precedes a more in depth comparison of the two related disciplines, using a model that integrates RM and DF. This is offered as a conceptual framework for making decisions about how to identify and manage the increasing quantities of evidence collected on networks. Organizational Network Forensic Readiness (NFR) has emerged as a method for supporting collection of digital evidence from networks using suggested checklists, procedures, and tools. This chapter elaborates upon a previously documented life cycle methodology for 'operationalizing' organizational NFR and integrates this with best practice from RM in FRC. FRC provides a conceptual approach to proactive evidence collection and identifies the phases at which RM approaches and processes might be most effectively employed in the Cloud.
For the emerging field of cloud forensics, the development of validated and repeatable scientific processes for conducting cloud forensic investigations should include requirements that establish evidence collected as legally admissible. There is currently an uncertainty in the legal requirements for cloud forensics. Forensic investigations in the cloud introduce unique issues that must be addressed, and the legal environment of the cloud must be considered. The authors will detail the process in criminal cloud forensic investigations for commanding production from cloud providers including constitutional and statutory limitations, and the civil and criminal admissibility processes. Decisions in court cases rely on the authenticity and reliability of the evidence presented. Ensuring cases involving cloud forensics follow the proper legal process and requirements will be beneficial for validating evidence when presented in court. Further, understanding of legal requirements will aid in the research and development of cloud forensics tools to aid investigations.
Cloud computing as a paradigm shift is transforming how services are being delivered. In this chapter, the authors present a Forensics as a Service (FaaS) model using cloud computing to deliver forensic services. This model leverages the flexibility, elasticity, and dynamics of cloud computing, and is affordable for business, government, or individuals in need, due to its reduced cost. It also addresses the challenge of processing a large volume of forensic data by using MapReduce and distributed computing.
Cyberattacks are a primary concern for organisations of all kinds, costing billions of dollars globally each year. As more businesses begin operating online, and as attackers develop more advanced malware and evolve their modus operandi, the demand for effective cyber security measures grows exponentially. One such measure is the threat intelligence platform (TIP): a system which gathers and presents information about current cyber threats, providing actionable insight to aid security teams in employing a more proactive approach to thwarting attacks. These platforms and their accompanying intelligence feeds can be costly when purchased from a commercial vendor, creating a financial barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises. This paper explores the use of crowdsourced open-source intelligence (OSINT) as an alternative to commercial threat intelligence. A model TIP is developed using a combination of crowdsourced OSINT, freeware, and cloud services, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of using OSINT over commercial solutions. The developed TIP is evaluated using a dataset containing 16,713 malware samples collected via the MalwareBazaar repository.
This article is a theoretical treatment of the ways in which local worldviews on wealth acquisition give rise to contemporary manifestations of spirituality in cyberspace. It unpacks spiritual (occult) economies and wealth generation through a historical perspective. The article 'devil advocates' the 'sainthood' of claimed law-abiding citizens, by highlighting that the line dividing them and the Nigerian cybercriminals (Yahoo-Boys) is blurred with regards to the use of magical means for material ends. By doing so, the article also illustrates that the intersectionality of the spirit world and the acquisition of wealth (crime or otherwise) is connected with local epistemologies and worldviews, and its contemporaneity has social security benefits. Therefore, the view that the contemporary manifestations of spirituality in cyberspace signify a 'new-danger' and an ever-increasing outrage in Nigerian society is misplaced. I conclude that if people believe all aspects of life are reflective of the spiritual world and determined by it, the spiritual realm, by implication, is the base of society, upon which sits the superstructure comprised of all aspects of life, especially wealth. Inferentially, this conceptual position that the spirit world is the base of society is an inversion of Orthodox Marxist's theory of economic determinism.
The rise in research work focusing on detection of cyberbullying incidents on social media platforms particularly reflect how dire cyberbullying consequences are, regardless of age, gender or location. This paper examines scholarly publications (i.e., 2011-2022) on cyberbullying detection using machine learning through a systematic literature review approach. Specifically, articles were sought from six academic databases (Web of Science, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery, Scopus, and Google Scholar), resulting in the identification of 4126 articles. A redundancy check followed by eligibility screening and quality assessment resulted in 68 articles included in this review. This review focused on three key aspects, namely, machine learning algorithms used to detect cyberbullying, features, and performance measures, and further supported with classification roles, language of study, data source and type of media. The findings are discussed, and research challenges and future directions are provided for researchers to explore.
In today's dynamic information technology system, one area of tremendous focus and recent growth has been that of the cloud-computing model in its various offerings. With this growth, however, come new challenges within the realms of e-discovery and digital forensics, as we traditionally know it. The rapid growth of cloud-computing services and the rate of acceptance and use by consumers are on the rise. Conversely, both legitimate and illegitimate activates can leverage the resources of the cloud to execute their operations. With the challenges growing to combat computer crime that utilizes the cloud ecosystem and the ease of which a criminal activity may be hidden using a cloud service, it is imperative that a cloud provider dedicate time, training, budget, and other resources to provide the facility for forensic investigators as well as law enforcement to combat this threat. The Cloud-Forensics-as-a-Service (FRaaS) model introduced later in this chapter can provide a comprehensive cloud forensics solution for creating a repeatable system. Such a system could be implemented as a standard forensics operational model for deployment within the cloud ecosystem regardless of environments and client service lines.
In recent years, the number of fake shopping sites that scam people out of their money or steal their personal information has skyrocketed. To address this problem, Japanese law enforcement agencies such as the police have been detecting fake shopping sites through information provided by a third party and by conducting manual investigations. However, this current approach is quite inefficient. Despite a number of recent studies that use machine learning to detect fake sites, there is still no system for automatically detecting fake shopping sites. Therefore, in this study, we developed an automatic detection system for fake shopping sites to solve the problem of detection inefficiency faced by law enforcement agencies in Japan. The proposed system successfully identified an average of 118,000 target URLs per day from the list of newly registered domains and collected an average of 51,000 sets of HTML data. Also, it was able to determine with 98.5% accuracy using machine learning whether the collected data were fake shopping sites or not. Since this system was able to meet the time requirements for actual operation, we developed an automatic detection system for fake Japanese shopping sites.
Cloud Computing will be a disruptive technology that will ultimately change the face of computing with a market approaching $300 billion over the next five years, according to recent study from the Market Intel Group (Mathews, 2010). The unstoppable migration of data to the Cloud is undoubtedly due to numerous financial benefits, particularly for small and medium-sized companies, which historically do not have the same capital budgets as larger enterprises. However, this boundless upside is not without risks from a legal and compliance perspective, making it all that more important for entities to look before they leap. Today, nearly every corporation is required to preserve and produce Electronically Stored Information (ESI), such as emails and other electronic documents, as part of their response to litigation, regulatory inquiries, and subpoenas. When the subject ESI happens to be stored in the Cloud, there are a handful of potential obstacles that serve to complicate the eDiscovery process. For some, this leads to sanctions and increased compliance risks. In order to navigate these potentially treacherous waters, organizations need to be proactive and follow a measure twice, cut once approach. This chapter will discuss the basics of eDiscovery and explore ways to minimize potential compliance hurdles when migrating significant data stores to/from the Cloud.
The dangers of contamination have received considerable attention in the literature regarding the investigation of physical crime scenes and physical evidence. The understanding of contamination in the context of digital evidence appears to be much less understood. Based on experiences from the field of physical evidence, we develop a generalized definition of contamination that also covers digital evidence, namely the inadvertent transfer of traits to an object of relevance at any point in the forensic process. We illustrate the definition by presenting several examples and counterexamples for contamination of digital evidence. By addressing the specifics of digital evidence in this context, we argue that our definition can be useful to understand the risks arising through contamination in this domain.

Flow monitoring has become an essential source of information for intrusion detection systems and various forms of network data analytics. However, the attention of researchers is focused primarily on the utilisation of the flow data, and the process of flow data creation is often neglected. This lack of consideration negatively affects the results of data analytics. Either the results are suboptimal due to the low quality of the flow data, or a description of the configuration of the flow monitoring system is missing, which leads to irreproducible results. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the configuration of the flow monitoring system affects the resulting data. The most basic flow monitoring configuration variables are the flow expiration timeouts. We analyse their effect on the number of created flow records to show their importance. Moreover, we demonstrate that the choice of the flow expiration timeouts can have a severe impact on the network data analytics. The use-case of Slowloris attack detection is used as an example to illustrate this fact.
In recent years, topic modeling has become an established method in the analysis of text corpora, with probabilistic techniques such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) commonly employed for this purpose. However, it might be argued that adequate attention is often not paid to the issue of topic coherence, the semantic interpretability of the top terms usually used to describe discovered topics. Nevertheless, a number of studies have proposed measures for analyzing such coherence, where these have been largely focused on topics found by LDA, will-matrix decomposition techniques such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) being somewhat overlooked in comparison. This motivates the current work, where we compare and analyze topics found by popular variants of both NMF and LDA in multiple corpora in terms of both their coherence and associated generality, using a combination of existing and new measures, including one based on distributional semantics. Two out of three coherence measures find NMF to regularly produce more coherent topics, with higher levels of generality and redundancy observed with the LDA topic descriptors. In all cases, we observe that the associated term weighting strategy plays a major role. The results observed with NMF suggest that this may be a more suitable topic modeling method when analyzing certain corpora, such as those associated with niche or non-mainstream domains.

This article highlights the importance of copyright industries for the developed economies and argues that criminal copyright infringement is a widespread offense, producing major economic losses for stakeholders, negatively impacting creativity, and raising significant cybersecurity and rule of law concerns. The article explains why there is a need for criminal protection of copyright protection and outlines the U.S. framework. In a comprehensive approach, based on a large corpus of data, consisting of cases brought to federal courts, in violation of Section 506 of Title 17 of the U.S. Code, and press releases and reports by law enforcement and industry groups, Section 3 describes the forms and extent of the phenomenon. Section 4 discusses essential aspects involved in the prosecution of these cases. Based on the number of cases brought to courts versus the criminal copyright infringing reports and estimates, the article concludes that this criminal phenomenon is significantly under-prosecuted and proposes a number of measures that could improve the criminal protection of copyrighted works.
"Cyber-attacks have become commonplace in the world of the Internet. The nature of cyber-attacks is gradually changing. Early cyber-attacks were usually conducted by curious personal hackers who used simple techniques to hack homepages and steal personal information. Lately, cyber attackers have started using sophisticated cyber-attack techniques that enable them to retrieve national confidential information beyond the theft of personal information or defacing websites. These sophisticated and advanced cyber-attacks can disrupt the critical infrastructures of a nation. Much research regarding cyber-attacks has been conducted; however, there has been a lack of research related to measuring cyber-attacks from the perspective of offensive cybersecurity. This motivated us to propose a methodology for quantifying cyber-attacks such that they are measurable rather than abstract. For this purpose, we identified each element of offensive cybersecurity used in cyber-attacks. We also investigated the extent to which the detailed techniques identified in the offensive cyber-security framework were used, by analyzing cyber-attacks. Based on these investigations, the complexity and intensity of cyber-attacks can be measured and quantified. We evaluated advanced persistent threats (APT) and fileless cyber-attacks that occurred between 2010 and 2020 based on the methodology we developed. Based on our research methodology, we expect that researchers will be able to measure future cyber-attacks."
Criminal procedure is increasingly becoming an important instrument of prevention. This is a globally observed tendency, and Poland is not an exception. There are several regulations in the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure that allow the preventive use of coercive measures. In 2020, a new and controversial regulation was introduced, authorising the public prosecutor or court to prohibit the publication of content interfering with the legally protected goods of the victim. The author criticises the new preventive measure as duplicating civil law injunctions and expresses the opinion that, in criminal procedure, preventive measures should be used to prevent crime, not every illegal activity. In addition, the article describes the criminal procedure for isolating persons obliged to quarantine themselves because they have tested positive for Covid-19 or had contact with infected persons. This raises the question of the limits of the preventive function of provisional arrest and possible abuse of the criminal process using it for aims unrelated to the traditional goal of the criminal process: determining the question of guilt of the accused.
This chapter aims to be a high-level introduction into the fundamental concepts of both digital forensic investigations and cloud computing for non-experts in one or both areas. Once fundamental concepts are established, this work begins to examine cloud computing security-related questions, specifically how past security challenges are inherited or solved by cloud computing models, as well as new security challenges that are unique to cloud environments. Next, an analysis is given of the challenges and opportunities cloud computing brings to digital forensic investigations. Finally, the Integrated Digital Investigation Process model is used as a guide to illustrate considerations and challenges during an investigation involving cloud environments.
The goal of this chapter is to explain the challenges that the forensic investigator faces when investigating Cloud Crime and how they can learn from the techniques used by Ethical Hackers to improve their investigation technique. The security threat posed by hackers on the Internet is constantly evolving. Cloud computing provides new avenues for hackers to exploit organizations, giving rise to new classes of vulnerability, and new security challenges. The forensic investigator must learn to think like a hacker so that they can reconstruct the path the hacker takes through the cloud environment. This chapter will explain how an Ethical Hacker works, how the Ethical Hacker views the Cloud, and in doing so illustrate the new challenges facing a forensic investigator.
Cloud computing is a major transition, and it comes at a unique historical and strategic time for applying foundational design thinking to secure the next-generation computing infrastructure and enable waves of business and technological innovation. In this chapter, the researcher summarizes six key research and development areas for designing a forensic-enabling cloud ecosystem, including architecture and matrix, standardization and strategy, evidence segregation, security and forensic integration, legal framework, and privacy.
Data acquisition and data recovery are essential to any e-discovery or digital forensic process. However, these two aspects seem to be considerably difficult in a cloud-computing environment. The very nature of the Cloud raises a number of technical and organizational challenges, which renders traditional approaches and tools inapplicable. Resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and geographical distribution of data are only a small part of the Cloud's features that hinder the forensic investigation. At the same time, there is significant absence of forensic readiness in cloud computing policy framework. In this chapter, the authors discuss the challenges pertaining to data acquisition in a cloud environment and discuss possible directions for meeting these challenges by presenting representative cases and sketching acquisition process and scenarios.
Despite a growing adoption of cloud computing, law enforcement and the judicial system are unprepared to prosecute cloud-based crimes. This chapter illuminates legal problems in the United States for electronic discovery and digital forensics arising from cloud computing and argues that cloud computing challenges the process and product of electronic discovery. The researchers investigate how to obtain forensic evidence from cloud computing using the legal process by surveying the existing statues and recent cases applicable to cloud forensics. A hypothetical case study of child pornography being hosted in the Cloud illustrates the difficulty in acquiring evidence for cloud-related crimes. For the first time, a sample search warrant is presented that could be used in this case study, and which provides sample language for agents and prosecutors who wish to obtain a warrant authorizing the search and seizure of data from cloud computing environments. The chapter concludes by taking a contrasting view and discusses how defense attorneys might be able to challenge cloud-derived evidence in court.
Improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of public services has become a growing concern for many governments across the world, and more so with recent popularity of online services, widely referred as e-government services. The application of quality approaches for measuring and improving e-government services has been the subject of much research within the academic world over the last two decades. This chapter discusses the use of key quality approaches to improve services in Jordan's e-government initiatives. As more and more developing countries are adopting e-services as a means of providing quality services to their community and people through the Web, the necessary benchmarking plays an important role. Many traditional quality benchmarking performance measurements have proved futile in improving e-government services due to their quantitative focus. Though qualitative frameworks and measurement approaches such as Six Sigma and Balanced Scorecard have found their success in certain industry sectors, their relevance in the service sector has drawn attention only recently. While some studies have employed such approaches for evaluating projects in information and communication technologies, literature lacks investigations in the e-government sector. To fill this gap, this chapter investigates the application of Six Sigma and Balanced Scorecard approaches to improve quality in Jordanian e-government services.
A vehicular ad-hoc network consists of multiple local networks due to the limited communication range of Onboard Processing Unit utilised by participating vehicles. Therefore, multiple re-transmission attempts by relay vehicles are required to propagate an original information packet. However, these necessary re-transmissions cause Broadcast Storm Problem (BSP) which can in-turn create network congestions. This paper addresses the issues associated with BSP by proposing an Optimised Relay Vehicle Selection (ORVS) mechanism. To devise the strategy for an ORVS mechanism, an Evolutionary Game (EG) strategy is utilised that consists of a novel payoff function. In addition to this, we also propose a (BG) to simulate a VANET environment, which is implemented using Python, for collection of results. The numerical results obtained by the proposed EG are compared with the existing techniques, which show better performance by the ORVS mechanisms produced by the game theoretical approaches.
During this era of the Internet of Things, millions of devices such as automobiles, smoke detectors, watches, glasses and webcams are being connected to the Internet. The number of devices with the ability of monitor and collect data is continuously increasing. The Internet of Things enhances human comfort and convenience, but it raises serious questions related to security and privacy. It also creates significant challenges for digital investigators when they encounter Internet of Things devices in criminal scenes. In fact, current research focuses on security and privacy in Internet of Things environments as opposed to forensic acquisition and analysis techniques for Internet of Things devices. This chapter focuses on the major challenges with regard to Internet of Things forensics. A forensic approach for Internet of Things devices is presented using a smartwatch as a case study. Forensic artifacts retrieved from the smartwatch are analyzed and the evidence found is discussed with respect to the challenges facing Internet of Things forensics.
The unprecedented interest in cryptocurrency-related investments over the past five years has gone from a relatively unknown speculative investment to a mainstream practice and hobby. Novice investors looking for financial gains are now able to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency due to social media, smartphone applications, and online forums-all of which disseminate information and build trust in collaborative investment strategies. While many investors have used these platforms for financial gain, others have been the target and victim of relentless scams and forms of fraud. In this paper we argue that despite the advantages of novel financial systems that attempt create access to wealth for a broader base of individuals, the mechanisms behind cryptocurrency marketing, knowledge, and investment are predatory in nature and create a culture designed to pressure and coerce uneducated investors into financial victimhood. Specifically, we present a theoretical model whereby cryptoculture-as we define it-unintentionally produces target congruence of motivated offenders with an excess of suitable targets, further exacerbated by the lack of face-to-face engagement of online encounters. By Articulating a theoretical model should guide future studies in operationalizing cryptoculture and cryptocurrency fraud and prevent future cryptocurrency scams and fraud.
"Cloud computing is just one of many recent technologies that have highlighted shortcomings in the development of formal digital forensic processes, which up until now have been focused on a particular group of practitioners, such as law enforcement, and have been too high-level to be of significant practical use, or have been too detailed and specific to accommodate new technology as it emerges. Because the tools and procedures employed by digital forensic practitioners are generally outside the knowledge and understanding of the courts, they need to be described in such a way that they can be understood by the layperson. In addition, they should also conform to some standards of practice and be recognised by other practitioners working in the field (Armstrong, 2003; Kessler, 2010). Unfortunately, as Cohen (2011) points out, the whole field of digital forensics lacks consensus in fundamental aspects of its activities in terms of methodology and procedures. There has been a lot of activity around different aspects of cloud computing, and in Australia this has centered on the protection of personal data (Solomon, 2010). On an international scale, there have been several articles written by lawyers (Gillespie, 2012; Hutz, 2012; Kunick, 2012) discussing other legal considerations of accessing data in the cloud; however, this chapter looks at the issues surrounding digital evidence acquisition and introduces a new high-level process model that can assist digital forensic practitioners when it comes to presenting evidence in court that originated in the cloud."
Just about every technology magazine and article published today mentions virtualization or cloud computing. Technically, the two are different but very much intertwined. When environments use virtualization, there are artifacts an investigator can request that may provide valuable information. The content of this chapter explores the virtualization process, types of virtualized environments, and the part virtualization plays in cloud computing. A section will be included that presents case scenarios to demonstrate the type of evidence gathered in each environment for forensic investigations. A final section will include recommendations for additional areas of research in the area of investigating environments containing virtualization integration with cloud environments.
This article seeks to establish the connection-via shared discourse-between Incels and mainstream pornography. With an interdisciplinary approach which involves a Corpus Linguistics analysis of Reddit forum data, research into digital behaviors, and a feminist critique, this article focuses on the commonalities between the language of pornography and that of Incels. In doing so, it demonstrates how both pornography and Incels are different manifestations of the same misogyny. The findings of this study highlight the normalization of violence against women (VAW), which continues to be endemic in society, enabled and exacerbated by contemporary technologies.
International studies have shown that information security for process control systems, in particular SCADA, is weak. Many of the critical infrastructure (CI) services critically depend on process control systems. Therefore, any vulnerability in the protection of process control systems in CI may result in serious consequences for citizens and society. In order to understand their sector-wide security posture, the drinking water sector in The Netherlands benchmarked the information security of their process control environment. Large differences in the individual security postures of the ten drinking water companies were found. Good Practices for SCADA security were developed based upon the benchmark results. This paper discusses the simple but effective approach taken to perform the benchmark, the way the results were reported to the drinking water companies, and the way in which the SCADA information security good practices were developed. Apart from some high-level indications of areas requiring more security attention, no actual security posture results are presented in this paper since the study data contain company and national sensitive information. For the same reason, the figures in this paper are based on artificial data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Advanced and autonomous defence systems are needed to detect and mitigate new cyber attacks that target emerging technologies. This research defines cybersecurity preliminaries and stimulates questions to expose the complexities of automation and autonomous cybersecurity. A concept of autonomous anomaly management is introduced, where anomalies are defined not just as anomalous human readable strings, but as unknown changes and the need to better manage changes that can not be easily explained. Cybernetic principles are explored, and experiments are undertaken for quantitative analysis. Biodiversity Indices that compare relationships between species and communities in ecology are applied to cybernetic environments, to compare dynamic relationships between business applications. The proposed Cyber Diversity Index applies to all software-driven systems and environments. Changes of application's system calls are measured in real-time and monitored for unknown diversity changes, or the anomaly, when the system is placed under a zero-day attack. Experimental data is collected from continuous sampling of applications' activity states, which contributes to both the behavioral change profiles and the dynamic normal baselines for the autonomous anomaly management. The findings in this research show that it is possible to define unique system entropic behaviors from applications' activity that is triggered from internal or external stimulus.
This paper reports comparative authorship attribution results obtained on the Internet comments of the morphologically complex Lithuanian language. We have explored the impact of machine learning and similarity-based approaches on the different author set sizes (containing 10, 100, and 1,000 candidate authors), feature types (lexical, morphological, and character), and feature selection techniques (feature ranking, random selection). The authorship attribution task was complicated due to the used Lithuanian language characteristics, non-normative texts, an extreme shortness of these texts, and a large number of candidate authors. The best results were achieved with the machine learning approaches. On the larger author sets the entire feature set composed of word-level character tetra-grams demonstrated the best performance.
"Phishing victimization is prevalent and results in theft of personal identifiable information (PII) or installing malware to steal PII. Drawing upon social psychological and criminological theories, we conducted a prospective study to assess three groups of predictors to being phished or not: a) prior victimization; b) protective or vulnerable habitual strategies, and c) emotional and cognitive decision-making styles. Students (N = 236) completed a survey assessing these predictors and then about 4 weeks later received a phishing e-mail using the university's phishing testing system. The e-mail requested that they click on a link and enter their student ID to avoid having their account blocked. About half (50.8%) clicked on the link, and 81.6% of those phished entered their PII. Individuals who had low avoidant style and high generalized anxiety were four times more likely to be phished, after controlling for the significant effects of vulnerable habitual strategies and using dating apps. Machine learning analyses also found cognitive styles and generalized anxiety are the better predictors of getting phished compared to vulnerable and protective strategies and prior victimization. These findings suggest that cybersecurity training needs to be expanded to address the emotional and cognitive processing of deceptive appeals in e-mails."
Recent political events have brought renewed attention to the adaptation of immigrants in the United States, and their involvement in crime. Immigrants vary significantly in terms of when they migrate into the country. According to the Current Population Survey (CPS) (2017), of the population of approximately 13 million foreign-born immigrant children living in the United States, approximately 40% arrived during early childhood, 30% during middle childhood, and 30% during adolescence. A better understanding of the relationship between age at migration and offending can inform not only immigration policies, and policies related to the control of crime, but also policies related to immigrant-receiving institutions such as schools and social services. Using data from The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), this study explores the influence of age at migration on criminal offending among foreign-born immigrants who migrated prior to adulthood.
Western law enforcement agencies have made multiple arrests targeting individuals purchasing firearms on Dark Web platforms in recent years, as these transactions may violate national laws and facilitate offline violence. Despite its market presence and growth, research exploring these online illicit markets has been scant, especially as it relates to how firearms are priced on the Dark Web, and the factors that influence their price point. Given this gap in the literature, the current study utilized a sample of 287 firearm products across 20 Dark Web vendors operating in both crypto markets and shops to identify the range and pricing model of illicit weapons. Analyses revealed that long guns offered on the Dark Web had lower average listed prices than their manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), while handguns had higher advertised prices than their recommended retail value. Further, products' MSRP was a significant predictor of firearms' price point for both handguns and long guns, whereas offering a customer service line was only significant for handguns' price point. The implications of this analysis for our understanding of illicit online market operations are discussed in detail.
Prominent terrorism case studies of individuals such as Omar Mateen, Dylann Roof, and Mohammed Merah indicate the need for personality trait-based terrorism risk assessment/threat assessment (TR/TA). This chapter provides an overview of Corrado's, personality-based TR/TA instrument (see Chapter 14) by explaining the origin of each domain and the purpose of inclusion. Furthermore, this chapter displays results from a preliminary instrument validation study conducted on an open-source sample of 158 terrorists. Results of this study suggest strong statistical significance for many of the domains. This suggests the need for future inclusion of personality-based indicators in terrorism risk assessment.
The so-called a posteriori approach to optimization with multiple conflicting objective functions is to compute or approximate a Pareto front of solutions. In case of continuous objective functions a finite approximation to this set can be computed. Indicator-based multiobjective optimization algorithms compute solution sets that are optimal with respect to some quality measure on sets, such as the commonly used hypervolume indicator (HI). The HI measures the size of the space that is dominated by a given set of solutions. It has many favorable monotonicity properties but it requires a reference point the choice of which is often done ad-hoc. In this study the concept of set monotonic functions for dominated subsets is introduced. Moreover, this work presents a reference point free hypervolume indicator that uses a density that is derived from the user's preferences expressed as desirability functions. This approach will bias the distribution of the approximation set towards a set that more densely samples highly desirable solutions of the objective space. We show that the Harrington type and the Derringer-Suich type of desirability functions yield definite integrals and that the Harrington type has also the favorable property to provide a set-monotonic function over the set of dominated subspaces. It is shown that for a product type of aggregation the weighted hypervolume indicator is mathematically equivalent with an approach that computes the standard hypervolume indicator after transformation of the axes. In addition a probabilistic interpretation of desirability functions is discussed and how a correlation parameter can be introduced in order to change the aggregation type. Finally, practical guidelines for using the discussed set indicator in multiobjective search, for instance when searching for interesting subsets from a database, are provided. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Recently, deep learning techniques have garnered substantial attention for their ability to identify vulnerable code patterns accurately. However, current state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) require substantial computational resources. This results in a level of overhead that makes their implementation unfeasible for deployment in real-time settings. This study presents a novel transformer-based vulnerability detection framework, referred to as VulDetect, which is achieved through the fine-tuning of a pre-trained large language model, (GPT) on various benchmark datasets of vulnerable code. Our empirical findings indicate that our framework is capable of identifying vulnerable software code with an accuracy of up to 92.65%. Our proposed technique outperforms SyseVR and VulDeBERT, two state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques.
It has long been lamented that firms underreport cyber attacks. In recent years, regulators have begun mandating that certain organizations must publicly report when incidents occur. Adherence to these requirements is an empirical question that has been largely unexamined to date. In this paper, we study regulatory filings by U.S. public companies to the Securities Exchange Commission and to the Department Health and Human Services that discuss cyber attacks. We also compare the findings against crowdsourced reports of cyber incidents appearing in media outlets. We find substantial gaps in coverage, both in terms of attacks that make the news but do not appear in regulatory filings and vice versa. We conclude by discussing the implications for the study of cyber attack and defense as well as for policymakers.
We explored the transmission mechanisms of corporate fraud and its punishments within social network communities. Using fraud triangle theory and trust triangle theory, we hypothesize four transmitting chan-nels of how fraud commission and detection are affected by peers' fraud and punishment. Based on Chinese listed corporations from 2008 to 2018, we first construct and detect interlocked social network communities with a community-detecting algorithm, and then examine hypotheses using a bivariate probit model with partial observability. Our findings indicate that peer-concealing and-hinting effects exist within social net-work communities. The peer-concealing effect decreases the likelihood of being detected when committing fraud, for those with more and closer fraudulent peers. The peer-hinting effect increases the likelihood of being detected when committing fraud, for those with more and closer punished peers. There is no evidence to support peer-contagion and vicarious-punishment effects. Thus, an improved understanding of the trans-mission mechanism of corporate fraud commission and detection within communities is provided to prevent and detect corporate fraud. In addition, stakeholders and regulators should be aware of the deviant subculture and social distancing in social network communities.
We identify over a quarter of a million domains used by medium and large companies within the .com registry. We find that for around 7% of these companies very similar domain names have been registered with character changes that are intended to be indistinguishable at a casual glance. These domains would be suitable for use in Business Email Compromise frauds. Using historical registration and name server data we identify the timing, rate, and movement of these look-alike domains over a ten year period. This allows us to identify clusters of registrations which are quite clearly malicious and show how the criminals have moved their activity over time in response to countermeasures. Although the malicious activity peaked in 2016, there is still sufficient ongoing activity to cause concern.
The development of the Darknet as a parallel network to the Web in the 21st century has facilitated illegal trafficking in small arms, as defined by the United Nations. The authors have used investigative research methodologies to observe six weapon sale sites on the Darknet over a six-month period to identify sellers of firearms, the type and caliber of weapons for sale, manufacturer, price in Bitcoin, and the principle national origins of the firearms. This is the first study of its type to explore the illegal sale of firearms on the Darknet. This evidence can be used by law enforcement to intercept and shut down said sites and provide insight to the nature of the illegal arms trade on the Darknet.
The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a growing aspect of how entities, including humans and organizations, are likely to connect with others in their public and private interactions. The exponential rise in the number of IoT devices, resulting from ever-growing IoT applications, also gives rise to new opportunities for exploiting potential security vulnerabilities. In contrast to conventional cryptosystems, frameworks that incorporate fine-grained access control offer better opportunities for protecting valuable assets, especially when the connectivity level is dense. Functional encryption is an exciting new paradigm of public-key encryption that supports fine-grained access control, generalizing a range of existing fine-grained access control mechanisms. This survey reviews the recent applications of functional encryption and the major cryptographic primitives that it covers, identifying areas where the adoption of these primitives has had the greatest impact. We first provide an overview of different application areas where these access control schemes have been applied. Then, an in-depth survey of how the schemes are used in a multitude of applications related to IoT is given, rendering a potential vision of security and integrity that this growing field promises. Towards the end, we identify some research trends and state the open challenges that current developments face for a secure IoT realization.
Trust is a fundamental aspect in enabling a smooth adoption of robotic technical innovations in our societies. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable to uplift digital contributions to our societies while protecting environmental resources, its ethical and technical trust dimensions bring significant challenges for a sustainable evolution of robotic systems. Inspired by the safety assurance case, in this paper we introduce the concept of trust assurance case together with the implementation of its ethical and technical principles directed towards assuring a trustworthy sustainable evolution of AI-enabled robotic systems.
Highly manipulative online and telephone scams committed by strangers target everyone, but older individuals are especially susceptible to being victimized. This study aimed to (1) identify why older individuals decide not to report scams and, in parallel, (2) explore the needs of victims. Thirty-five interviews were conducted with Virginia residents who were 60 years or older in 2021. The interpretive phenomenological analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed that victims are reluctant to report crimes or ask for help from their family or community because much-needed emotional, educational, and technical help is often inaccessible or inadequate. In particular, we found that family responses tend to intrude on privacy, community responses are not meaningful or are non-existent, police responses are inadequate, and prevention programs are inaccessible and not specified to meet the needs of older age groups. We recommend developing age-appropriate prevention and education programs, by applying the intergenerational group approach, and actively listening to victims' concerns before deciding what means of help should be applied. Research implications and recommendations are presented.
Users of computing systems and devices frequently make decisions related to information security, e.g., when choosing a password, deciding whether to log into an unfamiliar wireless network. Employers or other stakeholders may have a preference for certain outcomes, without being able to or having a desire to enforce a particular decision. In such situations, systems may build in design nudges to influence the decision making, e.g., by highlighting the employer's preferred solution. In this paper we model influencing information security to identify which approaches to influencing are most effective and how they can be optimized. To do so, we extend traditional multi-criteria decision analysis models with modifiable criteria, to represent the available approaches an influencer has for influencing the choice of the decision maker. The notion of influence power is introduced to characterize the extent to which an influencer can influence decision makers. We illustrate our approach using data from a controlled experiment on techniques to influence which public wireless network users select. This allows us to calculate influence power and identify which design nudges exercise the most influence over user decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Background: Many efforts have been undertaken to construct an overview of various aspects of illicit drug distribution in the United Kingdom. Yet given that national, regional, and local differences can be profound, this has proven difficult, to the extent that Scotland has been largely excluded from the conversation. In addition, the level of supply being examined, the drug type, and the actors involved only add to confusion and vast differences between some findings. Method: The current study aims to provide a holistic account, as best as possible considering variations of illegal drug supply in illicit networks, by focusing in on a particular geographical context (Scotland) and addressing drug supply at all levels. It is informed by in-depth interviews with 42 offenders involved in drug distribution from retail to wholesale/middle market to importation levels. Results: Findings indicate Scotland's importation and distribution is evolving owing to increasingly adaptive risk mitigation by importers and distributors, and market diversification of both product and demand. While a hierarchical model still dominates the market, commuting or 'county lines' and increasing demand for drugs such as cannabis, but also anabolic steroids and psychoactive substances, means that home growing, online purchasing, and street-level dealership is common. Conclusion: The findings have the capacity to further inform police and practitioners about the diverse and evolving nature of drug distribution in Scotland (with a particular focus on the west of the country), so that they may become more effective in improving the safety and wellbeing of people, places and communities.
Industrial control systems (ICSs) used to be operated in closed networks, that is, separated physically from the Internet and corporate networks, and independent protocols were used for each manufacturer. Thus, their operation was relatively safe from cyberattacks. However, with advances in recent technologies, such as big data and internet of things, companies have been trying to use data generated from the ICS environment to improve production yield and minimize process downtime. Thus, ICSs are being connected to the internet or corporate networks. These changes have increased the frequency of attacks on ICSs. Despite this increased cybersecurity risk, research on ICS security remains insufficient. In this paper, we analyze threats in detail using STRIDE threat analysis modeling and DREAD evaluation for distributed control systems, a type of ICSs, based on our work experience as cybersecurity specialists at a refinery. Furthermore, we verify the validity of threats identified using STRIDE through case studies of major ICS cybersecurity incidents: Stuxnet, BlackEnergy 3, and Triton. Finally, we present countermeasures and strategies to improve risk assessment of identified threats.
In this paper we are conducting a series of experiments with several state-of-the-art models, based on Transformers architecture, to perform Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) on text of different styles (social networks vs. news) and languages, and with different levels of noise. We are using different publicly-available datasets such as WNUT17, CoNLL2002 and CoNLL2003. Furthermore, we synthetically add extra levels of noise (random capitalization, random character additions/replacements/removals, etc.), to study the impact and the robustness of the models. The Transformer models we compare (mBERT, CANINE, mDeBERTa) use different tokenisation strategies (token-based vs. character-based) which may exhibit different levels of robustness towards certain types of noise. The experiments show that the subword-based models (mBERT and mDeBERTa) tend to achieve higher scores, especially in the presence of clean text. However, when the amount of noise increases, the character-based tokenisation exhibits a smaller performance drop, suggesting that models such as CANINE might be a better candidate to deal with noisy text.
Libel sites publish anonymously submitted unproven libelous claims about individuals that often include personal information about the subject. The stated goal of the sites is to warn the public about an individual but the impact is harassment and ruining the subject's reputation. These individual libelous posts are surfaced when searching for a person's name using an online search engine and can cause a range of harms from emotional to economic. For example, the libelous posts might surface if a potential employer performs a Google search as part of a background check. There have been prior news reports of this troubling phenomena but no systematic analysis of the ecosystem. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis of these libel sites, supporting services, and intervention by Google. We discovered and analyzed 9 libel sites, 7 websites for reputation management services, and 12 related websites. We found that all of the libel websites included at least one method of generating revenue. The most common revenue generation method was including advertisements for reputation management services which require payment for the removal of a post. We found that all of these removal services were dubious in nature and that the removal policies were akin to extortion. Our analysis of Google's intervention to reduce the visibility of these websites indicated that it appeared to only reduce the visibility of the specific libel post URL but that other URLs containing links to the post or the headline text of the post were still highly ranked. Based on our findings, we make recommendations to many of the stakeholders about potential approaches for mitigating this abusive ecosystem.
In the a-posteriori approach to multicriteria decision making the idea is to first find a set of interesting (usually non-dominated) decision alternatives and then let the decision maker select among these. Often an additional demand is to limit the size of alternatives to a small number of solutions. In this case, it is important to state preferences on sets. In previous work it has been shown that independent normalization of objective functions (using for instance desirability functions) combined with the hypervolume indicator can be used to formulate such set-preferences. A procedure to compute and to maximize the probability that a set of solutions contains at least one satisfactory solution is established. Moreover, we extend the model to the scenario of multiple decision makers. For this we compute the probability that at least one solution in a given set satisfies all decision makers. First, the information required a-priori from the decision makers is considered. Then, a computational procedure to compute the probability for a single set to contain a solution, which is acceptable to all decision makers, is introduced. Thereafter, we discuss how the computational effort can be reduced and how the measure can be maximized. Practical examples for using this in database queries will be discussed, in order to show how this approach relates to applications. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
Introduction Despite the increasing use of domestic social robots by older adults, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding attitudes, concerns, and potential adoption behavior in this population. This study aims to categorize older adults into distinct technology adoption groups based on their attitudes toward domestic social robots and their behavior in using the existing technology.Methods An exploratory qualitative research design was used, involving semi-structured interviews with 24 retired Slovenian older adults aged 65 years or older, conducted between 26 June and 14 September 2023.Results Four distinct groups of older adults were identified: (1) Cautious Optimists, (2) Skeptical Traditionalists, (3) Positive Optimists, and (4) Technophiles based on eight characteristics.Discussion These groups can be aligned with the categories of the Diffusion of Innovation Theory. Privacy and security concerns, influenced by varying levels of familiarity with the technology, pose barriers to adoption. Perceived utility and ease of use vary considerably between groups, highlighting the importance of taking into account the different older adults. The role of social influence in the adoption process is complex, with some groups being more receptive to external opinions, while others exhibit more autonomous decision-making.
Captchas are a standard defense on commercial websites against undesirable or malicious Internet bot programs, but widely deployed schemes can be broken with simple but novel attacks. Applying security engineering expertise to the design of Captchas can significantly improve their robustness.
This paper analyzes the correlates of traditional (burglary, vehicle theft, theft from vehicles, and pickpocketing) and online property crime (data theft and online fraud), with particular attention given to the relation between them and the risk of multiple victimizations. Data are gathered from a large and representative victimization survey conducted in a Swiss city (N = 7,885). The findings suggest that both traditional and online property victimization are related positively to the participants' lifestyle routines, physical and online protection measures, and educational level. Men, young persons, those employed actively, and university graduates are overrepresented among the multiple victims of online-offline property victimization.
Electromyogram (EMG) signals provide valuable insights into the muscles' activities supporting the different hand movements, but their analysis can be challenging due to their stochastic nature, noise, and non-stationary variations in the signal. We are pioneering the use of a unique combination of wavelet scattering transform (WST) and attention mechanisms adopted from recent sequence modelling developments of deep neural networks for the classification of EMG patterns. Our approach utilizes WST, which decomposes the signal into different frequency components, and then applies a non-linear operation to the wavelet coefficients to create a more robust representation of the extracted features. This is coupled with different variations of attention mechanisms, typically employed to focus on the most important parts of the input data by considering weighted combinations of all input vectors. By applying this technique to EMG signals, we hypothesized that improvement in the classification accuracy could be achieved by focusing on the correlation between the different muscles' activation states associated with the different hand movements. To validate the proposed hypothesis, the study was conducted using three commonly used EMG datasets collected from various environments based on laboratory and wearable devices. This approach shows significant improvement in myoelectric pattern recognition (PR) compared to other methods, with average accuracies of up to 98%.
Since the advent of the Internet, right-wing extremists and those who subscribe to extreme right views have exploited online platforms to build a collective identity among the like-minded. Research in this area has largely focused on extremists' use of websites, forums, and mainstream social media sites, but overlooked in this research has been an exploration of the popular social news aggregation site Reddit. The current study explores the role of Reddit's unique voting algorithm in facilitating othering discourse and, by extension, collective identity formation among members of a notoriously hateful subreddit community, r/The_Donald. The results of the thematic analysis indicate that those who post extreme-right content on r/The_Donald use Reddit's voting algorithm as a tool to mobilize like-minded members by promoting extreme discourses against two prominent out-groups: Muslims and the Left. Overall, r/The_Donald's sense of community facilitates identity work among its members by creating an environment wherein extreme right views are continuously validated.
Previous studies on fighting computer-assisted frauds have attempted to assist law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to better understand important aspects of motivation, opportunity and deterrence. However, there have been few empirical studies on the profiles of convicted offenders, post detection. This paper examines characteristics of frauds and their associated respective law enforcement response with particular emphasis on frauds facilitated by information technology. The findings show how the prosecution and conviction of the offenders differ among commonly-seen types of computer assisted frauds, and bring new evidence to the common association of gender and crime, severity and punishment, etc. The findings may help LEAs and legislative bodies to evaluate their current practices from the point of restorative social justice.
Cyberbullying has grown into a global issue with the Internet becoming a readily accessible commodity around the world. During the outbreak and spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), most personal and professional activities shifted to the virtual environment, increasing the time children spent online and the opportunities to engage in deviant behavior such as cyberbullying. In this paper, we analyzed cyberbullying data drawn from a nationally representative survey of South Korean adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correlates of cyberbullying perpetration were examined in addition to the moderating impact of parental support. Policy implications and future research directions were discussed based on the findings.
We investigate the problem of creating ambiguous file system partitions, i.e., the possibility to have two fully functional file systems within a single file system partition. The problem is different from steganographic data hiding since there is no real distinction between content and cover data, and no translation process may be applied to the content data. Since typical file systems that occur in forensic analysis are usually unambiguous, ambiguous file system partitions may be useful corner cases in forensic tools and processes. We show that it is possible to create ambiguous file system partitions by integrating a guest file system into the structures of a host file system in two cases: We integrate a fully functional FAT32 into Ext3 and HFS+. In a third example we even integrate two guest file systems (HFS+ and FAT32) into a single Btrfs file system partition. We test common forensic tools on these examples and exhibit some deficiencies. Moreover, we develop a taxonomy of ambiguous file system partitions and argue that the existence of essential data at fixed positions still is a way to distinguish host from guest and so to heuristically reduce the ambiguity, without removing it completely.

Internet can be misused by cyber criminals as a platform to conduct illegitimate activities (such as harassment, cyber bullying, and incitement of hate or violence) anonymously. As a result, authorship analysis of anonymous texts in Internet (such as emails, forum comments) has attracted significant attention in the digital forensic and text mining communities. The main problem is a large number of possible of authors, which hinders the effective identification of a true author. We interpret open class author attribution as a process of expert recommendation where the decision support system returns a list of suspected authors for further analysis by forensics experts rather than a single prediction result, thus reducing the scale of the problem. We describe the task formally and present algorithms for constructing the suspected author list. For evaluation we propose using a simple Winner-Takes-All (WTA) metric as well as a set of gain-discount model based metrics from the information retrieval domain (mean reciprocal rank, discounted cumulative gain and rank-biased precision). We also propose the List Precision (LP) metric as an extension of WTA for evaluating the usability of the suspected author list. For experiments, we use our own dataset of Internet comments in Lithuanian language and consider the use of language-specific (Lithuanian) lexical features together with general lexical features derived from English language. For classification we use one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results of experiments show that the usability of open class author attribution can be improved considerably by using a set of language-specific lexical features together with general lexical features, while the proposed method can be used to reduce the number of suspected authors thus alleviating the work of forensic linguists.
In addition to hosting user-generated video content, YouTube provides recommendation services, where sets of related and recommended videos are presented to users, based on factors such as co-visitation count and prior viewing history. This article is specifically concerned with extreme right (ER) video content, portions of which contravene hate laws and are thus illegal in certain countries, which are recommended by YouTube to some users. We develop a categorization of this content based on various schema found in a selection of academic literature on the ER, which is then used to demonstrate the political articulations of YouTube's recommender system, particularly the narrowing of the range of content to which users are exposed and the potential impacts of this. For this purpose, we use two data sets of English and German language ER YouTube channels, along with channels suggested by YouTube's related video service. A process is observable whereby users accessing an ER YouTube video are likely to be recommended further ER content, leading to immersion in an ideological bubble in just a few short clicks. The evidence presented in this article supports a shift of the almost exclusive focus on users as content creators and protagonists in extremist cyberspaces to also consider online platform providers as important actors in these same spaces.
An insider threat can take on many forms and fall under different categories. This includes malicious insider, careless/unaware/uneducated/naive employee, and the third-party contractor. Machine learning techniques have been studied in published literature as a promising solution for such threats. However, they can be biased and/or inaccurate when the associated dataset is hugely imbalanced. Therefore, this article addresses the insider threat detection on an extremely imbalanced dataset which includes employing a popular balancing technique known as spread subsample. The results show that although balancing the dataset using this technique did not improve performance metrics, it did improve the time taken to build the model and the time taken to test the model. Additionally, the authors realised that running the chosen classifiers with parameters other than the default ones has an impact on both balanced and imbalanced scenarios, but the impact is significantly stronger when using the imbalanced dataset.
This study examines darknet markets through the lens of a business theory on knowledge management. Taking epistemological and ontological dimensions into consideration, this study uses Nonaka's (1991) SECI model as a theoretical framework to identify and describe how tacit and explicit knowledge is created and shared on Silk Road, Pandora and Agora darknet markets, and how people affect this process. By studying this process, insights can be obtained into darknet market criminal organizations and communities of practice and their impact on the continuity and resilience of illicit darknet markets. This project used data from the Internet Archive collection of publicly available darknet market scrapes between 2011 and 2015 from Branwen et al. (2015). We observed instances of the SECI model (socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) on darknet markets in both criminal organizations and communities of practice. Darknet market leaders and groups facilitated both knowledge creation and sharing. This study is the first to test the SECI model on darknet markets. The study provides an understanding of the complexity and resilience of darknet markets, as well as valuable information to help guide law enforcement agencies efforts to stop the illicit trade of goods and services.
"The current study explored the effect of a school-based intervention on online risk awareness and behavior in order to shed light on a relatively unexplored field with high practical relevance. More than 800 Belgium primary school children (grade 4 and 6) were assessed at two measurements (n T1 = 812, 51.2 % female; n T2 = 819, 51.3 % female) before and after the intervention. Half of them received a 10 min classroom intervention indicating online risks. Children in the control group received a 10 min presentation concerning online applications without any emphasis on risks. Children in the intervention group were more likely to be aware of online risks directly after the intervention; this effect was still noticeable 4 months after. Reporting of online risk behavior in the intervention group was also higher compared to the control group who did not receive the intervention. Overall online risk awareness and online risk behavior were negatively associated and the awareness did not modulate the association between the intervention and online risk behavior. Furthermore, individual differences were assessed. Girls were more likely to be aware of online risks and asserted less online risk behavior than boys were. In line with the imperative in adolescence to become more risk taking, children in a higher grade were more likely to behave in a risky manner when online. The current study provides a valuable starting point for further research on how to decrease online risk behavior in early adolescence."
Due to recent advances in pose-estimation methods, human motion can be extracted from a common video in the form of 3D skeleton sequences. Despite wonderful application opportunities, effective and efficient content-based access to large volumes of such spatio-temporal skeleton data still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based text-to-motion retrieval task, which aims at retrieving relevant motions based on a specified natural-language textual description. To define baselines for this uncharted task, we employ the BERT and CLIP language representations to encode the text modality and successful spatio-temporal models to encode the motion modality. We additionally introduce our transformer-based approach, called Motion Transformer (MoT), which employs divided space-time attention to effectively aggregate the different skeleton joints in space and time. Inspired by the recent progress in text-to-image/video matching, we experiment with two widely-adopted metric-learning loss functions. Finally, we set up a common evaluation protocol by defining qualitative metrics for assessing the quality of the retrieved motions, targeting the two recently-introduced KIT Motion-Language and HumanML3D datasets. The code for reproducing our results is available here: https://github.com/mesnico/text-to-motion-retrieval.
The quality of the extracted traditional hand-crafted Electromyogram (EMG) features has been recently identified in the literature as a limiting factor prohibiting the translation from laboratory to clinical settings. To address this limitation, a shift of focus from traditional feature extraction methods to deep learning models was witnessed, as the latter can learn the best feature representation for the task at hand. However, while deep learning models achieve promising results based on raw EMG data, their clinical implementation is often challenged due to their significantly high computational costs (significantly large number of generated models' parameters and a huge amount of data needed for training). This paper is focused on combining the simplicity and low computational characteristics of traditional feature extraction with the memory concepts from Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to efficiently extract the spatial-temporal dynamics of the EMG signals. The novelty of the proposed method can be summarized in a) the memory concept leveraged from deep learning structures, capturing short-term temporal dependencies of the EMG signals, b) the use of cardinality to generate logical combinations of spatially distinct EMG signals and as a feature extraction method and 3) low computational costs and the enhanced classification performance. The performance of the proposed method is validated using three EMG databases collected with 1) laboratory hardware (9 transradial amputees and 17 intact-limbed), and 2) wearables (22 intact-limed using two wearable consumer armbands). In comparison to several other well-known methods from the literature, the proposed method shows significantly enhanced myoelectric pattern recognition performance, with accuracies reaching up to 99%.
Phishing emails are becoming more and more sophisticated, making current detection techniques ineffective. The reporting of phishing emails from users is, thus, crucial for organizations to detect phishing attacks and mitigate their effect. Despite extensive research on how the believability of a phishing email affects detection rates, there is little to no research about the relationship between the believability of a phishing email and the associated reporting rate. In this work, we present a controlled experiment with 446 subjects to evaluate how the reporting rate of a phishing email is linked to its believability and detection rate. Our results show that the reporting rate decreases as the believability of the email increases and that around half of the subjects who detect the mail as phishing, have an intention to report the email. However, the group intending to report an email is not a subset of the group detecting the mail as phishing, suggesting that reporting is still a concept misunderstood by many.
Social networking sites are increasingly subject to malicious activities such as self-propagating worms, confidence scams and drive-by-download malwares. The high number of users associated with the presence of sensitive data, such as personal or professional information, is certainly an unprecedented opportunity for attackers. These attackers are moving away from previous platforms of attack, such as emails, towards social networking websites. In this paper, we present a full stack methodology for the identification of campaigns of malicious profiles on social networking sites, composed of maliciousness classification, campaign discovery and attack profiling. The methodology named REPLOT, for REtrieving Profile Links On Twitter, contains three major phases. First, profiles are analysed to determine whether they are more likely to be malicious or benign. Second, connections between suspected malicious profiles are retrieved using a late data fusion approach consisting of temporal and authorship analysis based models to discover campaigns. Third, the analysis of the discovered campaigns is performed to investigate the attacks. In this paper, we apply this methodology to a real world dataset, with a view to understanding the links between malicious profiles, their attack methods and their connections. Our analysis identifies a cluster of linked profiles focusing on propagating malicious links, as well as profiling two other major clusters of attacking campaigns.
Objective The purpose of the current research was to examine the predictors of cyberbullying victimization among South Korean students during a period in which the coronavirus disease was spreading worldwide. We assessed whether parental guardianship protected against victimization when most people worked from home and school instructions were shifted to online learning. Methods We analyzed nationally representative data collected between October 6 and November 13, 2020. Binary logistic regression models were developed based on the Routine Activities Theory theoretical model to investigate the correlates of cyberbullying victimization among participants. Results The results showed that respondents' routine online activities were closely related to victimization, and parental guardianship provided partial protection by reducing non-violent victimization. Conclusion Parents could play a critical role in protecting children from cyberbullying victimization. Future research should continue to investigate the impact of parenting on reducing cyberbullying victimization, specifically the effects of different parenting styles and protections.
Finitary monads on Pos are characterized as precisely the free-algebra monads of varieties of algebras. These are classes of ordered algebras specified by inequations in context. Analogously, finitary enriched monads on Pos are characterized: here we work with varieties of coherent algebras which means that their operations are monotone.
Using representative survey data from Canada, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and five European Union member countries (n = 9,011), this paper predicts the use of privacy-enhancing technologies and techniques as a form of individual target hardening behavior. It presents a novel extension of routine activity theory by revisiting the theory from the perspective of Internet users in their efforts to minimize their likelihood of victimization. The results show that perceived concern and exposure to certain motivated offenders leads to target hardening behaviors, such as using two-factor authentication and antivirus software. Encryption communication services, however, were not associated with concern for any combination of motivated offenders. Moreover, perceived deficiencies in governmental but not company guardianship predicted new protective behaviors.
"By reframing the theoretical relationship between the notions of privacy/data protection and security, the paper examines how and to what extent enforcing the right to the protection of personal data can improve the security of the cyberspace. It pays special attention to the implementation of the principle/approach of data protection by-design, which concerns the adoption of relevant and ad hoc privacy-enforcing technical, technological or organizational solutions in the design specifications and architecture of systems and processes. This principle is nowadays formally endorsed by the European Union data protection legal framework. It is binding and directly applicable in all the EU Member States. Its implementation by relevant cyberspace's stakeholders is both a challenge and an opportunity; the latter is particularly true as per the implications that the by-design approach generates with respect to the enhancement of cybersecurity. However, to be effective and have a significant positive impact on the European societies and their members - both in terms of improved safeguards for privacy and better promotion of cybersecurity, the implementation of the data protection by-design approach should become a cultural element. It should permeate individuals and organisations' beliefs, attitudes and behaviour."
Cybersecurity professionals need hands-on training to prepare for managing the current advanced cyber threats. To practice cybersecurity skills, training participants use numerous software tools in computer-supported interactive learning environments to perform offensive or defensive actions. The interaction involves typing commands, communicating over the network, and engaging with the training environment. The training artifacts (data resulting from this interaction) can be highly beneficial in educational research. For example, in cybersecurity education, they provide insights into the trainees' learning processes and support effective learning interventions. However, this research area is not yet well-understood. Therefore, this paper surveys publications that enhance cybersecurity education by leveraging trainee-generated data from interactive learning environments. We identified and examined 3021 papers, ultimately selecting 35 articles for a detailed review. First, we investigated which data are employed in which areas of cybersecurity training, how, and why. Second, we examined the applications and impact of research in this area, and third, we explored the community of researchers. Our contribution is a systematic literature review of relevant papers and their categorization according to the collected data, analysis methods, and application contexts. These results provide researchers, developers, and educators with an original perspective on this emerging topic. To motivate further research, we identify trends and gaps, propose ideas for future work, and present practical recommendations. Overall, this paper provides in-depth insight into the recently growing research on collecting and analyzing data from hands-on training in security contexts.
Cybersecurity education and training are essential prerequisites of achieving a secure and privacy-friendly digital environment. Both professionals and the general public widely acknowledge the need for high-quality university education programs and professional training courses. However, guides, recommendations, practical tools, and good examples that could help institutions design appropriate cybersecurity programs are still missing. In particular, a comprehensive method to identify skills needed by cybersecurity work roles offered on the job market is missing. This paper aims to provide practical tools and strategies to help higher education providers design good cybersecurity curricula. First, we analyze the content of 89 existing study programs worldwide, collect recommendations of renowned institutions within and outside the EU, and provide a comprehensive survey accompanied by a dynamic web application called Education Map. Based on the knowledge about the current state in cybersecurity education, we design the SPARTA Cybersecurity Skills Framework that provides the currently missing link between work roles and required expertise and shows how to develop a curriculum that reflects job market requirements. Finally, we provide a practical tool that implements the framework and helps education and training providers design new study programs and analyze existing ones by considering the requirements of cybersecurity work roles.
The opioid epidemic, impacted from the proliferation of fentanyl, has added impetus to the need to detect fentanyl, sources of fentanyl, and places where fentanyl and drugs adulterated with fentanyl are available. Many darknet marketplaces (DNMs) have rules that ban fentanyl. However, it is unclear how these affect the fentanyl market. Using the AlphaBay DNM as a case study, we conducted mixed methods qualitative research. We scraped and analyzed data from the AlphaBay I2P website using, among other methods, content and social network analysis, to uncover hidden fentanyl networks. Our research highlights the next evolution of darknet marketplaces - the migration of DNMs from Tor to I2P and the methods that can be used identify fentanyl networks, irrespective of where sites are: I2P, Tor, or multihomed on I2P and Tor. Despite its ban in the Global AlphaBay Rules, our research revealed the sale of fentanyl on the AlphaBay DNM. Unlike previous studies, our findings predominantly revealed the covert sale of fentanyl on AlphaBay and predatory vendors selling illicit drugs, which unbeknownst to buyers, contained fentanyl. To a lesser extent, our findings identified the overt sale of fentanyl patches on AlphaBay. Although we examined only one DNM, the prevalence of the covert sale of fentanyl and the presence of predatory vendors underscores the importance of research that decodes the language of vendors who surreptitiously sell fentanyl or drugs adulterated with fentanyl or other illicit substances. The results of our research can inform strategies aimed at disrupting and dismantling DNM fentanyl networks.
The foci of the present study are to estimate the extent of cyberstalking victimization, and develop, specify, and test a theoretically based model of cyberstalking victimization among college women. A pursuit- and fear-based measure of victimization was utilized, and three leading theories-self-control, opportunity, and control balance-were tested as explanations of cyberstalking victimization. Key concepts from each theoretical perspective were operationalized using primary survey data from a probability sample of college women (N = 1,987) from two large universities. Results show that approximately 3.4% of female students were victims of cyberstalking during the academic year. Findings from a path model revealed significant direct effects for opportunity and having a control deficit on cyberstalking. The effects of self-control were indirect through these two measures, whereas having a control surplus was not related to victimization risk. Overall, findings support the application of these three theoretical approaches to predicting and explaining cyberstalking victimization.
One of the main objectives of this study is to help prioritize targets for law enforcement by analyzing online websites hosting child exploitation material and finding key players within. Key players are defined as websites that display a combination of high connectivity and a lot of hardcore material and would provide the most disruption in a network if they were to be removed. In this study, various strategies based on Principal Component Analysis are presented to identify those nodes that act as the key players in an online child exploitation network. For evaluating the results of these strategies, we consider the results of various attack strategies. The measures for evaluation are the density, clustering coefficient, average path length, diameter, and the number of connected components in the resulting network. The results show that the strategies proposed are more successful at reducing all of the outcome measures than existing strategies.
In Hong Kong, nearly 1,300 women participated by telephone in the International Violence Against Women Survey in 2006. One in five respondents had experienced violence since age 16. Sexual violence (13.4%) was more frequent than physical violence (11.7%). Women were more likely to be abused by men they knew (13.5%) than by strangers (8%). Compared with other surveyed countries, Hong Kong recorded among the lowest rates of violence by both intimate partners and non-partners. These results suggest that cultural influences linked to the interaction of modernization and some protective factors found in the adherence to traditional Chinese values are relevant.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for malware classification. There has been a huge increase in the volume of malware in recent years which poses a serious security threat to financial institutions, businesses and individuals. In order to combat the proliferation of malware, new strategies are essential to quickly identify and classify malware samples so that their behavior can he analyzed. Machine learning approaches are becoming popular for classifying malware, however, most of the existing machine learning methods for malware classification use shallow learning algorithms (e.g. SVM). Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning approach, have shown superior performance compared to traditional learning algorithms, especially in tasks such as image classification. Motivated by this success, we propose a CNN-based architecture to classify malware samples. We convert malware binaries to grayscale images and subsequently train a CNN for classification. Experiments on two challenging malware classification datasets, Malimg and Microsoft malware, demonstrate that our method achieves better than the state-of-the-art performance. The proposed method achieves 98.52% and 99.97% accuracy on the Malimg and Microsoft datasets respectively.
Purpose The purpose of this study is to review the literature on money laundering and its related areas. The main objective is to identify any gaps in the literature and direct attention towards addressing them. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the money laundering literature was conducted with an emphasis on the Pro-Quest, Scopus and Science-Direct databases. Broad research themes were identified after investigating the literature. The theme about the detection of money laundering was then further investigated. The major approaches of such detection are identified, as well as research gaps that could be addressed in future studies. Findings The literature on money laundering can be classified into the following six broad areas: anti-money laundering framework and its effectiveness, the effect of money laundering on other fields and the economy, the role of actors and their relative importance, the magnitude of money laundering, new opportunities available for money laundering and detection of money laundering. Most studies about the detection of money laundering have focused on the use of innovative technologies, banking transactions or real estate- and trade-based money laundering. However, the literature on the detection of shell companies being explicitly used to launder funds is relatively scarce. Originality/value This paper provides insights into an area related to money laundering where research is relatively scant. Shell companies incorporated in the UK alone were identified to be associated with laundering 80bn pound of stolen money between 2010 and 2014. The use of these entities to launder billions of dollars as witnessed through the laundromat schemes and several data leaks clearly indicate the need to focus on illicit financial flows through such entities.
Several system management technologies have been introduced that leverage additional devices on the main board to asynchronously access and control the host's computing resources. One such prominent technology for server systems is the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), a co-processors with some firmware that allows an administrator to monitor and administer a server remotely. This paper introduces BMCLeech, the first software that brings forensic memory acquisition onto the BMC which makes it very useful for incident response teams.

With the arrival of connected and autonomous vehicles, Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communications are promising to facilitate efficient future of mobility on the road by ensuring maximum protection and safety for both drivers and pedestrians. However, this new technology poses new security and privacy challenges that should be taken into account. For instance, a probable malicious node claiming to be a legitimate pedestrian or vehicle within the network can impact the traffic flow, or even cause serious congestion and traffic accidents by broadcasting fake observations or phenomena on the roads. Therefore, it is crucial to identify legitimate vehicles and road users against adversaries pretending to be one. The aim of this paper is to address these issues, by proposing a distributed trust management scheme that relies on blockchain technology and a trust computation approach for efficient and secure management of trust relationships between pedestrians and vehicles in Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) networks.
Applying a random-effect meta-analysis, the current study examines previous empirical findings about three main purposes of Emotional Literacy (EL) correctional programs: improving empathy, mindfulness, and self-regulation among inmate populations. A total of 22 programs in 15 studies in Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the US are analyzed. Results suggest that EL programs significantly improve levels of empathy, mindfulness, and self-regulation, although a possibility of publication bias is observed. Based on these findings, this study concludes that EL programs retain a potential as an effective rehabilitation strategy and should be sought and implemented in U.S. correctional settings.
Breaches of security, a.k.a. security and data breaches, are on the rise, one of the reasons being the well-known lack of incentives to secure services and their underlying technologies, such as cloud computing. In this article, I question whether the patchwork of six EU instruments addressing breaches is helping to prevent or mitigate breaches as intended. At a lower level of abstraction, the question concerns appraising the success of each instrument separately. At a higher level of abstraction, since all laws converge on the objective of network and information security - one of the three pillars of the EU cyber security policy - the question is whether the legal 'patchwork' is helping to 'patch' the underlying insecurity of network and information systems thus contributing to cyber security. To answer the research question, I look at the regulatory framework as a whole, from the perspective of network and information security and consequently I use the expression cyber security breaches. I appraise the regulatory patchwork by using the three goals of notification identified by the European Commission as a benchmark, enriched by policy documents, legal analysis, and academic literature on breaches legislation, and I elaborate my analysis by reasoning on the case of cloud computing. The analysis, which is frustrated by the lack of adequate data, shows that the regulatory framework on cyber security breaches may be failing to provide the necessary level of mutual learning on the functioning of security measures, awareness of both regulatory authorities and the public on how entities fare in protecting data (and the related network and information systems), and enforcing self-improvement of entities dealing with information and services. I conclude with some recommendations addressing the causes, rather than the symptoms, of network and information systems insecurity. (C) 2018 Maria Grazia Porcedda. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Democracy requires transparency. Consequently, courts of law must publish their decisions. At the same time, the interests of the persons involved in these court decisions must be protected. For this reason, court decisions in Europe are anonymized using a variety of techniques. To understand how well these techniques protect the persons involved, we conducted an empirical experiment with 54 law students, whom we asked to de-anonymize 50 German court decisions. We found that all anonymization techniques used in these court decisions were vulnerable, most notably the use of initials. Since even supposedly secure anonymization techniques proved vulnerable, our work empirically reveals the complexity involved in the anonymization of court decisions, and thus calls for further research to increase anonymity while preserving comprehensibility. Toward that end, we provide recommendations for improving anonymization quality. Finally, we provide an empirical notion of reasonable effort, to flesh out the definition of anonymity in the legal context. In doing so, we bridge the gap between the technical and the legal understandings of anonymity.
Research summaryDarknet marketplaces (DNMs) are global digital marketplaces used primarily to buy and sell illicit drugs online. High rates of adulterated substances have contributed to the creation of harm reduction policies by DNM administrators to address growing rates of overdose worldwide. This paper explores the extent to which harm reduction occurs in buyer feedback of Adderall and Oxycodone purchased on AlphaBay and how these comments are impacted by AlphaBay's administrator-led harm reduction policy. This study finds that harm reduction strategies are present in buyer feedback of Oxycodone and Adderall pills, but AlphaBay's policy has very little impact on the preexisting harm reduction communication within buyer feedback.Policy implicationsInternational policy proposals have placed emphasis on addressing the overdose crisis through harm reduction programs that provide people who use drugs with the necessary services and resources to buy and use drugs safely. There have been very few proposals that have considered how these programs can address the unique setting of buying and using drugs purchased on DNMs. Communication occurring among DNM buyers reveals how harm reduction strategies are being employed by users purchasing drugs from DNMs. In particular, these findings offer insight into the shared experiences of drug buyers in anonymous settings and the strategies they are using to protect one another from overdose and other unwanted side effects often caused by adulterated substances. Understanding these strategies highlights the ways in which street-based harm reduction programs can extend their services to online environments to assist buyers with making safe and informed decisions when using substances purchased online.
The article is devoted to the study of the problems of polygraphic research to obtain forensically significant infounation. An analysis of the legal basis for the use of the polygraph in Ukraine. Problematic issues concerning the appropriateness of using a polygraph in the investigation and detection of crimes have been studied. The domestic legal norms that regulate this issue, as well as foreign experience are analyzed. The article reveals the essence of the polygraph, the legal basis and requirements for its use. Attention is drawn to the main difficulties of using a polygraph and ways to solve them.
Phishing attacks are increasingly more sophisticated, with attackers exploiting publicly available information on their targets to personalize their attacks. Although an increasing body of research has investigated the effectiveness of tailored phishing campaigns, researchers have primarily focused on large enterprises. Company size, composition, and resource availability (e.g., of security experts or a phishing response team handling incidents) play an important role in the studied dynamics. However, whether the same also applies to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which typically do not have those resources, is unclear. On the other hand, studying SME security is hard as they generally have no expertise in-house to run the required experiments. This work provides a first study filling this gap by investigating the effectiveness of tailored phishing campaigns against an SME IT company in Europe. To this end, we conducted a field experiment targeting 30 employees at an SME and, subsequently, interviewed nine employees to understand the cognitive processes underlying the detection and response of our phishing campaign as well as the group defense mechanisms at the SME. Our findings show that expectation mismatch was the primary method for detecting our phishing email and that the collective defense mechanism enabled a surprisingly prompt response and containment of the attack, possibly, due to the network dynamics of a small company.
End users present a key challenge for the protection of contemporary information security systems. The manipulation of people through deceit to gain access to sensitive information and otherwise secure systems is known to hackers, information security practitioners, and other technologists as social engineering. To date, little research has investigated the attributes that people who engage in such deception - so-called social engineers - associate with vulnerable targets. To address this gap, this study engages in a grounded theory-based analysis of interviews with nonprofessional and professional social engineers. The results describe six attributes of a model victim for social engineers, a hypothetical person considered particularly susceptible to social engineering deceptions: (1)prized, (2)uninformed, (3)unconcerned, (4)outgoing, (5)connected, and (6)controlled. Additionally, this study describes heuristic categories described by participants to help make decisions about target vulnerability which include targetsocio-demographic characteristics, social roles, andorganizational positions. Implications for theory, future research, and policy are considered.
In this work we study, design, and evaluate computational methods to support interpretation of statutory terms. We propose a novel task of discovering sentences for argumentation about the meaning of statutory terms. The task models the analysis of past treatment of statutory terms, an exercise lawyers routinely perform using a combination of manual and computational approaches. We treat the discovery of sentences as a special case of ad hoc document retrieval. The specifics include retrieval of short texts (sentences), specialized document types (legal case texts), and, above all, the unique definition of document relevance provided in detailed annotation guidelines. To support our experiments we assembled a data set comprising 42 queries (26,959 sentences) which we plan to release to the public in the near future in order to support further research. Most importantly, we investigate the feasibility of developing a system that responds to a query with a list of sentences that mention the term in a way that is useful for understanding and elaborating its meaning. This is accomplished by a systematic assessment of different features that model the sentences' usefulness for interpretation. We combine features into a compound measure that accounts for multiple aspects. The definition of the task, the assembly of the data set, and the detailed task analysis provide a solid foundation for employing a learning-to-rank approach.
Capture the Flag games represent a popular method of cybersecurity training. Providing meaningful insight into the training progress is essential for increasing learning impact and supporting participants' motivation, especially in advanced hands-on courses. In this paper, we investigate how to provide valuable post-game feedback to players of serious cybersecurity games through interactive visualizations. In collaboration with domain experts, we formulated user requirements that cover three cognitive perspectives: gameplay overview, person-centric view, and comparative feedback. Based on these requirements, we designed two interactive visualizations that provide complementary views on game results. They combine a known clustering and time-based visual approaches to show game results in a way that is easy to decode for players. The purposefulness of our visual feedback was evaluated in a usability field study with attendees of the Summer School in Cyber Security. The evaluation confirmed the adequacy of the two visualizations for instant post-game feedback. Despite our initial expectations, there was no strong preference for neither of the visualizations in solving different tasks.
Intrusion detection in computer networks is of great importance because of its effects on the different communication and security domains. The detection of network intrusion is a challenge. Moreover, network intrusion detection remains a challenging task as a massive amount of data is required to train the state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect network intrusion threats. Many approaches have already been proposed recently on network intrusion detection. However, they face critical challenges owing to the continuous increase in new threats that current systems do not understand. This paper compares multiple techniques to develop a network intrusion detection system. Optimum features are selected from the dataset based on the correlation between the features. Furthermore, we propose an AdaBoost-based approach for network intrusion detection based on these selected features and present its detailed functionality and performance. Unlike most previous studies, which employ the KDD99 dataset, we used a recent and comprehensive UNSW-NB 15 dataset for network anomaly detection. This dataset is a collection of network packets exchanged between hosts. It comprises 49 attributes, including nine types of threats such as DoS, Fuzzers, Exploit, Worm, shellcode, reconnaissance, generic, and analysis Backdoor. In this study, we employ SVM and MLP for comparison. Finally, we propose AdaBoost based on the decision tree classifier to classify normal activity and possible threats. We monitored the network traffic and classified it into either threats or non-threats. The experimental findings showed that our proposed method effectively detects different forms of network intrusions on computer networks and achieves an accuracy of 99.3% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The proposed system will be helpful in network security applications and research domains.
PurposeThis study aims to develop a unified theoretical framework that presents a cohesive picture of workplace cyberbullying to better understand the interplay between cyberbullying, its effects on organizations and organizational controls enacted to contain these effects.Design/methodology/approachThe study conducts a theoretical review of the workplace cyberbullying literature between 2005 and 2021 drawing upon existing literature and two important theories, the routine activities theory and control theory. The final sample of 54 empirical papers represents a comprehensive body of literature on cyberbullying published across various disciplines.FindingsA theoretical model of workplace cyberbullying is developed, which highlights major antecedents to workplace cyberbullying and its impact on individual employees as well as organizations.Originality/valueAs firms increasingly rely on information and communication technologies (ICTs), the misuse of ICTs in the form of cyberbullying is also increasing. Workplace cyberbullying severely hurts an organization's employees and compromises the efficacy of its information systems. Fortunately, various controls can be utilized by firms to minimize workplace cyberbullying and its attendant costs. In all, eleven propositions are offered, providing a robust agenda for future research. The authors also offer insights for practitioners on how to minimize cyberbullying in the workplace and its damaging effects.
Currently, the Dark Web is one key platform for the online trading of illegal products and services. Analysing the . onion sites hosting marketplaces is of interest for law enforcement and security researchers. This paper presents a study on 123k listings obtained from 6 different Dark Web markets. While most of current works leverage existing datasets, these are outdated and might not contain new products, e.g., those related to the 2020 COVID pandemic. Thus, we build a custom focused crawler to collect the data. Being able to conduct analyses on current data is of considerable importance as these marketplaces continue to change and grow, both in terms of products offered and users. Also, there are several anti-crawling mechanisms being improved, making this task more difficult and, consequently, reducing the amount of data obtained in recent years on these marketplaces. We conduct a data analysis evaluating multiple characteristics regarding the products, sellers, and markets. These characteristics include, among others, the number of sales, existing categories in the markets, the origin of the products and the sellers. Our study sheds light on the products and services being offered in these markets nowadays. Moreover, we have conducted a case study on one particular productive and dynamic drug market, i.e., Cannazon. Our initial goal was to understand its evolution over time, analyzing the variation of products in stock and their price longitudinally. We realized, though, that during the period of study the market suffered a DDoS attack which damaged its reputation and affected users' trust on it, which was a potential reason which lead to the subsequent closure of the market by its operators. Consequently, our study provides insights regarding the last days of operation of such a productive market, and showcases the effectiveness of a potential intervention approach by means of disrupting the service and fostering mistrust.
Anonymous systems (e.g. anonymous cryptocurrencies and updatable anonymous credentials) often follow a construction template where an account can only perform a single anonymous action, which in turn potentially spawns new (and still single-use) accounts (e.g. UTXO with a balance to spend or session with a score to claim). Due to the anonymous nature of the action, no party can be sure which account has taken part in an action and, therefore, must maintain an ever-growing list of potentially unused accounts to ensure that the system keeps running correctly. Consequently, anonymous systems constructed based on this common template are seemingly not sustainable. In this work, we study the sustainability of ring-based anonymous systems, where a user performing an anonymous action is hidden within a set of decoy users, traditionally called a ring. On the positive side, we propose a general technique for ring-based anonymous systems to achieve sustainability. Along the way, we define a general model of decentralised anonymous systems (DAS) for arbitrary anonymous actions, and provide a generic construction which provably achieves sustainability. As a special case, we obtain the first construction of anonymous cryptocurrencies achieving sustainability without compromising availability. We also demonstrate the generality of our model by constructing sustainable decentralised anonymous social networks. On the negative side, we show empirically that Monero, one of the most popular anonymous cryptocurrencies, is unlikely to be sustainable without altering its current ring sampling strategy. The main subroutine is a sub-quadratic-time algorithm for detecting used accounts in a ring-based anonymous system.
Taxonomies and ontologies are handy tools in many application domains such as knowledge systematization and automatic reasoning. In the cyber security field, many researchers have proposed such taxonomies and ontologies, most of which were built based on manual work. Some researchers proposed the use of computing tools to automate the building process, but mainly on very narrow sub -areas of cyber security. Thus, there is a lack of general cyber security taxonomies and ontologies, possibly due to the difficulties of manually curating keywords and concepts for such a diverse, inter-disciplinary and dynamically evolving field. This paper presents a new human-machine teaming based process to build taxonomies, which allows human experts to work with automated natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tools to co-develop a taxonomy from a set of relevant textual documents. The proposed process could be generalized to support non-textual documents and to build (more complicated) ontologies as well. Using the cyber security as an example, we demonstrate how the proposed taxonomy building process has allowed us to build a general cyber security taxonomy covering a wide range of data-driven keywords (topics) with a reasonable amount of human effort.
We consider the structures of the plane-line and point-line inci-dence matrices of the projective space PG(3 , q) connected with orbits of planes, points, and lines under the stabilizer group of the twisted cubic. In the literature, lines are partitioned into classes, each of which is a union of line orbits. In this paper, for all q , even and odd, we determine the incidence matrices connected with a family of orbits of the class named O6. This class contains lines external to the twisted cubic. The consid-ered family includes an essential part of all O6 orbits, whose complete classification is an open problem.
Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular in modern technology and has been adopted in various application areas. However, researchers have demonstrated that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples in their inputs, which has given rise to a field of research known as adversarial machine learning. Potential adversarial attacks include methods of poisoning datasets by perturbing input samples to mislead machine learning models into producing undesirable results. While such perturbations are often subtle and imperceptible from the perspective of a human, they can greatly affect the performance of machine learning models. This paper presents two methods of verifying the visual fidelity of image-based datasets by using QR codes to detect perturbations in the data. In the first method, a verification string is stored for each image in a dataset. These verification strings can be used to determine whether or not an image in the dataset has been perturbed. In the second method, only a single verification string is stored and can be used to verify whether an entire dataset is intact.y
Recently, smart cities have increasingly been experiencing an evolution to improve the lifestyle of citizens and society. These emerge from the innovation of information and communication technologies (ICT) which are able to create a new economic and social opportunities. However, there are several challenges regarding our security and expectation of privacy. People are already involved and interconnected by using smart phones and other appliances. In many cities, smart energy meters, smart devices, and security appliances have recently been standardized. Full connectivity between public venues, homes, cares, and some other social systems are on their way to be applied, which are known as Internet of Things. In this paper, we aim to enhance the performance of security in smart city communication networks by using a new framework and scheme that provide an authentication and high confidentiality of data. The smart city system can achieve mutual authentication and establish the shared session key schemes between smart meters and the control center in order to secure a two-way communication channel. In our extensive simulation, we investigated and evaluated the security performance of the smart city communication network with and without our proposed scheme in terms of throughput, latency, load, and traffic received packet per seconds. Furthermore, we implemented and applied a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and network intrusion detection system (NIDS) in our proposed technique to validate and measure the security requirements maintaining the constrained resources.
Cyber strategies play a role in combating child sexual abuse material (CSAM). These strategies aim to detect offenders and prevent them from accessing and producing CSAM, or to identify victims. This paper explores five cyber strategies: peer-to-peer network monitoring, automated multi-modal CSAM detection tools, using web crawlers to identify CSAM sites, pop-up warning messages, and facial recognition. This research synthesis captures the background of each strategy, how it works and the evaluative research, along with the benefits, limitations and implementation considerations, offering a practical overview for a broad audience.
Online consumer fraud is one of the most fast-growing crimes. It corresponds to situations where, for instance, the products that are bought, but are not delivered. The present study (N = 1710) aimed at exploring, on the one hand, the predictors of online fraud victimization and, on the other hand, to examine the reporting to the police. Even though 223 were victims of online consumer fraud, only 20 reported to the police. Moreover, while individual variables were not predictors of victimization, online routines were relevant to its explanation. Finally, monetary loss was the most important predictor of reporting to the police.
Due to the nature of mobile systems in which devices change their locations continuously, there is a need for efficient techniques to integrate responses from different agents. Such techniques implement cross-layering service migration models to handle integration issues. This paper proposes a method that aims to model the migration process in an integrated architecture to resolve cross-layering issues, develop a dynamic policy, and optimize the cost of migration in terms of power consumption and communication. The proposed technique extends the Markovian model to adopt the spatiotemporal aspects of this problem, allowing modern 5G vertical appli-cations to communicate seamlessly in highly connected IoT networks. Because of its dynamicity, we propose to project the environmental aspects into the observation part of HMM. We performed experiments to test the performance of the proposed method in terms of efficiency, reliability, and complexity. The results showed a significant performance in the mobile edge computing environment.
With continuously escalating threats and attacks, accurate and timely intrusion detection in communication networks is challenging. Many approaches have already been proposed recently on network intrusion detection. However, they face critical challenges due to the continuous increase of new threats that current systems do not understand. Motivated by the outstanding performance of deep learning (DL) in many detection and recognition tasks, we introduce an intelligent and efficient network intrusion detection system (NIDS) based on DL. This study proposes a non-symmetric deep auto-encoder for network intrusion detection problems and presents its detailed functionality and performance. We validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed NIDS using a benchmark dataset, i.e., KDD CUP'99. Our DL-based method is implemented in the TensorFlow library and GPU framework, and it achieves an accuracy of 99.65%. The proposed system can be used in network security research domains and DL-based detection and classification systems.
Street gangs, by definition, enjoy a special relationship with the street. Prior research shows that some communities are synonymous with gangs and that turf holds a combination of expressive and instrumental value for gang members. As gangs evolve over time and through different levels of organization, however, gangs relationship with the street changes. This shifting street dynamic is underexplored in prior research, thus, drawing on qualitative data from Scotland and Bourdieus theory of social field, the current study presents three cases of gangs at different stages of evolution and examines how levels of gang organization affect spatial relationships. As gangs accumulate sufficient street capital to evolve, we find territory is defined less physically and more relationally, with implications for gang research and practice.
In this paper, we present a combined experimental and analytical investigation of the impact of security compliance on a three-tier web application hosted on a virtualized platform. We used two-group experimental design for our experiments, and analyzed the impact of security using the ANCOVA model. The results of experiments suggest that security measures have significant impact on system performance of web application, particularly on the web and the database tiers. We modeled the three-tier web application using Queueing Network and incorporated security delays in the existing MVA based solution. We compared the results of the experiments with the MVA model results.
This work presents a conceptual proposal to address the problem of intensive human specialized resources that are nowadays required for the maintenance and optimized operation of digital contents filtering in general and anti-spam filtering in particular. The huge amount of spam, malware, virus, and other illegitimate digital contents distributed through network services, represents a considerable waste of physical and technical resources, experts and end users time, in continuous maintenance of anti-spam filters and deletion of spam messages, respectively. The problem of cumbersome and continuous maintenance required to keep anti-spam filtering systems updated and running in an efficient way, is addressed in this work by the means of genetic programming grammatical evolution techniques, for automatic rules generation, having SpamAssassin anti-spam system and SpamAssassin public corpus as the references for the automatic filtering customization.

Accessing online support services can be dangerous for some users, such as domestic abuse survivors. Many support service websites contain quick exit buttons that provide an easy way for users to escape the site. We investigate where exit buttons and other escape mechanisms are currently in use (country and type of site) and how they are implemented. We analyse both the security and usability of exit mechanisms on 323 mobile and 404 desktop sites. We find exit buttons typically replace the current page with another site, occasionally opening additional tabs. Some exit buttons also remove the page from the browser history. When analysing the design choices and shortcomings of exit button implementations, common problems include cookie notices covering the buttons, and buttons not remaining on the screen when scrolling. We provide recommendations for designers of support websites who want to add or improve this feature on their website.
"The smallest possible length of a q-ary linear code of covering radius R and codimension (redundancy) r is called the length function and is denoted by l(q)(r, R). In this work, for q an arbitrary prime power, we obtain the following new constructive upper bounds on l(q)(3t + 1, 3): l(q)(r, 3) (sic) 3 root k . q((r-3)/3) . 3 root ln q, r = 3t + 1, t >= 1, q >= [W(k)], 18 < k <= 20.339, W(k) is a decreasing function of k; l(q)(r, 3) (sic) 3 root 18 . q((r-3)/3) . 3 root ln q, r = 3t + 1, t >= 1, q large enough. For t = 1, we use a one-to-one correspondence between codes of covering radius 3 and codimension 4, and 2-saturating sets in the projective space PG(3, q). A new construction providing sets of small size is proposed. The codes, obtained by geometrical methods, are taken as the starting ones in the lift-constructions (so-called q(m)-concatenating constructions) to obtain infinite families of codes with radius 3 and growing codimension r = 3t+ 1, t >= 1. The new bounds are essentially better than the known ones."
Tampered digital evidence may jeopardize its correct interpretation. To assess the risks in a court of law, it is helpful to quantify the necessary effort to perform a convincing manipulation of digital evidence. Based on a sequence of controlled experiments with graduate students and digital forensics professionals, we study the effort to manipulate copies of main memory taken during a digital investigation. Confirming previous results on hard disc image tampering, manipulating main memory dumps can be considered hard in the sense that most forgeries were successfully detected. However, while the effort to detect a manipulation is generally bounded by the tampering effort, some forgeries fooled the analysts and caused analysis effort that was higher than the manipulation effort. The detection effort by graduate students, however, was generally higher than that of professionals. We study different manipulation and detection approaches and their success. Overall, tampering with main memory dumps appears to be harder than tampering with hard disc images but the probability to fool an analyst is higher too. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Digital forensic investigations has become an important field in this era due to the raise of cybercrimes. Therefore, most governments and companies found the urgent need to invest more in research related to digital forensic investigations. To perform digital forensic investigations covering extraction, analysis, and reporting of digital evidences, new methods and techniques are required. One of these methods used when applying digital forensics on a Windows operating system, is PowerShell. While PowerShell is mainly used to configure, manage and administrate the Windows operating system and other installed programs, this paper will also show that it could be used to collect forensic evidences from a Windows operating system. This paper will discuss Windows PowerShell functions and how they can be beneficiary to a digital forensic investigator. Moreover, the paper will focus on the tools and modules made specifically for forensic investigations. Subsequently, different digital forensic experiments will be conducted using PowerForensics tool in order to extract and identify different Windows forensic artifacts. The results are presented the capabilities of PowerForensics tool to extract forensic evidences from Windows operating system and provide an insight into its limitations.
Industrial control systems (ICSs) are, at present, extremely vulnerable to cyber attack because they are homogenous and interconnected. Mitigating solutions are urgently required because systems breaches can feasibly lead to fatalities. In this paper we propose the deployment of permuted code onto Physically Unclonable Unique Processors in order to resist common cyber attacks. We present our proposal and explain how it would resist attacks from hostile agents.
Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a large number of connected objects that are communicating with each other. In order to support trusted communication between IoT objects, effective authentication procedures should be applied between the communicating entities. In this paper a survey of IoT authentication techniques, which are proposed in the literature, is presented. The survey aims to help other researchers in delving into the details of such techniques by going through their classification and comparison. The classification has been done based on the inherent features of these authentication technique such as being distributed vs. centralized, flat vs. hierarchical, and more others. A comparison between these techniques according to the used evaluation models and their security analysis is illustrated.
Cyber criminals increasingly target Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMEs) since they are perceived to have the weakest defences. Some will not survive a cyber attack, and others will have their ability to continue trading seriously impaired. There is compelling evidence that, at present, SMEs do not seem to be implementing all the advisable security measures which could help them to resist such attacks. Many in the security industry believe that this is because SMEs do not take the threat seriously. This paper reports on a study to find out whether this is the case, or not. The primary finding is that most SMEs do care about the threat but that very few implement even a small subset of the available security precautions. One contributory factor seemed to be the uncertainty caused by the wealth of conflicting and confusing online advice offered by industry and official bodies. This seemed to be hindering rather than helping SMEs so that they did not know what actions to take to improve their resilience. The conclusion is a recommendation for actions to be taken to better inform SMEs and help them to secure their systems more effectively.
Focusing on two of the most common deceptive strategies employed by fraudsters, we assess which type of cue-politeness or urgency-is more likely to result in an email fraud attempt. We also examine whether these cues are mutually exclusive and consistent throughout the progression of a fraud attempt. To answer our research questions, we posted for-sale advertisements on classified-advertisement websites and interacted with fraudsters who responded to our advertisements. Findings reveal that fraud attempts are more likely to follow probe emails that include cues of urgency than cues of politeness. Moreover, although the majority of fraudsters' probe emails include deceptive cues of either politeness or urgency, the majority of subsequent emails include deceptive cues of both politeness and urgency.
In this position paper, we argue for a holistic perspective on threat analysis and other studies of state-sponsored or state-aligned eCrime groups. Specifically, we argue that understanding eCrime requires approaching it as a sociotechnical system and that studying such a system requires combining linguistic, regional, professional, and technical expertise. To illustrate it, we focus on the discourse of the Conti ransomware group in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We discuss the background of this group and their actions and argue that the technical approach alone can lose the important aspects specific to the cultural and linguistic context, such as language, slang and humor. We provide examples of how the discourse and threats from such groups can be easily misunderstood without appropriate linguistic and domain expertise.
Websites typically include many forms or web elements that allow users to enter and submit data. This data will be eventually executed in the back-end databases. Users can, intentionally or unintentionally enter improper input data that, if reach those back-end databases, may cause some serious security or damaging problems. For proper user interface design as well as for security reasons, it is important for web-designers to consider input-validation techniques at the user interface level or as early as possible. The goal is to stop further actions for any invalid input data. In this paper, we conducted an evaluation study of how much input validation is used by web-designers. We used some of the web attacks that target improper input validations as indicators to show the quality of the input validation process for the evaluated websites. Results showed that those types of attacks continue to be effective and serious methods. Results showed also that there is a need for systematic and frequent evaluation for those websites to ensure that basic input validation guidelines are observed. This paper includes the following contributions: An SQL-injection-vulnerability assessment of a dataset of several selected websites, and the proposal of a mutation, fault-based model to test websites for possible SQL-injection vulnerabilities.
"The incorporation of ICT in public sector organisations is progressing rapidly in Oman where the government sees this as a means to enhance the delivery of online services. In this context, preserving the security of information, and making Information Security a core organisational aspect in public sector organisations, requires attention from management. Our research is the first known attempt to gauge management attitudes toward Information Security in Oman. We also consider how such attitudes influence Information Security governance. In addressing these issues, we review current compliance with Information Security procedures in Omani public sector organisations; review management attitudes toward Information Security governance practices; and explore how management attitudes toward Information Security impact upon these aspects."
The nature of today's online communication and the emergence of online social networks have introduced a great challenge related to the identification and the verification of users in web environments. The assumption that every user interact uniquely with a web site provides a baseline for studying user identification based on historical records of user's interactions with specific web site. In this paper, we proposed an approach for using clickstream data to identify users based on their navigational behavior. The study investigates using server-side clickstream data collected from previous users' interaction to create a behavioral profile per user. User's profile can be used to identify possible future interactions, which can be associated with distinguishing authenticated user from malicious user. To accomplish this identification, the ability to gather a historical record for user's navigation in a specific web site, is investigated. The goal of the collected data is to use it for training a model that is able to identify if a future interaction can be associated with a certain user.
Data theft and espionage attacks, which is evolved rapidly, impose the need to develop new and stealthy communication techniques to protect sensitive data that is transferred over the Internet. These new techniques should be built in different way than traditional and known communication techniques, in order to eschew detection and monitoring tools. This paper proposes a new covert channel for stealthy communication. The communication channel uses Least Significant Bit steganography and Tariq port knocking to hide data, besides that GnuPG encryption is applied before hiding the data to add another layer of protection. The communication efficiency has been evaluated using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and the result indicates better image quality compared with other techniques. Also, the maximum capacity and transfer rate of the channel have been evaluated, the channel is capable to achieve 152 bps as a maximum transmission rate in its current implementation.
Cyber-attacks are on the rise due to the increased usage of social networking application's built-in Android devices via Wi-Fi connections, which has resulted in privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted to investigate Android phones, however, none of these have proposed a comprehensive Android investigation method, which begins with a Man-in-the-Middle attack and ending in a criminal investigation. The purpose of this research is to propose an Android forensics framework against such Wi-Fi attacks, using advanced forensic tools, such as the Cellebrite Universal Forensic Extraction Device and the Oxygen. This will assist the researcher to prove the suggested arguments in the following: 1. To implement guidelines for the forensic examiners, especially for those new in the field of forensics, and 2. To guide Android and social networking application developers to enhance the level of security. Furthermore, this study recommends the best data extraction methods designed for Android devices.
"In this study we investigate malicious spam emails in the context of educational institutes. The goal of the study is two folds; first, is to explore spam types of attacks and what their malicious contents may include and secondly, to analyze if these attacks exhibit discriminative characteristics. This study offers an empirical analysis of spam emails dataset and provides a rich set of features that exist in the dataset. The features could then be used by researchers to build new intelligent systems that are capable of classifying and blocking spam emails."
With the advent of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and exploits such as Eurograbber, we can no longer trust the users PC or mobile phone to be honest in their transactions with banks. This paper reviews the current state of the art in protecting PCs from malware and APTs that can modify banking transactions, and identifies their strengths and weaknesses. It then proposes an enhanced USB device based on speech and vision. User trials with a software prototype show that such a device is both user friendly and that users are less susceptible to accepting subtly modified transaction with this device than with other vision only USB devices. Since human factors are usually the weakest point in the security chain, and are often the way that APT actors perform their attacks, the focus of the proposed solution is on improving the usability of existing USB devices. However the device is still not failsafe, and therefore may not be as preferable as Sm@rt TAN-plus that is currently used by many German banks.
In order to identify attacks and malicious behaviors, network packets must be intercepted and analyzed. However, the amount of data logged will be enormous. Trying to process manually this volume of traffic would be massively expensive. This research presents an integrated framework IWNetFAF that captures and analyzes the 802.11 wireless network traffic. IWNetFAF meets the common requirements of a wireless network forensics, namely: capturing wireless network traffic, analyzing the captured traffic according to the investigation's needs, and extracting and documenting digital evidence from the analyzed traffic.
"This paper presents a review of recent academic scholarship and debates on cyber terrorism, and more broadly of what is known about terrorist's direct use of the Internet as weapon and, less directly, as a communication device. It presents an overview of a field of discourse that has, since its inception, provided a number of foreboding and even doomsday warnings about the future of cyber terrorism, which in the main have failed to come to realization. First, it surveys why these gloomy warnings regarding future proliferation of cyber terrorism have not been born out in practice, and explains that rather than looking for instances of the Internet being used directly as a weapon by terrorists, current debates in academic and policy circles have shifted to trying to measure and ascertain the role that the Internet plays in spreading and supporting extremist discourse to ever wider audiences. It continues by posing a series of questions regarding online audiences that are in need of future research if we are to better understand the role of the Internet in spreading and supporting violent extremist discourse and cultivating terrorism; most importantly the role of audiences as autonomous agents in navigating, reacting and responding to online violent extremist materials."
Every day, hundreds of people fly on airline tickets that have been obtained fraudulently. This crime script analysis provides an overview of the trade in these tickets, drawing on interviews with industry and law enforcement, and an analysis of an online blackmarket. Tickets are purchased by complicit travellers or resellers from the online blackmarket. Victim travellers obtain tickets from fake travel agencies or malicious insiders. Compromised credit cards used to be the main method to purchase tickets illegitimately. However, as fraud detection systems improved, offenders displaced to other methods, including compromised loyalty point accounts, phishing, and compromised business accounts. In addition to complicit and victim travellers, fraudulently obtained tickets are used for transporting mules, and for trafficking and smuggling. This research details current prevention approaches, and identifies additional interventions, aimed at the act, the actor, and the marketplace.
"PurposeThis study aims to examine social determinants and social strains of cyberbullying victimization among expatriate populations in high-income countries such as Qatar. The authors argue that expatriate students will be exposed to stains and pressures due to several factors, such as feeling alienated, lonely, homesick, insecure and helpless. This study examines a partial assumption of general strain theory (GST), which posits that expats' cyberbullying victimization can create negative stimuli that lead to negative feelings and, as a result, to delinquent behavior. The delinquent behavior can be seen as a coping method in encountering strains. Logistic regression analysis is applied (using SPSS v. 21) to test the hypothesis that the victimization of expats' cyberbullying could lead to strain and delinquency.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 2,428 expatriate students (46% males and 54% females) was randomly selected from seven public schools in Qatar. The average number of siblings in the household was 2.7. Around 10.8% of the sample reported victimization by cyberbullying. Most came from intact families (80.6%) compared to 19.4 living in broken homes. Concerning the birth order of the student in the family, 25% of the sample were firstborn, and 20% were middle-born. Students' mother relationships were higher than students' father relationships (69% vs 51%, respectively). Fathers were higher in undergraduate education than mothers (60% vs 49%, respectively). Considering that 58% of women did not have a job, most fathers work in administrative positions (47% in administrative work and 39% in professional positions) as opposed to mothers' positions (15% and 21%, respectively). The survey was distributed among expatriate students by trained researchers, teachers and social workers in public schools. The researchers explained the purpose of the study, confidentiality and potential risks and provided directions for completing the survey. Parents and their children provided signed informed consent before participation, following the institutional review boards of Qatar University's Human Subject Research Committee and the Ministry of Social Development. The victimization of cyberbullying is measured at the dichotomy level by asking a general cyberbullying question (In the last 12 months, had you been bullied by other students using mobile messages, email, voice or video messages? Responses were 1 - yes and 0 - no). A definition of cyberbullying was included in the questionnaire. Independent measures are as follows: (1) demographic variables: gender, belief, health, number of friends and exposure to violence; (2) family variables: delinquent family, coercive parenting, family relations, family disputes, father absence and family ties; (3) school variables: school satisfaction, school violence, student fighting, teachers' violence, school truancy and going late to school; (4) imprudent behavior: smoking, alcohol, not using a seat belt, gambling, stealing less than 100 QR, chewing tobacco, stimuli, volatile drugs, sexual harassment, throwing garbage out of the car, cheating, vandalism and victimization.FindingsFindings showed that n = 255, 10.8% of the expats' sample N = 2,428 reported victimization of cyberbullying, of whom 46% were males and 54% were females. A total of 24% of the victims of cyberbullying were males, and 5.8% were females. About a third of the sample were cyberbullying perpetrators (n = 716, 29.5%). Victims of cyberbullying came from intact families (62.4%) compared to broken families (37.6%). A round third of the victims reported the absence of a father during their childhood (n = 78, 31.7%). Most of the victims came from a typical community compared to the delinquent community (71.2% vs 28.2%). About a third of the victims reported it was easy to talk with the father when needed (32% compared to 42.7%), who said it was easy. More than half of the victims do not use seat belts. A low percentage of them were gambling (n = 68, 27% or 2.9% of the total sample). Regarding escaping imprudent and delinquent behaviors, findings showed that a third and more than a tenth of the cyberbullying were smokers and alcoholics (n = 69, 27.4% and n = 42, 16.7% respectively). Moreover, among the most serious, widely spread student problems, around a quarter of the victims reported using chewing tobacco (Sweeka is the local name) (n = 54, 21.4%). Finally, drug use among victims was more than a tenth of them (n = 41, 16.3%). About a quarter of the victims reported stealing less than 100 QR (n = 67, 26.8% or 2.9% of the total sample). Concerning the crimes committed by victims, findings showed that more than forth of them committed assault (n = 71, 28.3%), student fights (n = 202, 80.8%), school violence (n = 117, 46.6%) and half of the victims (50.2%) were also victims of face-to-face bullying. Little below half of the sample was exposed to violence (n = 120, 48.6%) and was the victim of violence in the past 12 months (n = 100, 40.8%). A significant gender differences was found in the victimization of cyberbullying (1 = yes, 0 = no) (a = 000). Moreover, significant mean differences were found between expatriates student victimization of cyberbullying at (a = 000) in all strain variables. Using binary regression analysis to examine the equality of probability of being a victim of cyberbullying as accounted for by the independent variables, the model's predictability was 89.4%. The Hosmer and Lemeshow test and omnibus tests support the model's fit (a = 000). Nagelkerke R2 shows that the stain variables accounted for 24% of the variance in the expat's student victimization of cyberbullying.Research limitations/implicationsConceptualization and determination of what constitutes cyberbullying from the criminal law perspective are needed. Cyberbullying is defined as a form of violence and crime involving new technologies (Sun et al., 2016, p. 62). Policymakers should provide accessible and equitable access to the criminal justice system, the integration of expatriates and the provision of support services to avoid delinquency.Practical implicationsA social cohesion, inclusion and well-being policy is needed for expatriate students and their families in Qatar. In particular, cultural diversity policy and programs, a source of strength and enrichment should be promoted in educational settings. Social inclusion and cultural diversity programs could ease the alienation and marginalization that expatriate students may encounter in their host societies to prevent stains and negative emotions that lead to delinquency and criminal behaviors. Access to support services without discrimination to avoid health and psychological strains and risk factors. This includes but is not limited to avoidance of stigmatization, embarrassment, sense of helplessness, humiliation and other negative feelings toward expatriates. Awareness and promotion of cultural diversity values are needed to enhance cultural acceptance to reduce victimization among the expatriate population. Criminal law and security implications conceptualization and determination of what constitutes cyberbullying from the criminal law perspective are needed. Cyberbullying is a form of violence and crime involving new technologies (Sun et al., 2016). Policymakers should provide accessible and equitable access to the criminal justice system, integrating expatriates and providing support services to avoid delinquency. There is a pressing need for further research within the realm of crime and law to establish the precise legal boundaries surrounding cyberbullying and to delineate the potential scope for legislative measures aimed at safeguarding against victimization in Qatar. Although the state of Qatar has taken steps to address cyberbullying by incorporating it into relevant legal frameworks, there remains a gap in terms of specifically targeting cyberbullying involving children and adolescents. Despite the introduction of the new Cybercrime Prevention Law, the issue of cyberbullying among these vulnerable groups is not adequately addressed.Social implicationsSocial implication includes but is not limited to avoidance of stigmatization, embarrassment, sense of helplessness, humiliation and other negative feelings towards expatriate. Awareness and promotion of cultural diversity values is needed to enhance cultural acceptance to reduce victimization among expatriate population.Originality/valueThe present study examines some strain theory assumptions and the victimization of the cyberbullying expatriate population. This study tests a partial assumption of GST, which states that the expatriate population's exposure to the victimization of cyberbullying can lead to negative stimuli that, in return, create negative feelings and, as a result, imprudent and delinquent behavior. The cyberbullying behavior can be seen as an escaping and coping method in encountering strains. This study underscores the presence of cyberbullying within high schools among expatriate students, exerting significant effects on their personal, social and emotional behaviors. The novel insights gleaned from this investigation contribute substantively to the comprehension of both the pervasiveness and repercussions of cyberbullying on the well-being of expatriate students. This contribution is particularly vital, given the dearth of research in the field, largely attributable to the growing dependence of students on the internet for various cyber activities. This study examines a partial assumption of GST (in non-Western country). Moreover, it uses an advanced statistical analysis and large sample."
Extant research on the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying pays little attention to the role of perpetrator traits in influencing workplace cyberbullying, as well as the unique occurrence context that distinguishes workplace cyberbullying with juvenile cyberbullying, workplace bullying, and adult cyberbullying in general. To fill these gaps, we consider the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying under the theoretical lens of the general theory of crime and routine activities theory. We build a model incorporating low self-control, a widely discussed perpetrator trait in criminology theories, with three types of routine activities representing the unique occurrence context for workplace cyberbullying-mWork, boundary-spanning in enterprise social media, and proactive email checking. We tested our model with 2025 employees in the United States. Our findings demonstrate that low self-control and the three routine activities are strong motivators for workplace cyberbullying. Our findings further show that the effect of low self-control on workplace cyberbullying is amplified by the three routine activities. The study contributes to our understanding of why workplace cyberbullying occurs and offers potential implications for managers interested in reducing incidences of workplace cyberbullying in their organization.
Cloud computing has become the norm in the provisioning of computing resources due to its flexible and proven reliability. Businesses perceive cloud services as a trend that presents enormous possibilities both in economic and technical terms. The growth in cloud services have also increased bottlenecks and security risks to business assets. Cloud security monitoring has remained relatively unexplored in security terms, a factor that has led businesses to be oblivious on the metrics to capture and the appropriate techniques to use. In this paper, we explore security monitoring in terms of tracking specific user requirements based on a case study. We identify various security tools that are practically relevant for addressing the requirements, and devise selection criteria for choosing the best tools. We present an evaluation of the tools and present a ranking for the tools that meet the particular requirements of the case study. The effort in this paper broadens the notion of cloud security monitoring and provides a methodical practical approach to solving a security related issue.
A building automation system (BAS) is an instance of a cyber-physical-system (CPS) in control of building functionalities like lighting, ventilation, CCTVs, and access control. The amount of smart buildings has been growing over the years, introducing new technologies which are now being targeted by attackers. In this work, we present the first collection of publicly disclosed security incidents involving Building Automation Systems (BAS). We then provide a qualitative study of attackers targeting BAS and unveil their main characteristics and differences to traditional CPS attackers. We learn that, generally speaking, BAS attackers show a lower sophistication level and that most BAS attacks target the smart IoT components present in modern buildings. Further, access to the BAS is often not the attacker's final goal but just a mean to achieve their actual goal. Lastly, we do not observe any advanced, state-sponsored BAS attacks hinting that these play less of a role in BAS (compared to CPS).
To protect a system from potential cyber security breaches and attacks, one needs to select efficient security controls, taking into account technical and institutional goals and constraints, such as available budget, enterprise activity, internal and external environment. Here we model the security controls selection problem as a two-stage decision making: First, managers and information security officers defme the size of security budget. Second, the budget is distributed between various types of security controls. By viewing loss prevention with security controls measured as gains relative to a baseline (losses without applying security controls), we formulate the decision making process as a classical portfolio selection problem. The model assumes security budget allocation as a two objective problem, balancing risk and return, given a budget constraint. The Sharpe ratio is used to identify an optimal point on the Pareto front to spend the budget. At the management level the budget size is chosen by computing the tradeoffs between Sharpe ratios and budget sizes. It is shown that the proposed two-stage decision making model can be solved by quadratic programming techniques, which is shown for a test case scenario with realistic data. (C) 2016 The Authors.

There are many organizations using databases to store and hide confidential data. Some of these data are published through World Wide Web (WWW) and the remaining data are hidden. Unfortunately, the attackers usually try to access and steal these hidden data by attacking the structure and the content of the database using an attacking technique called Structural Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA). This technique gives the attackers illegal authorization to execute queries on database through the vulnerabilities in input boxes and page URL's. These queries may reveal or change the confidential data. Many techniques are available in the literature to prevent and detect SQLIA. However, these techniques do not consider languages other than the English language such as Arabic, Greek, and Japanese. Therefore, these techniques may not be able to discover attacks using such languages. In this paper, we present a formal approach to detect and prevent common types of SQLIA considering multi-languages. We formalize tautology and alternative encoding attacks using regular expressions and finite automata. We consider cases not discussed in the literature. Furthermore, we provide regular expressions and code in ASP.net which can be used by developers to detect and prevent attacks on websites that use Microsoft SQL server 2014 (MS SQL). We validate our work manually and by using tools. Results show that our model can detect and prevent SQL injection attacks including languages other than the English language.
in this paper user verification and identification system on touch screen mobile devices is proposed. The system examines the keystroke dynamics and uses it as a second authentication factor. The study proposes a prototype for a keyboard application developed for collecting timing and non-timing information from keystroke dynamics. In addition to other mentioned in literature studies, we propose complex password combination, which consists of text, numbers, and special characters. Strengthening access control using artificial neural networking model is suggested. Neural network model based on multilayer perceptron classifier which uses back propagation algorithm is proposed. This paper presents a unique approach for combining timing and non-timing features together, as it includes several non-timing features such pressure, size, and position in addition to the duration time features. Several experiments have been done based on specific machine learning for data mining and classification toolkit named WEKA. The obtained results show that keystroke dynamics provides acceptable level of performance measures as a second authentication factor. The distinguishable role for non-timing features beside the timing features is demonstrated. These features have a significant role for improving the performance measures of keystroke dynamic behavioral authentication. The proposed model achieves lower error rate of false acceptance of 2.2%, false rejection of 8.67%, and equal error rate of 5.43% which are better than most of references provided in the literature.
"The cheapest form of communication in the world today is email, and its simplicity makes it vulnerable to many threats. One of the most important threats to email is spam; unsolicited email, normally with an advertising content sent out as a mass mailing. Malicious spam is spam with malicious content in forms of harmful attachments or links to phishing websites. In the case of educational institutes, malicious spam threatens the privacy and security of large amount of sensitive data relating to staff and students. Hence, a system that can automatically learn how to classify malicious spam in educational institutes is highly desirable. In this paper, we aim to improve detection of malicious spam through feature selection, with focus on the educational field. We propose a model that employs a novel dataset for the process of feature selection, a step for improving classification in later stage. This dataset is unprecedented as no research in the literature was intended to serve malicious spam detection in a specific domain or field such as the educational field. Feature selection is expected to improve training time and accuracy of malicious spam detection."
Digital forensic is the process of collecting, preserving and analyzing the evidence obtained from the digital media, which start from the moment of collecting these evidence. On the other hand, if the file system is corrupted or deleted, then file carving techniques should be established to restore the maximum amount of deleted data, especially, the fragments. File carving is a methodology that helps the investigators to retrieve and acquire the data from unallocated space. There are many carving techniques are used to find different types of file such as (PDF, XML, JPEG. etc.). This paper will focus on the JPEG file carving techniques since the JPEG is the most widespread loss compression formats used by digital cameras. The main contribution of this paper is to review the existing techniques for JPEG file carving and evaluate them to identifying their characteristics. Also are classified according to the types of carving techniques used, fragmentation handling issues, and the existence of file system. Additionally, a hybrid method proposed to perform special tasks depending on fragmentation handling issues. To the best of our knowledge, this paper becomes a step forward for researchers interested in carving techniques by helping them finding the best algorithm for carving and obtaining any deleted data in cyberspace.
"Traditional access control systems lack the ability to cope with dynamic environments where several factors can affect the decision-making process. On the contrary, Risk-based access control systems offer a preeminent alternative where multiple risk factors sway the access control decision. Nonetheless, risk is often measured qualitatively, and is subject to uncertainty; thus, making it susceptible to underestimating or overestimating its value. Conversely, Fuzzy Inference System has been proven effective in solving problems where uncertainty has a dominant influence over the outcomes, making it an excellent candidate to solve the aforementioned issue. This study improves on the authors' previous work in which risk adaptive hybrid RFID access control system is proposed. In this study, a multilevel fuzzy inference system is designed as a supplementary risk assessment model where risk is estimated using fuzzy logic controller. The results showed that the proposed design has significantly improved the overall risk calculation process."
"Attacks of Ransomware are increasing; this form of malware bypasses many technical solutions by leveraging social engineering methods. This means established methods of perimeter defence need to be supplemented with additional systems. Honeypots are bogus computer resources deployed by network administrators to act as decoy computers and detect any illicit access. This study investigated whether a honeypot folder could be created and monitored for changes. The investigations determined a suitable method to detect changes to this area. This research investigated methods to implement a honeypot to detect ransomware activity, and selected two options, the File Screening service of the Microsoft File Server Resource Manager feature and EventSentry to manipulate the Windows Security logs. The research developed a staged response to attacks to the system along with thresholds when there were triggered. The research ascertained that witness tripwire files offer limited value as there is no way to influence the malware to access the area containing the monitored files."
With an ever-increasing trend of cybercrimes and incidents due to software vulnerabilities and exposures, effective and proactive vulnerability management becomes imperative in modern organisations regardless large or small. Forecasting models leveraging rich historical vulnerability disclosure data undoubtedly provide important insights to inform the cyber community with the anticipated risks. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for statistically analysing long-term vulnerability time series between January 1999 and January 2016. By utilising this sound framework, we initiated an important study on not only testing but also modelling persistent volatilities in the data. In sharp contrast to the existing models, we consider capturing both mean and conditional variance latent in the disclosure series. Through extensive empirical studies, a composite model is shown to effectively capture the sporadic nature of vulnerability time series. In addition, this paper paves the way for further study on the stochastic perspective of cyber vulnerability proliferation towards more accurate prediction models and better risk management.
This chapter focuses on the risks in online medicine purchasing and utilises a theoretical framework - respectable deviance to underpin how the risks are challenged. Incorporating three stages involving the construction of deviance, the justification of deviance and the management of respectability, respectable deviance provides insight into how online medicine consumers account for their activity, which sometimes transgresses regulation and disputes authority.
This article introduces and applies an integrative model of cyberharassment victimization. The model combines routine activity theory (RAT), the general theory of crime (GTC), and the personal resources approach to analyze risk factors for victimization while acknowledging the protective role of a sense of mastery. Survey respondents were aged 15 to 25 years (N = 4816) from the U.S., Finland, Spain, and South Korea. Logistic regression models were used to analyze cyberharassment victimization. RAT-related factors were positively associated with cyberharassment victimization. Low self-control was positively associated with cyberharassment victimization in the U.S., Finland, and Spain but not in South Korea. The sense of mastery was negatively associated with cyberharassment victimization in the U.S., Finland, and South Korea but not in Spain. Protective factors against cyberharassment victimization should be utilized in future studies as adequate knowledge of protective factors could assist policymakers in generating preventative measures against cyberharassment. Our study demonstrates the benefits of integrating criminological theories and protective factors in studies using cross-national data to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of cyberharassment.
In the cyber security landscape, the human ability to comprehend and adapt to existing and emerging threats is crucial. Not only technical solutions, but also the operator's ability to grasp the complexities of the threats affect the level of success or failure that is achieved in cyber defence. In this paper we discuss the general concept of situation awareness and associated measurement techniques. Further, we describe the cyber domain and how it differs from other domains, and show how predictive knowledge can help improve cyber defence. We discuss how selected existing models and measurement techniques for situation awareness can be adapted and applied in the cyber domain to measure actual levels of cyber situation awareness. We identify generic relevant criteria and other factors to consider, and propose a methodology to set up cyber situation awareness measurement experiments within the context of simulated cyber defence exercises. Such experiments can be used to test the viability of different cyber solutions. A number of concrete possible experiments are also suggested.
This chapter provides concluding remarks, drawing together the research on the opportunities and risks for online medicine consumers. It highlights the significance of the respectable deviance framework in understanding how consumers utilise the opportunities and respond to the risks involved in online medicine purchasing. It is argued that an analysis of online medicine purchasing must be located in a critical discussion of construction and hegemony.
The major goal of this chapter is to overview and present selected emerging technologies for cybersecurity. In the first part we show the practical realisations of the bio-inspired concepts for cybersecurity. We do not focus on discussing the bio-inspired techniques on a high and abstract level, but we focus on our own practical developments. We want to present concrete solutions with the magazine-like language understandable to all readers. Our goal is to prove that the bio-inspired techniques can be really implemented to protect networks and that the readiness level of such technology is constantly increasing. In this chapter, we present and focus on our own results and give references to our past and on-going cyber security projects where we successfully implemented different nature-inspired solutions.
This chapter considers the new opportunities for purchasing medicine provided by the Web. These opportunities are incorporated within the challenges to the pharmaceutical market place, governance and regulation, and healthcare expertise fused with the discourses on risk. In the first instance an investigation into the routes to online medicine purchasing is undertaken utilising the empirical research data, before the chapter turns to how regulation is navigated by distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate online medicine purchasing. Qualitative accounts involving challenges to healthcare expertise are also presented.
Decentralized cryptocurrencies still suffer from three interrelated weaknesses: Low transaction rates, high transaction fees, and long confirmation times. Payment Channels promise to be a solution to these issues, and many constructions for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereuem, are known. Somewhat surprisingly, no solution is known for Monero, the largest privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, without requiring system-wide changes like a hard-fork of its blockchain like prior solutions. In this work, we close this gap for Monero by presenting the first provably secure payment channel protocol that is fully compatible with Monero's transaction scheme. Notably, the payment channel related transactions are identical to standard transactions in Monero, therefore not hampering the coins' fungibility. With standard techniques, our payment channels can be extended to support atomic swap of tokens in Monero with tokens of several other major currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc., in a fungible and privacy-preserving manner. Our main technical contribution is a new cryptographic tool called verifiable timed linkable ring signatures (VTLRS), where linkable ring signatures can be hidden for a pre-determined amount of time in a verifiable way. We present a practically efficient construction of VTLRS which is fully compatible with the transaction scheme of Monero, and allows for users to make timed payments to the future which might be of independent interest to develop other applications on Monero. Our implementation results show that even with high network latency and with a single CPU core, two regular users can perform up to 93500 payments over 2min (the block production rate of Monero). This is approximately five orders of magnitude improvement over the current payment rate of Monero.
This chapter presents the issue of online medicine purchasing and outlines the rationale and aim of the book. The reader is introduced to a novel theoretical framework - respectable deviance, to understand how online medicine purchasing has been constructed and in responding to this, how consumers justify and manage their behaviours. The chapter also describes the methodology, including ethical considerations of undertaking online research. It concludes by summarising the key areas and definitions involved in online medicine purchasing.
In this paper, we develop a language-agnostic methodology to extract features of interest to an analyst from forum posts and visualize them in a way which facilitates identification and stratification of areas of interest in the forums, as well as further manual analysis of the text. We then apply this methodology to a specific Russian underground forum. The visualization acts as a 'thumbnail' for individual posts, conveying semantic metadata of post contents. By viewing the thumbnail, an analyst is provided with an immediate 'sense' of post length and key features present within a post, as well as their frequency and spatial arrangement. Using the generated visualizations of posts from the underground forum we speed up analyst identification of post subject matter by up to 72%. As a key novelty, we propose that the image output of our method has fractal properties that can be exploited when sorting threats and extracting highly technical posts. Thus, we use a method based on the Minkowski-Bouligand fractal dimension to prioritize analysis of posts which represent more sophisticated threats.
Use of IP addresses by courts in their decisions is one of the issues with growing importance. This applies especially at the time of the increased use of the internet as a mean to violate legal provisions of both civil and criminal law. This paper focuses predominantly on two issues: (1) the use of IP addresses as digital evidence in criminal and civil proceedings and possible mistakes in courts' approach to this specific evidence, and (2) the anonymisation of IP addresses in cases when IP addresses are to be considered as personal data. This paper analyses the relevant judicial decisions of the Slovak Republic spanning the time period from 2008 to 2019, in which the relevant courts used the IP address as evidence. On this basis, the authors formulate their conclusions on the current state and developing trends in the use of digital evidence in judicial proceedings. The authors demonstrate the common errors that occur in the courts' decisions as regards the use of IP addresses as evidence in the cases of the IP addresses anonymisation, usage of the in dubio pro reo principle in criminal proceedings, and the relationship between IP addresses and devices and persons.

"Current network security systems are progressively showing their limitations. One credible estimate suggests that only about 45% of new threats are detected. Therefore it is vital to find a new direction that cybersecurity development should follow. We argue that the next generation of cybersecurity systems should seek inspiration in nature. This approach has been used before in the first generation of cybersecurity systems; however, since then cyber threats and environment have evolved significantly, and accordingly the first-generation systems have lost their effectiveness. A next generation of bio-inspired cybersecurity research is emerging, but progress is hindered by the lack of a framework for mapping biological security systems to their cyber analogies. In this paper, using terminology and concepts from biology, we describe a cybersecurity ecology and a framework that may be used to systematically research and develop bio-inspired cybersecurity."
The purpose of this paper is to present the importance of terminology related to child sexual exploitation, and is based on a research project that included five European countries (Slovenia, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom and Poland) and Europol. A qualitative approach was used to analyse the data, which was collected by means of unstructured interviews, which focused on the term child pornography, which is commonly used all over the globe. Nevertheless, the term child pornography, while appropriate from the linguistic aspect and widely known, accepted, and used in many official documents and by experts in different fields, might be misleading for non-experts who might not be aware of the seriousness of the crimes related thereto. Many different expressions can be found in the area of child sexual exploitation and much consideration must be devoted to this topic to avoid any misunderstandings. The main goal of this paper is to suggest terms that are applicable, relevant, understandable, and inoffensive to the victims as these crimes have a major impact on their lives. The term child pornography is therefore slowly being abandoned in professional circles, as it minimises the seriousness of the criminal offence and contributes to the stigmatisation and re-victimisation of victims. On the basis of the research findings, the authors agree that term child sexual exploitation material [CSEM] should be used instead of child pornography. In addition, there is also another relevant term that can be used as a CSEM subtype, i.e. child sexual abuse material [CSAM].
In multimedia forensics, learning-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance in determining origin and authenticity of images and videos. However, most existing methods are challenged by out-of-distribution-data, i.e., with characteristics that are not covered in the training set. This makes it difficult to know when to trust a model, particularly for practitioners with limited technical background. In this work, we make a first step toward redesigning forensic algorithms with a strong focus on reliability. To this end, we propose to use Bayesian neural networks (BNN), which combine the power of deep neural networks with the rigorous probabilistic formulation of a Bayesian framework. Instead of providing a point estimate like standard neural networks, BNNs provide distributions that express both the estimate and also an uncertainty range. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework on a classical forensic task: resampling detection. The BNN yields state-of-the-art detection performance, plus excellent capabilities for detecting out-of-distribution samples. This is demonstrated for three pathologic issues in resampling detection, namely unseen resampling factors, unseen JPEG compression, and unseen resampling algorithms. We hope that this proposal spurs further research toward reliability in multimedia forensics.
While website domain typosquatting is highly annoying for legitimate domain operators, research has found that it relatively rarely presents a great risk to individual users. However, any application (e.g., email, ftp, ...) relying on the domain name system for name resolution is equally vulnerable to domain typosquatting, and consequences may be more dire than with website typosquatting. This paper presents the first in-depth measurement study of email typosquatting. Working in concert with our IRB, we registered 76 typosquatting domain names to study a wide variety of user mistakes, while minimizing the amount of personal information exposed to us. In the span of over seven months, we received millions of emails at our registered domains. While most of these emails are spam, we infer, from our measurements, that every year, three of our domains should receive approximately 3,585 legitimate emails meant for somebody else. Worse, we find, by examining a small sample of all emails, that these emails may contain sensitive information (e.g., visa documents or medical records). We then project from our measurements that 1,211 typosquatting domains registered by unknown entities receive in the vicinity of 800,000 emails a year. Furthermore, we find that millions of registered typosquatting domains have MX records pointing to only a handful of mail servers. However, a second experiment in which we send honey emails to typosquatting domains only shows very limited evidence of attempts at credential theft (despite some emails being read), meaning that the threat, for now, appears to remain theoretical.
Breast cancer (BC) is the second most prevalent type of cancer among women leading to death, and its rate of mortality is very high. Its effects will be reduced if diagnosed early. BC's early detection will greatly boost the prognosis and likelihood of recovery, as it may encourage prompt surgical care for patients. It is therefore vital to have a system enabling the healthcare industry to detect breast cancer quickly and accurately. Machine learning (ML) is widely used in breast cancer (BC) pattern classification due to its advantages in modelling a critical feature detection from complex BC datasets. In this paper, we propose a system for automatic detection of BC diagnosis and prognosis using ensemble of classifiers. First, we review various machine learning (ML) algorithms and ensemble of different ML algorithms. We present an overview of ML algorithms including ANN, and ensemble of different classifiers for automatic BC diagnosis and prognosis detection. We also present and compare various ensemble models and other variants of tested ML based models with and without up-sampling technique on two benchmark datasets. We also studied the effects of using balanced class weight on prognosis dataset and compared its performance with others. The results showed that the ensemble method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods and achieved 98.83% accuracy. Because of high performance, the proposed system is of great importance to the medical industry and relevant research community. The comparison shows that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.
Digital sovereignty has become a buzzword in digital policies. Contrary to the imaginary of digital transformation as preceding an era of limitless global networking in the 1990s, approaches to state regulation and delimitation of data flows as well as programmes for national digital infrastructures are justified with calls for digital sovereignty across very different contexts. This forum brings together contributions from political geography, law, computer science, and ethics that compare and analyse discourses and practices of digital sovereignty. The case studies on Russia and the EU reveal parallels as well as fundamental differences in the conception and implementation of digital sovereignty. Essays on the challenges posed by new forms of cross-border interaction (such as cloud computing) and new actors (such as digital platforms) illustrate that the traditional coupling of concepts of sovereignty, territoriality and the state, of jurisdiction and borders, must be rethought. The essays in this forum thus make it clear that the digital transformation is not simply a socio-technical modernisation process. It is rather shaped in specific ways and should be understood and analysed as (geo)-political discourses and practices. The forum contributes to the development of a political digital geography that analyses how the digital transformation is contested and produced in specific ways and unearths the politics and spatialities conceived and produced in these discourses and practices.
